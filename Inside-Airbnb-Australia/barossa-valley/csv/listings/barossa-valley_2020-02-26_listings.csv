Whether it's water skiing, wake boarding or attempting a new water based activity we will endeavour to give it a go.  We may not walk for a few days after, but that's another story. We love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation.

I am fortunate to work in Australia's oldest family owned winery and so meeting people is literally part of my job and just love it.

The Barossa is known for its food, wine, music, heritage and hospitality and along Seppeltsfield Road we offer this in spades!! Apart from our visually beautiful location with vineyards and rolling hills, we are surrounded by boutique cellars doors, three of the Barossa's best restaurants and the iconic winery Seppeltsfield Estate. Here they offer not only bespoke wine tours including tasting a 100 year old Tawny and a heritage winery tour, but also the Jam Factory studio with artisans in residence. These include a knifemaker, milliner, shoe maker and potter. You can even book to make your own knife (but plan and book well ahead!) You will also find Vasse Virgin who make luxe Olive oil body and food products. Other wineries include Hentley Farm, Barossa Valley Estate, Two Hands, Greenock Creek Wines, Kalleske, Whistler, Tscharke, Seiber and Torbreck, to name just a few! Seppeltsfield is the perfect place for walking. The u","Very occasionally and depending on the season there may be work required to be done in the vineyard. This is always worked around a guest's stay where possible and rarely impacts on our guests because we usually have control over this.  Having said that, guests are often intrigued and interested in what needs to be done in the vineyard and enjoy speaking to us about what it's like to have a vineyard and grow grapes.","Being in a rural region, you will ideally need your own car. If coming from the airport we are an easy one hour drive on a mostly dual lane highway to within 4 kilometres of the cottage. Otherwise there are many excellent tour operators who offer private or group tours. We have an excellent taxi service in the Barossa. Some guests use a taxi or private tour operator for airport transfers and for touring if they really do not want to drive. As previously mentioned, we also offer guests complimentary restaurant transfers to Appellation, Hentley Farm or Fino restaurants on one night of their stay. There are also several cellar doors within walking distance (500 metres to 3 kilometres). We use the services of an excellent bike hire company who will deliver your bikes to the cottage, or you can drive to their business and ride designated Barossa bike trails from there.","Guests have exclusive use of the cottage and their own private gardens surrounding it.  They are also welcome to explore the 25 acre property, helping themselves to any fruits and vegetables in season (including figs, pomegranites, cherries, plums etc). Guests can walk through the neighbouring vineyards to Fino retaurant (10 minutes) and Hentley Farm restaurant (5 minutes).","We are always contactable. We are either on the property or guests have our private mobile phone details and we check our emails very regularly.

Having been in luxury accommodation previously in a boutique Barossa hotel I am now enjoying the more personal and intimate side of running this beautiful BnB.  I love the ever changing culture of the Barossa, the friendly community feel and sharing with guests local knowlege and the best kept secrets of this wonderful region. This keeps life interesting and fulfilling!

Also with an interest in photography and home styling I get to indulge in this passion with photos for our website, social media and other projects.

Having recently taken over from the previous owners my aim is to continue to provide the highest level of service and quality luxury experience for our guests.  

Peter and Sharyn (original owners) spent two years back in 2001 restoring this 1850s early German settler's cottage from a ruin into premium Barossa accommodation and are very proud to have helped preserve some precious Barossa history. I love to share their story and the history of the cottage with our guests.

With nearby Seppeltsfield Estate undergoing a renaissance, we find ourselves in one of the Barossa's ""go to"" destinations, Seppeltsfield.

I enjoy anticipating, meeting and exceeding our guest's expectations!

Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

My name is Crystal i was born in Broken Hill Rural NSW before moving to Gawler in 2001. I have a huge passion for hospitality, having owned and managed several cafes in and around Gawler this has provided me with extensive experience on what people expect from a hospitality experience I strive to deliver that experience with excellence, quality and affordability. I absolutely love being a Air B&B host and meeting new people. 
We have three B&B’s one of which is at our home one in Lyndoch and the other also in Gawler. 

I have a belief in energy and how that is spread from one person to another this has lead me down a path of holistic health and well-being I run meditation classes, restorative and yin yoga classes, I am a reiki practitioner, forensic healer, Psych- k facilitator, massage therapist, NLP and Timeline Therapist, and a Hypnotherapist.

I look forward to meeting you some time

Why? I hear you ask... Whether it's for a business or personal trip, I'm focused on providing my guests with the best experience possible and I'm all about going the extra mile to ensure someone has everything they need to feel like they're right at home, no matter how long or short the stay.

I always aim to ensure my properties are hotel quality clean, stocked full of utensils, linen, towels and all the essentials you need.

My door is always open and no request is too small so if you need anything you can always reach me. My help is 24/7 online and I'm only a 20-minute drive away. That's Adelaide!

Lastly, if and when something doesn't go to plan (which isn't often but let's be honest, life isn't perfect) I promise to always be transparent and honest and will do everything in my power to make things right.

About me:

I'm an outgoing, friendly and humorous guy who looks forward meeting new people, traveling to interesting places and loves a tasty chicken burger!

I live in Adelaide with my lovely fiancé, Hannah who is a Registered Nurse and works in paediatric anaesthetic-recovery. We made the move from NSW to South Australia in 2019 to find a more relaxed lifestyle and set ourselves up for the future.

I was born in Bristol - England, my family and I moved to sunny Australia in 1991, so I grew up in Australia sound Australian, probably look Australian so I call myself Australian!  I'm just lucky enough to have two passports which is great for galavanting the globe.

I also hold a Bachelor Degree in Media and ultimately pursued a career in Software & I.T, working for various companies in Sydney. 

I've worked for start-up companies in various roles and I'm passionate about learning the different ways technology helps move business and society forward.

I have a bald head but it's a good shape so I'm lucky! My friends and family call me Googie (like an egg) I dunno! You can just call me Rich.

I also:
- Enjoy exercising and (trying to) be healthy. 
- Cats & Dogs. 
- Trying new foods. 
- Telling (bad)  jokes and (trying) to make people laugh. 
- Try to be a good listener and help people when I can.

I look forward to hosting you via Airbnb, if you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.

Happy travels!

I live between Collingwood on the Northside of Melbourne - and the beautiful Barossa Valley in South Australia. I love Collingwood and it's surrounds: the food, the shopping, great coffee and an eclectic community. But I also love the serenity in the valley and it is such a wonderfull contrast and so good for the soul. When I am in either location I pop the other on Airbnb so that I can share all that I love. I am passionate about design which is reflected in my homes, and I love to immerse myself in the local culture of the places that I live and visit. I know the importance of having a home to return to after a day of exploring and have ensured that I have kept my homes as truly liveable spaces.  I am proud to share them with like-minded guests and I know that you will enjoy your stay in either 'the Wood' (Collingwood), or the valley.
