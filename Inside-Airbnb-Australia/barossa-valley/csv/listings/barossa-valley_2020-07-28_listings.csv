Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality is loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices.

Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality is loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices.

Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality is loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices.

This is always worked around a guest's stay where possible and rarely impacts on our guests because we usually have control over this.  Having said that, guests are often intrigued and interested in what needs to be done in the vineyard and enjoy speaking to us about what it's like to have a vineyard and grow grapes.","Being in a rural region, you will ideally need your own car. If coming from the airport we are an easy one hour drive on a mostly dual lane highway to within 4 kilometres of the cottage. Otherwise there are many excellent tour operators who offer private or group tours. We have an excellent taxi service in the Barossa. Some guests use a taxi or private tour operator for airport transfers and for touring if they really do not want to drive. As previously mentioned, we also offer guests complimentary restaurant transfers to Appellation, Hentley Farm or Fino restaurants on one night of their stay. There are also several cellar doors within walking distance (500 metres to 3 kilometres). We use the services of an excellent bike hire company who will deliver your bikes to the cottage, or you can drive to their business and ride designated Barossa bike trails from there.","Guests have exclusive use of the cottage and their own private gardens surrounding it.  They are also welcome to explore the 25 acre property, helping themselves to any fruits and vegetables in season (including figs, pomegranites, cherries, plums etc).

Having been in luxury accommodation previously in a boutique Barossa hotel I am now enjoying the more personal and intimate side of running this beautiful BnB.  I love the ever changing culture of the Barossa, the friendly community feel and sharing with guests local knowlege and the best kept secrets of this wonderful region. This keeps life interesting and fulfilling!

With an interest in photography and home styling I get to indulge in this passion with styling the cottage and photos for our website, social media and other projects.

Having recently taken over from the previous owners my aim is to continue to provide the highest level of service and quality luxury experience for our guests.  

Peter and Sharyn (original owners) spent two years back in 2001 restoring this 1850s early German settler's cottage from a ruin into premium Barossa accommodation and are very proud to have helped preserve some precious Barossa history. I love to share their story and the history of the cottage with our guests.

With nearby Seppeltsfield Estate undergoing a renaissance, we find ourselves in one of the Barossa's ""go to"" destinations, Seppeltsfield.

I enjoy anticipating, meeting and exceeding our guest's expectations!

Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

We decided to make our home a BnB when we had it for sale and then I was made redundant. When one door closes another one opens and I have always wanted to have a BnB, so I thought now was a good idea! 
The Barossa is a beautiful part of the world to live and we like exploring what it has to offer and discovering new places. 
When we go away we like to feel like we are being spoilt. That's why I am passionate about doing whatever I can to make your stay enjoyable. It's your time off and you want to feel rested and leave with good memories. My aim is to make you feel at home.
Hope you can come and stay sometime! :-)

We offer you cheese and biscuits to match with the wines you've discovered, great breakfast provisions including muesli, yogurt, freshly baked local bread, homem",none,"The famous weekly Barossa Farmers Market is just a kilometre away, open every Saturday morning - amazing produce, you'll also make friends in the short queue for a superb coffee. Just across from the market is the award winning Vintners Restaurant, and we are situated not far from the four main villages of Angaston, Nuriootpa, Tanunda and  Greenock. From ice creams, handcrafts, boutiques and pubs, we can recommend something to suit your preferences. Likewise, cellar-door tours, balloon flights and more can easily be arranged, all picking up from your cottage. Or just lay in one of our hammocks with a great bottle of wine and a book, we can supply most of your needs until sundown. We want you to become another returning guest, looking forward to your next stay with us - Your home from home, 'In The Vines'.","We even have great mountain bikes with new helmets for daily hire. Just bring yourselves, we've thought of the rest!","With little traffic, no traffic lights for miles, and only one small roundabout five kilometres away, you might enjoy driving yourselves.  However, without a designated driver and fifty or more cellar doors to visit, we can recommend great value tours, in classic cars, motorcycles, or modern limousines. The local taxi companies are also reasonable for return trips back from lunch. We can always arrange to collect your car the following morning. Alternately, ask about our bicycles for hire,  or if you're up for an easy five kilometre walk with five cellar doors on route, you'll be home before you know it - Just ask us how.","When staying at 'In The Vines' Guest Cottage, you are welcome to walk around the entire vineyard, ideally keeping to the perimeter tracks. Or, just lie back in one of the hammocks for two!","Being a working vineyard, we are never far from the property.  Always happy to offer suggestions for cellar doors to discover, perfect local lunch or dinner spots, or almost anything else we can assist you with. Perhaps a glass of wine, a sundowner, if we catch each other. We can also appreciate you might just want some P&Q (peace & quiet), just let us know in your booking, or on arrival.","",,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/9babb788-18c0-49ca-9998-5e3d8188217f.jpg?aki_policy=large,,261496601,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/261496601,Josie & Andrew,2019-05-13,"Light Pass, South Australia, Australia","Andrew and I are an easygoing couple, enjoying our life out in the country where we grow grapes, tend our fruit trees, and enjoy mixing within the local community spirit that is country Australia.
