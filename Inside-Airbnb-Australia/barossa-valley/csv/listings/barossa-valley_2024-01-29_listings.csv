Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices. 
My mantra carpe diem. 
I can't wait to greet you and share a little of my Barossa home.

Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

This is Barossa country chic at its finest with a clean style that is as comfortable as it is design savvy. 

This reinvented getaway dates back to the 1840s. Stretch out in the Chaff House, a workshop where grain was once crushed, or hole up in the Dairyman’s Cottage for a stay that shares a similarly unique past, operating more recently to milk cows. Both pads now make up a relaxed and unpretentious Barossa getaway and can be booked in conjunction with one another or as separate retreats. 

Guests can quite literally wake up and smell the bacon, thanks to a healthy spread of breakfast provisions and other fresh produce that come directly from paddock to plate. And although your Barossa itinerary is likely to be teeming with sojourns to cellar doors and eateries, it's hard to overlook the peace that lazing in the shade of the South Australian sun brings. Take in the rich pastures and surrounding panoramas of the grape-dotted Barossa Valley Ranges, by spending the evenings on the paved terrace with your feet up, sipping a glass of something smooth from neighbouring vineyards. 

It's instinctual to wander the working dairy facility, so why not introduce yourself to the residents on an afternoon farm walk and feed the heritage breed free-range pigs. And if there are any items you can no longer live without when back home, The Dairyman has an online shop to keep you stocked up on breakfast packs and more.

This is Barossa country chic at its finest with a clean style that is as comfortable as it is design savvy. 

This reinvented getaway dates back to the 1840s. Stretch out in the Chaff House, a workshop where grain was once crushed, or hole up in the Dairyman’s Cottage for a stay that shares a similarly unique past, operating more recently to milk cows. Both pads now make up a relaxed and unpretentious Barossa getaway and can be booked in conjunction with one another or as separate retreats. 

Guests can quite literally wake up and smell the bacon, thanks to a healthy spread of breakfast provisions and other fresh produce that come directly from paddock to plate. And although your Barossa itinerary is likely to be teeming with sojourns to cellar doors and eateries, it's hard to overlook the peace that lazing in the shade of the South Australian sun brings. Take in the rich pastures and surrounding panoramas of the grape-dotted Barossa Valley Ranges, by spending the evenings on the paved terrace with your feet up, sipping a glass of something smooth from neighbouring vineyards. 

It's instinctual to wander the working dairy facility, so why not introduce yourself to the residents on an afternoon farm walk and feed the heritage breed free-range pigs. And if there are any items you can no longer live without when back home, The Dairyman has an online shop to keep you stocked up on breakfast packs and more.

The Rusty Olive was built in 1900 and was bought in an unrestored state by Sue and Michael Falkenberg in 2008. Sue and Michael then spent some 8 years restoring it to the magnificent building you see today. The original stonework was preserved, and the interior completely rebuilt with a sympathetic mix of modern and existing features. 

The home was designed as a luxury retreat and has been operating as an Airbnb since 2018. In April 2022, Sue and Michael sold the property to the current owners, Adam and Marilyn Laws. They fell in love with the Rusty Olive after staying for two weeks early in 2022. Marilyn grew up in the Barossa Valley and most of her family still reside here. Now based in Sydney, they regularly return “home” to experience the great lifestyle and family experiences in the Barossa.

I'm an artist and business owner living  in the Barossa Valley. I love characterful houses, homes and hospitality and I have  three accommodations available in South Australia.
I have a weakness for beautiful stone homes typical to South Australia, that have a European feel. I appreciate natural light, wooden floorboards, enhancing architectural features and preserving what works from the past whilst adding charm and modern comforts. I like my guests to feel they have a stylish home away from home. 
My renovations style is comfy French provincial with a touch of vintage and original artworks on the walls for a restful and inspiring stay.
I travel a lot myself so I appreciate what it is to arrive to a place that feels like you can kick your shoes off, pour a wine and relax.
