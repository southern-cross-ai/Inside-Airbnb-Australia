Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

The Rusty Olive was built in 1900 and was bought in an unrestored state by Sue and Michael Falkenberg in 2008. Sue and Michael then spent some 8 years restoring it to the magnificent building you see today. The original stonework was preserved, and the interior completely rebuilt with a sympathetic mix of modern and existing features. 

The home was designed as a luxury retreat and has been operating as an Airbnb since 2018. In April 2022, Sue and Michael sold the property to the current owners, Adam and Marilyn Laws. They fell in love with the Rusty Olive after staying for two weeks early in 2022. Marilyn grew up in the Barossa Valley and most of her family still reside here. Now based in Sydney, they regularly return “home” to experience the great lifestyle and family experiences in the Barossa.
