Occasionally you may see some of the local wildlife like mice and snakes around the place, but we do do our best to keep them at bay. Its all a part of country living! Our property was burnt out in the Pinery Fire in 2015, destroying the majority of our vineyard, all the fences, gardens and a lot of the trees. We are gradually rebuilding and replanting.

Green, leafy and with a main street that is full of interesting shops and some beautiful parks.  There are plenty of coffee spots, (including ours!) and eateries in Angaston.  As previously mentioned, the little Italian cooking school and restaurant Casa Carboni is a stand out, as is The Barossa Valley Cheese Company.  Yalumba Winery is a two minute drive away and Saturday morning Barossa Farmers Market is about 3km down the road.","",It's all walking distance to so much and just a short drive to everything else.  It couldn't be easier or more convenient.,"The B&B includes a private courtyard, shaded by an ancient currant vine (planted in 1912) and decked out with a red gum picnic table and a barbeque.   Next to the courtyard is a covered car port for guests to park and access to the B&B is via a door within the courtyard.","We will always be available for our guests.  While they are staying with us, they are honoured members of our family and we are here to look after them and make sure that their time in the Barossa is a wonderful experience.","Mainly it's the smoking thing- by all means, smoking is permitted, but only outside.

My love of animals has seen me work as a veterinary surgeon for many years and that is reflected by the menagerie that lives with me, including three Icelandic horses, the dogs- Audrey, Lynch, Finn and Percy and the meet and greet goats, Nancy Drew and Inspector Frost.  My beautiful flock of geese can also be found, wandering around the property, looking very stately.
As well as working as a vet, I also run a small restaurant out of a local cellar door, Edenmae Estate, on the weekends; fresh, innovative local food is a great passion of mine, as are the amazing wines that my beautiful Barossa produces.

My name is Crystal i was born in Broken Hill Rural NSW before moving to Gawler in 2001. I have a huge passion for hospitality, having owned and managed several cafes in and around Gawler this has provided me with extensive experience on what people expect from a hospitality experience I strive to deliver that experience with excellence, quality and affordability. I absolutely love being a Air B&B host and meeting new people. 
We have three B&B’s one of which is at our home one in Lyndoch and the other also in Gawler. 

I have a belief in energy and how that is spread from one person to another this has lead me down a path of holistic health and well-being I run meditation classes, restorative and yin yoga classes, I am a reiki practitioner, forensic healer, Psych- k facilitator, massage therapist, NLP and Timeline Therapist, and a Hypnotherapist.

I look forward to meeting you some time

I love to cook and share my table with family and friends.  I love the smell of a freshly picked lemon and fresh herbs.  I love my little animals and the flocks of different birds that play and swoon across Pondicherri.   I’m social and then sometimes,  I’m a bit reclusive.   I love sunrises more than sunsets but both are spectacular and I’m lucky enough to experience and appreciate often.   I’m grateful for living in a place that affords  peace and privacy.   And I enjoy meeting people!  The  AirBnB adventure is a wonderful way to engage with many different people from far and wide.  To gain a deeper appreciation of the spirit of place - and it’s unique culture - staying with those who live there becomes a rich and memorable experience.

It’s a beautiful region, with villages, vineyards and farms dotting a patchwork vista. Barossans are famous for their generous hospitality, their love of a shared table and their passion for local food and wine. Festivals, celebrations, markets and music thrive here. Barossa is life’s great pleasures, in one unique place.  Every Saturday morning from 7.30am to 11.30am, you can taste and take home the best the Barossa has seasonally on offer. Over 50 stallholders provide a cornucopia of the freshest vegetables, meats, breads and cheeses. Delicious oils, preserves, and local specialities give you everything you need for your stay. The growers at the Barossa Farmers Market often pick their lettuce and tomatoes and other produce just the night before market, sometimes even that very morning. Many of them grow organically.

Guests staying more than seven days will have a complete change of linen and restocking of amenities on Day Seven unless you advise us otherwise.","Angaston is a charming, bustling village of 2,000 people which today still proudly displays a unique, English-influenced character. It was named after one of South Australia’s founders, George Fife Angas, who sponsored many of the region’s early German Settlers. Home to the oldest public building in the Barossa and replete with beautiful examples of classic 19th century architecture, Angaston rewards a slower pace and an enquiring eye. Angaston is also a rambling food lover’s paradise, with some of the Barossa’s finest produce on display. The Barossa Farmers’ Market is an absolute must-see experience while a gentle stroll down Angaston’s elegant main street will reward you with vibrant cafés, homemade preserves and lunch options a’plenty. The southern end of Angaston is home to casa carboni, the Barossa’ very own Italian epicenter, where Chef Matteo offers cooking classes and a traditional enoteca, right next door to the Barossa Valley Cheese Company where you can taste a selection of ","Guests can sit under shady veranda's or wander the gardens, cook a barbecue or use the well equipped kitchen. .","",- No noise after 10pm Small to medium sized well behaved dogs are welcome.,,,https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/79b9363d-1bfe-41cb-b876-1bbce5905835.jpg?aki_policy=large,,47848742,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/47848742,Ian,2015-10-31,"Saint Georges, South Australia, Australia","Ian & Jane run two properties with Air BnB.

I am a writer and cultural historian. For 8 years, I was the Executive Director of a  Multicultural Arts Centre in Adelaide. I purchased Ithaka Getaway Cottage over 10 years ago as I love the drive down to this spot at the tip of the beautiful Fleurieu Peninsula, where the Adelaide Hills meet the sea, and where the best views of Kangaroo Island are to be experienced. I also like to share and manage my other weekender, BarossaJourneys Townhouse,  located north of Adelaide in the famous Barossa Valley. I have a special attachment to this place as i have researched and written about this place for over 20 years. One of my books, 'Barossa Journeys: into a valley of tradition', has been just reprinted in its third edition. My long experience of this wonderful place led me to want to share the uniqueness & 'hidden' treasures of the Barossa with others. I wrote ""Barossa Journeys"" to tell the story of how this unique wine and cultural region came to be: not only its history of viticulture &  wines,  but also the story of the coming of the Lutherans & their foodways, customs, architecture and their folk tales; as well as their celebrations of harvest, music, gourmet and other festivals, and much, more! After many years of research and writing about this unique cultural region, I purchased a  townhouse of innovative design, located just 2 minutes walk from Tanunda's vibrant main street. My interests include philosophy, classical music (especially opera), reading, bushwalking,  yoga, and painting. I'm easygoing &  respect people's privacy and right to enjoyment. My life motto?

We like the rural feel where we live, with vineyards just over our back fence, but we are minutes to the centre of the township. We enjoy our wine and food and the opportunity to relax, so we understand that our guests might just like to be left to do their own thing and enjoy some time out. We like to take short impromptu getaways. Hubby loves his footy and horse-racing hence Foxtel in the cottage for people who may not want to miss a game while away. I enjoy gardening as being surrounded by a natural setting is important to me.
