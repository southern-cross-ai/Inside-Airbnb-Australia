Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices. 
My mantra carpe diem. 
I can't wait to greet you and share a little of my Barossa home.

Having been in luxury accommodation previously in a boutique Barossa hotel I am now enjoying the more personal and intimate side of running these beautiful BnB's.  I love the ever changing culture of the Barossa, the friendly community feel and sharing with guests local knowledge and the best kept secrets of this wonderful region. This keeps life interesting and fulfilling!

With an interest in photography and home styling I get to indulge in this passion with styling the cottage and Retreat and taking photos for our website, social media and other projects.

Peter and Sharyn (original owners) spent two years back in 2001 restoring the 1850s early German settler's cottage from a ruin into premium Barossa accommodation and creating the beautiful vineyard and gardens you see today. They are very proud to have helped preserve some precious Barossa history. I love to share their story and the history of the cottage with our guests.

I enjoy anticipating, meeting and exceeding our guest's expectations! 

My philosophy of ""it's the little things that count"" will be evident when you stay with us.

Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

The Rusty Olive was built in 1900 and was bought in an unrestored state by Sue and Michael Falkenberg in 2008. Sue and Michael then spent some 8 years restoring it to the magnificent building you see today. The original stonework was preserved, and the interior completely rebuilt with a sympathetic mix of modern and existing features. 

The home was designed as a luxury retreat and has been operating as an Airbnb since 2018. In April 2022, Sue and Michael sold the property to the current owners, Adam and Marilyn Laws. They fell in love with the Rusty Olive after staying for two weeks early in 2022. Marilyn grew up in the Barossa Valley and most of her family still reside here. Now based in Sydney, they regularly return “home” to experience the great lifestyle and family experiences in the Barossa.
