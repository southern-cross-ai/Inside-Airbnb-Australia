There are no close by neighbouring houses, you are moments off of the Sturt Highway which leads you to the heart of the Barossa in 10 minutes and to Adelaide in 50 minutes. The studio is situated at the southern end of our property which is close to the Sturt Highway, this is great for access but you can hear the road noise from the studio. You are surrounded by the Barossa Ranges, vineyards and broadacre crops. No one will bother you here! Only our little miniature schnauzers Hugo and Alfie, who likes to come and say hello from time to time!","The Studio is located on an old vineyard. We are in the middle of rebuilding the vineyard as the Pinery Fire in 2015 destroyed the majority of our lovely vines.  Also, it is good to remember that this a farm and we are surrounded by broad acre crops and vineyards. Occasionally you may see some of the local wildlife like mice and snakes around the place, but we do do our best to keep them at bay. Its all a part of country living! Our property was burnt out in the Pinery Fire in 2015, destroying the majority of our vineyard, all the fences, gardens and a lot of the trees. We are gradually rebuilding and replanting. It's a very slow process but we will return the property back to its former glory soon enough.","A car is a must if staying at the Studio. There is no public transport available. Your car has its own double carport! Taxi's are available. The Airport Flyer also is available. The closest public transport is in Gawler, only 10 minutes away, with trains and buses available.  Tour buses pick up guests regularly from the The Studio.","The Studio is a converted shed. With half of the shed converted into living quarters and the other half remains an implement shed for the vineyard equipment. There is a door joining the two areas but this remains locked at all times.  Guests will have access to all the living areas, bathroom and bedroom and are also very welcome to wander through the orchard and vineyards around the Studio. The Studio does not have a washing machine. But there are laundry mats in Gawler and guests can use the clothes line out the back of the studio.  Please be conscious that this is a working vineyard and machinery does move around the vineyard from time to time. Also, we are very rural and have numerous wildlife come to visit including foxes, mice, kangaroos, emus, snakes and endless birds.","The Studio is totally self contained with access to the property via a locked security key box. The code is given to guest prior to arrival. We understand that guests like to be independent and not disturbed, so we leave you to your own devices. But, as we are only 500mt away, if there are any problems, we are close by to lend a hand or offer some advice on where to go and what to see. The Studio also has a wide array of local brochures and maps.","Check-in time is from 2PM onwards unless with prior arrangement. Check out time is by 10am unless with prior arrangement. No smoking inside the property. If smoking on the deck, please dispose of all butt. Be very careful with smoking outside as we live in a high fire risk zone and were severely effected by the Pinery Fire in 2015. Two people maximum sleeping in the property, unless with prior arrangement. A portacot can be arranged if a baby is required to stay. Feel free to pat the ponies but be aware that the fence is electrified. The ponies love apples and carrots but nothing else please. Please be aware that this is a rural property and we coexist with little creatures such as rabbits, lizards, mice and the odd snake. Please take care.

The Barossa is known for its food, wine, music, heritage and hospitality and along Seppeltsfield Road we offer this in spades!! Apart from our visually beautiful location with vineyards and rolling hills, we are surrounded by boutique cellars doors, three of the Barossa's best restaurants and the iconic winery Seppeltsfield Estate. Here they offer not only bespoke wine tours including tasting a 100 year old Tawny and a heritage winery tour, but also the Jam Factory studio with artisans in residence. These include a knifemaker, milliner, shoe maker and potter. You can even book to make your own knife (but plan and book well ahead!) Other wineries include Hentley Farm, Barossa Valley Estate, Two Hands, Greenock Creek Wines, Kalleske, Whistler, Tscharke, Seiber and Torbreck, to name just a few! Seppeltsfield is the perfect place for walking. The undulating hills and palm lined road with many historic and beautiful landmarks a","Very occasionally and depending on the season there may be work required to be done in the vineyard. This is always worked around a guest's stay where possible and rarely impacts on our guests because we usually have control over this.  Having said that, guests are often intrigued and interested in what needs to be done in the vineyard and enjoy speaking to us about what it's like to have a vineyard and grow grapes.","Being in a rural region, you will ideally need your own car. If coming from the airport we are an easy one hour drive on a mostly dual lane highway to within 4 kilometres of the cottage. Otherwise there are many excellent tour operators who offer private or group tours. We have an excellent taxi service in the Barossa. Some guests use a taxi or private tour operator for airport transfers and for touring if they really do not want to drive. As previously mentioned, we also offer guests complimentary restaurant transfers to Appellation, Hentley Farm or Fino restaurants on one night of their stay. There are also several cellar doors within walking distance (500 metres to 3 kilometres). We use the services of an excellent bike hire company who will deliver your bikes to the cottage, or you can drive to their business and ride designated Barossa bike trails from there.","Guests have exclusive use of the cottage and their own private gardens surrounding it.  They are also welcome to explore the vineyard and the 25 acre property, helping themselves to any fruits and vegetables in season (including figs, pomegranites, cherries, plums etc). Guests can walk through the neighbouring vineyards to Fino retaurant (10 minutes) and Hentley Farm restaurant (5 minutes).","We are always contactable. We are either on the property or guests have our private mobile phone details and we check our emails very regularly. We enjoy socialising with guests if this is something they wish to do, but are very aware of offering privacy for those who desire this. We offer a wine tasting of our Seize the Day Shiraz to guests who have an interest in wine.",Permission from the owners  is required before people other than paying guests are allowed on the property.

Helping guests discover and enjoy the best of the Barossa makes life interesting and fulfilling.

Peter and I spent two years restoring our 1850s early German settler's cottage from a ruin into premium Barossa accommodation and are very proud to have helped preserve some precious Barossa history. Now, with nearby Seppeltsfield Estate undergoing a renaissance, we find ourselves in one of the Barossa's ""go to"" destinations, Seppeltsfield.

I love my family and grandchildren, gardening, food and wine (of course!) We have lots of great friends here in the Barossa. It's a fabulous place to live with lots of festivals and music and wine events. 

I enjoy anticipating, meeting and exceeding our guest's expectations!
