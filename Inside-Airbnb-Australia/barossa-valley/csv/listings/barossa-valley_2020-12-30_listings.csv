Thank you reading some of my bio.
Sharing a love of travel and discovery awarded me the opportunity to call the township of Angaston my Barossa home, my life and my passion. 
I would love nothing more than to welcome you and share some of my favourite authentically Barossa things to do.
Whether it's exploring a winery or two. Purely for research purposes of course. Taking in the local markets, catching up with friends while sourcing some locally grown produce to accompany our world class wines.  Walking or jogging and taking in the serenity of the every changing seasonal countryside. And sometimes sharing that space with wild kangaroos is majestic. 
You may even find me in a quaint little winter sunny spot or curled up with a good read in front of the fire.
The yang side of my personality is loves nothing more than changing up the pace a bit.  Pop on some bright lippy,  jump on a scoot'ntoot scooter while getting some Barossa wind on my face.
I enjoy attempting all manner of sports and outdoor activities. Learning some footy skills from the local teens or switching up to my summer pace, water skiing & wake boarding.
I love open air concerts, festivals, camping, gardening, building/construction/renovation. 
My latest interest is self sustainability and environmentally sustainable practices.

Pinecone Ridge is really a family project - we are all involved: Anne, Josh, Jeb, April & Isla.

We purchased the property in Nov 2017 as a family escape & renovation project. The property had previously been owned by a 92 year old gentleman with poor eyesight & needed lots of attention but we could see the potential & loved the views & location.

Running Pinecone Ridge is a family affair. April creates the welcome signs. Isla collects the pinecones. Jeb is Josh’s right hand man when it comes to maintenance. I get the privilege of escaping to the Barossa every week to clean & prep & often Josh is able to join me. In school holidays the kids help too. And we have all contributed to the eclectic styling of the home!

We have created Pinecone Ridge to be our family getaway - cosy, comfortable, fun, creative, peaceful, surrounded by nature - a place in which to clear the head & relax into a slower pace of life, yet also close to the action & deliciousness of the Barossa. We love sharing it with you and reading your reviews together. May you have a wonderful stay!

Peter and Sharyn (original owners) spent two years back in 2001 restoring the 1850s early German settler's cottage from a ruin into premium Barossa accommodation and creating the beautiful vineyard and gardens you see today. They are very proud to have helped preserve some precious Barossa history. I love to share their story and the history of the cottage with our guests.
