1125097,10081118,2014-01-29,1898281,Rus,"Great host and amazing accommodation!  <br/><br/>We went to celebrate Lizzy's 30th and the Coach House could not have been more perfect.<br/><br/>Flying into Adelaide, we stopped at the Central Market downtown and stocked up on supplies for the weekend.  After an leisurely hour and a bit drive we arrived at Strathlyn BNB where we were met by Heather. <br/><br/>She took us to the Coach House on the back of the property and it couldnt have been nicer.<br/><br/>Great view out of the top level balcony overlooking the vineyard. <br/><br/>A/C and fans proved to be invaluable on a 38 degree weekend!<br/><br/>All amenities are better than expected and all you could want.<br/><br/>This place is a short walk (5 mins) to Saltrams and a 20 min walk to the farmers market on Saturday morning.  <br/><br/>We hired bikes (had them delivered and picked up) and made an easy 25 km loop to quite a few wineries and Maggie Beer's Farm Shop.  There is a great bike path that starts in Angaston and goes into the heart of the Barossa.<br/><br/>"
1125097,10335170,2014-02-14,2725224,Teresa,"A lovely and convenient location, surrounded by grapes!  Far away enough from the main house to have as much privacy as you need.  Breakfast is included - eggs, bacon, juice and a bottle of wine.  If you are keen to cook some of the amazing local produce, there is an electric hot plate and microwave, but no oven.  Aircon works well.  "

1125097,11872081,2014-04-17,10977428,Phillip,The coach house is in a lovely location. We were fortunate enough to be there watch the sun set to the west just as the moon came up over the vineyard to the west. The accommodation is clean and generously appointed. Recommended.
1125097,13189669,2014-05-21,1304769,Lilia,What a great place to stay in Barossa! Luxury private coach house overlooking a vineyard. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and the sunset from the deck. The host was very friendly and helpful.
1125097,14372675,2014-06-17,16453786,Bianca,We had a lovely weekend at Strathlyn Coach House. Heather was a fantastic host. She made us feel very welcome and made fantastic recommendations for our weekend in the Barossa. The Coach House was gorgeous - beautiful views & everything you'd possibly need. The location was great - very close to Angaston & still very private. We'd certainly stay here again.     
1125097,16560082,2014-07-29,1122028,Natasha,"Heather made us feel extremely welcome by telling us a little about the house, and with a bottle of wine and a packed fridge! She's very personably and willing to answer all questions. <br/>The location couldn't be more picturesque and made me so happy to have wine and cheese on the veranda which had uninterrupted views of the vineyard, with not a house in sight. <br/>We would definitely recommend to anyway thinking about staying. "
1125097,19676815,2014-09-16,76497,Chris,"A hidden gem, nestled in the vines between Angaston and Nuriootpa. So quiet and peaceful – I'd highly recommend this to anyone staying for a few days in the Barossa."
1125097,20504718,2014-09-30,20096212,Natalie,The coach house is set in a beautiful location and is conveniently located for exploring the Barossa. Heather was warm and welcoming and had stocked the fridge providing a delicious breakfast spread for us to enjoy at our leisure each morning. The house is well maintained and furnished comfortably. But best of all you can grab a glass of wine and sit on the upstairs balcony while enjoying the sunset and views over the vineyards. Highly recommended.  
1125097,21393629,2014-10-16,9457572,Mark,"The Coach House was very cosy and well appointed in a beautiful setting. Just what we were looking for. Heather made us feel very welcome, was able to answer all our questions regarding the area and gave us some fabulous suggestions regarding wineries, coffee and dining throughout the Barossa and even McLaren Vale."
1125097,22204359,2014-11-01,10624389,Cindy,Lovely stay at the Strathlyn Coach House.  Beautifully situated and conveniently located - we found it to be a great home base for us to explore the Barossa and Eden Valley regions!

All was as expected from the listing! Would definitely recommend it to others. "
1125097,24020179,2014-12-17,16955023,David,A wonderful secluded place in the middle of a vineyard. The cottage was well stocked with breakfast goodies. Information on site was helpful. 
1125097,28774257,2015-03-30,21199797,Penelope,"We had a lovely stay at the Coach House which is a beautifully restored building. It was very comfortable and private, set on the edge of a vineyard. Heather the host was very helpful, there is so much to see and do in the area, great vineyards, cafés, restaurants and on a Saturday the Barossa Farmers Market is just down the road. We would definitely recommend staying at the Coach House!"
1125097,31734308,2015-05-09,26976969,Melissa,"We spent three nights at the coach house. Location was excellent, with nice views from the balcony.  The weather was blustery and cold at times, but there are two heaters provided in addition to the bedroom unit. Kitchen was stocked to make a nice breakfast and simple dinners. "
1125097,35211602,2015-06-16,25014261,Garry,"Our stay at The Coach house was delightful. Heather was friendly and helpful when it came to local info on where to go and what to do.

1125097,37380726,2015-07-06,34329031,Leonie,"Heather was very friendly on our arrival and made us feel welcome at the Strathlyn Estate. <br/>Everything that describes the Strathlyn Coach House on Airbnb is exactly what you get. The bed on mezzanine level was so comfortable with the sun shining through the door to the balcony each morning. You can't ask for anything more with views all round the Coach House. The bacon and eggs which were obviously from local produce were very fresh and yummy.<br/>The Coach House is very private from the main house and has its on driveway so that you can come and go without feeling that you are opposing on the hosts.  <br/>The Barossa Farmers Market is only a short walk from the Coach House and wow the homemade Beef & Red Wine pies and the fruit tarts were amazing.<br/>If you need a relaxing and no fuss weekend or few days away this is the place to stay."
1125097,37899195,2015-07-11,20987637,Troy,We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn house in the Barossa. When we arrived there was a beautiful bottle of wine and breakfast provisions on hand.

1125097,40978732,2015-08-03,33969993,Shara,"We LOVED our stay at Strathlyn coach house, it was such a quaint little stone cottage set in an idyllic setting, surrounded by vines and fruit trees. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay. And to top it all off Heather was a friendly and welcoming host. Cottage was well stocked and had everything we needed, great location also! Close to all the wineries. Will stay again :) "
1125097,45378530,2015-09-02,6576334,Duane,"We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn coach house.  Heather made us feel very welcome and gave us some good insights to local places to visit.<br/><br/>She also provided plenty of cereal, eggs, bacon, bread and milk for breakfast.  It is right next door to Saltram winery and she also left us a bottle of their wine which we enjoyed.<br/><br/>It is a beautiful location nestled in amongst the vines and has a good view of the surrounding area.  The cottage is very private but only a minute walk to the main house.<br/><br/>The Barossa Valley is quite compact and it is an easy drive to most of the wineries.  Angaston is only a minute drive away and Nuriootpa is only about 5 minutes drive.<br/><br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1125097,46889500,2015-09-14,12560317,Natalie,"Heather was a wonderful host. She was very flexible in regards to our check-in time which was very kind. Heather was also very helpful in providing advice on where to visit in the area and things to do. The accommodation is beautiful and very peaceful, with a generous stock of food for breakfast. We used the gym during our stay, the facilities in the gym were perfect for what we needed. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend Heather as a host, and we hope to stay again next time we are visiting the Barossa."

1125097,50177730,2015-10-10,41666843,Hamish,Heather was an absolutely amazing host! Would highly recommend this for accomodation in the Barossa! All the information you need to navigate your way through the wineries is neatly arranged for you by Heather. Breakfast was provided and Heather was always helpful when we needed help on where to head in the valley. An incredibly central location and picturesque surrounds. We were absolutely amazed at how secluded we were yet still so close to everything. Will definitely be back again! Thanks again heather! 
1125097,51364168,2015-10-19,45858541,John,Heather was very friendly welcoming and helpful.  The Coach house is lovely and the setting is peaceful and relaxing. Loved breakfast on te balcony at the back overlooking the vineyards.  It is within walking distance of Saltram's winery and a slightly longer walk or very short drive to the Barossa Farmers Market.

1125097,54110068,2015-11-16,37655181,Lara,Heather was very welcoming and had stocked the house with everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. <br/><br/>The coach house was as pretty in real life as it is in all the pictures and the perfect place for a romantic weekend away for two. We had a lovely afternoon sitting on the balcony overlooking the vineyards with some cheese and wine bought nearby. <br/><br/>There was also a new laundry and gym which unfortunately we didn't have time to use but would definitely be useful if you were planning a longer stay. 
1125097,55975423,2015-12-07,10646560,Hayley,Beautiful converted barn in a stunning setting. Fab wine tasting venue next door and fantastic restaurant down the road in walking distance. We had a lovely time. Heather is very helpful and the barn has everything you could possibly need for a romantic break in the Barossa. The little extras Heather left help you get started and relax you into the break. Thank you.

The coach house was unique, quaint and private but still so close to Angaston for restaurants ect.  Heather provided supplies for a bacon and egg breakfast and a lovely bottle of wine.  We enjoyed having a drink on the rear balcony overlooking the Vineyard.  Recommend the coach house for a stay with a touch of history. Very enjoyable, thank you Heather."
1125097,58938449,2016-01-05,2975981,Kyle,"Great accommodation in the heart of the Barossa.<br/><br/>The coach house is tucked around the back so we felt like we had plenty of privacy. Inside it was clean and comfortable.<br/><br/>Angaston is a cute little town with a small grocery store and some yummy places to eat."

1125097,61490586,2016-02-05,52824036,Michael,"We had a great stay at Strathlyn Coach House in February 2016.<br/>The accommodation was neat, tidy and comfortable, Heather made us feel very welcome and was flawless organised.<br/>This is a great spot to stay if you'd like to be near plenty of local wineries, but not in the heart of Tanunda/Barossa; but have very peaceful and secluded nights.<br/>The view was outstanding, surrounding pleasants and overall was a great find for us."
1125097,62571412,2016-02-15,6920494,Maria,"The Coach house has kept all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. <br/><br/>Heather stocked the fridge with lots of breakfast goodies including bacon, eggs, bread, milk, oj and even a bottle of moscato!<br/><br/>The deck out the back gives a panoramic view of vineyards and was perfect for star gazing and watching the sunrise!<br/><br/>Thank you for your hospitality and sharing your charming cottage with us!"
1125097,64934831,2016-03-09,9474833,Rand,We had a fantastic time in the Barossa and from the get go we felt welcome and at home at Strathlyn. It was very very hot when we arrived and Heather had made sure to cool the coach house down by putting on the aircon earlier. These kinds of thoughtful touches sum up the experience. Situated amongst the vineyards this is a wonderful place to stay in the region.
1125097,66349987,2016-03-22,37121832,Ian,"We really had the most fabulous short break in the Barossa.  Thanks to Heather's suggestions, we got to enjoy the scrumptious fresh produce at the Farmers market, great food and service at Vintner's and Wanera.  We tasted some great wines and met some really friendly and knowledgeable staff at Taste Eden Valley, Turkey Flat, Rockford's, MSV and TeAro.  A highlight was staying in the Coach house @ Strathlyn surrounded by Saltram's vineyards and enjoying a glass or two on the rear deck watching the sun go down or a morning cuppa watching the hot air balloons meander around the valley.  Heather was the perfect host and has added her personal touch to make your stay even more enjoyable.  It was only 4 days but we left feeling relaxed and re-charged!!!  We highly recommend Strathlyn as a great base for a real Barossa experience."
1125097,68506417,2016-04-05,18611402,Lanny,The coach house was very homely and had everything we needed for our two night stay. Heather was very welcoming and even had breakfast for us!

The property perfectly matched the description and was really lovely. The view of the vineyard from the balcony in the morning was wonderful! This is the perfect location in the Barossa as it's close to everything but secluded.
1125097,78975989,2016-06-10,53997653,Dan,A truly beautiful cottage set amongst the vines - a spectacular and unique experience.

1125097,79798120,2016-06-14,10029038,David,"Heather was very helpful in showing us the lovely converted coach house and even had the heating on for us. Generous cooked brekky supplies were included as was an excellent bottle of red, Pepperjack one of our favs! They even have a Nespresso machine. This unique location overlooks the vineyard directly with its own balcony. It's also located minutes away from Salters (who make Pepperjack) & Vintners restaurants; we dined at both and they were excellent.. particularly the award winning Vintners. Here's some photos of this wonderful property & surrounds. (Website hidden by Airbnb)"

1125097,102943582,2016-09-19,84798428,Matt,"Thank you Heather for making us feel so welcome and comfortable during our stay. The coach house was exactly like we imagined and the pictures and description don't do it justice, it was warm and cosy and the views are outstanding. It's very private and secluded away from main dwelling, perfect for a romantic getaway for a few nights but also accommodating for a long stay. We had such a lovely time here, it will stay with us forever! Thanks"

1125097,114937262,2016-11-20,83888401,Alan,"We had a fantastic stay at the coach house. It was a gorgeous setting, nestled in rolling hills of vineyards and beautifully kept gardens surrounding the property. The coach house was clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The newly renovated balcony overlooking the vineyards was perfect for enjoying the complimentary local Riesling. The location was great for tripping around the Barossa Valley. We hired bikes one day and cycled some of the new bike trail, highly recommended. <br/>Thanks again Heather for being a wonderful host."

1125097,136646949,2017-03-11,50436829,Samuel,"An absolutely fantastic air bnb in an absolutely sensational location. Hands down the most incredible experience I have had. The place was cosy and romantic, had a little bit of history and was perfect to come back to after a day on the wineries! The only thing better than this air bnb is Heather herself, who has made (and continues to make for the entirety of your stay) an incredible effort to make your time a memorable one. Five stars does not do this place justice and I will be staying here whenever I return to the Barossa (as long as it isnt booked out!)"
1125097,138077116,2017-03-18,49906487,Chuck,We had a lovely stay here during March. Was great to have some quiet time on beautiful surrounds.

1125097,203887009,2017-10-15,153059432,Raymond,The coach house was everything we needed on our 2 day trip to the Barossa Valley. It was secluded yet reasonable driving distance to all the places we wanted to visit. Heather was a 5/5 house.
1125097,206737793,2017-10-26,34949341,Roberta,"The Coach House is very well positioned for exploring the delights of the Barossa.  It is very quiet and peaceful and the deck off the bedroom is lovely for a cuppa or glass of wine while admiring the view, including a kangaroo and her joey during our stay.<br/>Heather is very helpful and the taxi company she recommended were great.  They took us to restaurants for dinner and were a mine of information.<br/>The downstairs area of the Coach House is quite small although the bedroom is large and airy.  It's an old stone building that was renovated about 20+ years ago set in lovely gardens that are quiet and private."

My brother thought the property was a<br/>Quaint cottage with awesome view over the vineyards. Very close to Angaston, which is a lovely town to explore. ""Country breakfast"" provisions were delicious and very thoughtful."

The accommodation is very cute and cosy, as per the photos the toilet/bathroom is on the ground floor and the bedroom is on the loft, up the stairs. Heather was extremely helpful in providing tips for places to visit, even knowing what would be open on Good Friday. We had a wonderful time."

1125097,271973914,2018-06-02,48133639,Eugene,"Exactly the type of place you wish for when thinking of a weekend in a wine region. The place is private and quiet with beautiful views directly over a local vineyard. A converted coach house with a loft bedroom, it is just the right size for 2 people.<br/><br/>Heather was a lovely host who ran us through the local attractions, and provided us with some breakfast ingredients, wine and other essentials!"
1125097,275390380,2018-06-11,192626455,Madi,Great location and home  for a weekend getaway.

1125097,414184733,2019-02-18,3263629,Chad,"Cute cottage tucked away in a vineyard. What more could a person want? It will be difficult to forget sitting on that back porch watching the sun go down. <br/>Walking distance to Vitners Bar And Grill, (one of the best meals we had on our 3 week Australian vacation).<br/>The bonus was heading out onto the deck for morning coffee and seeing a family of kangaroo (mama, pop and little Joey)20 feet from deck."

Though we didn't cook breakfast, she provided bacon, eggs, bread, and milk. There was also orange juice, coffee, and cereals. Her cottage is in a great location. Secluded but not far from the town and other wineries. It cannot be emphasized enough that the view from the balcony, particularly during sunrise and sunset, is amazing, though the flies can be a nuisance."
1125097,701318492,2020-10-17,191793753,Jacqueline,"A wonderfully restored 1900 cottage, perfectly situated in a way that makes you feel like you are surround by your very own private vineyard. This is a very intimate space and perfect for us on a short stay during our honeymoon. It’s location is perfect for access to the Barossa Valley, our tour picked us up from our front door. You will also be only a short drive from the beautiful town of Angaston for lovely food and atmosphere. Heather provided exceptional hospitality from the bacon and eggs to the local knowledge of the area, absolutely worth a visit."

1125097,717998201,2020-12-25,6357197,Anthony,"Such a lovely private cottage with stunning surroundings!  Plenty of cosy places to sit and enjoy the vineyard scenery. A 3 minute drive to the local town (Angaston) and a very central location to explore the wineries of the Barossa Valley. Plenty of space and amenities provided - a full kitchen, plenty of towels and nice linens as well as a fridge stocked with provisions. There's also a new small, but well-equiped gym and also guest laundry facilities. Heather  is absolutely lovely and a fantastic host. We were gifted a lovely bottle of Barossa Shiraz from the winery right next door (Saltram) to enjoy during our stay as well as surprised us with a lovely bottle of sparkling on our departure day as a Christmas present. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely come back here next time we're spending time in the Barossa Valley. We had a fantastic stay."

1125097,758587006,2021-05-16,5928318,Lausanne,The coach house at Strathlyn was the perfect location for our pre and post wedding day stay. It was ideal being so close to our venue at Saltram Winery.

1133195,22080257,2014-10-29,22510871,Chelsea,"Lemon Tree Spa apartment was a beautiful place for a weekend away. There is a great view outside the windows of vineyards and well kept flowers. Heather has the appartment well stocked with groceries to make a good breakfast to start the day, the nepresso machine is a nice touch. Our first night was spent cracking open the complimentary wine, watching the dvds provided and scouring through the tonnes of information Heather provides about what is around. Heather even provides the bubble bath for the spa. Angaston is a lovely town with a supermarket open til 8, and is close to everything Barossa, yet far enough away to feel completely lost amongst the vineyards. You're in walking distance of Saltram Winery and Vitners Bar and Grill aswell as the town of Angaston if feeling like stretching the legs."
1133195,27775483,2015-03-11,23922905,Aidan,Heather made us feel very welcome and when we had some flight arrival changes she was more than happy to help. The property was exactly as described and I truly wish I could have stayed longer. Beautiful atmosphere and a great leaping point for adventures in the Barossa Valley.
1133195,49651331,2015-10-05,29355110,Kath,"Great location, so close to everything, the bottle of chilled wine in the fridge was a nice touch. Helpful host, very accommodating, lovely relaxing holiday, thank you!"

1133195,71522102,2016-04-25,63056452,Lee,"We were very happy with our stay at the Lemon Tree Spa at Strathlyn. Our host Heather was wonderful, and very helpful when we needed to make an unexpected trip home to attend to an urgent family matter, offering flexibility at the end of our stay after we were able to return. Her genuine interest and generosity was very much appreciated.<br/> The cottage is full of old worlde charm, comfortable and close to all the Barrosa offers, yet set in the middle of vineyards and an orchard, so very peaceful."
1133195,79750733,2016-06-14,72394166,Mitchell,"Heather was a great host, the cottage itself was perfect for a weekend away. A warm welcome with a great explanation on what to do around the area. The Lodge is very close to nearby wineries and small beautiful towns. While the house itself sits on a vinyard. Amazing weekend away, will no doubt be back again soon. "
1133195,86950935,2016-07-18,56456959,Just,"Heather made us feel very welcome and provided some really handy tips for the local area. The accommodation was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. The gardens are gorgeous! <br/>Thank you Heather for your beautiful accommodation. "
1133195,144942158,2017-04-16,2879875,Georg,"Heather is a fantastic host - and has a super friendly family. The lemon tree spa is a cute little house with all you need - full friedge for breakfast -  wirepool, DVD player and a selection of movies, a large garden and a well equipped gym facility! We would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. If you want even better views on the vinyarda just book heathers second accommodation. "
1133195,147122794,2017-04-25,124538850,Caryl,"Easy to find and as requested, Heather left us to our privacy for the whole three days. Lovely."
1133195,159887943,2017-06-12,3364193,Jojo,"We had such a lovely stay at Strathlyn Lemon Tree Spa! My boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights over the long weekend. We had a bottle of wine waiting for us in the fridge along with enough bacon, eggs and bread for an epic fry up the next day. It's an absolutely gorgeous spot, really picturesque, and Heather told us a little bit about the history of the big house. The bed was large and gloriously comfortable. The spa was bubbly and luxurious! We had a wonderful time and would absolutely recommend the place to friends. Ideally located close to Angaston, it's the perfect spot from which to explore the Barossa's Cellar Doors. In fact, I've written a list of the ones we most enjoyed in case it helps anyone! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1133195,199421135,2017-10-01,112438406,Carolyn,"We spent three nights at the Lemon Tree Spa, and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The cottage is nestled in beautiful grounds - there were flowers blooming everywhere when we visited and the view across the adjoining vineyard is stunning. Each night we sat outside with a glass of wine in hand and watched the sun go down over the vines. Just gorgeous. The location is fantastic - about a kilometre from the historic village of Angaston, just off the main road but set back enough to be peaceful and quiet, with all the delights of the Barossa wineries close at hand. <br/><br/>The cottage is fully self-contained and completely separate from the main house. And while it doesn't look fancy from the outside, don't let this fool you! Inside it's beautifully and comfortably furnished, and feels light, airy and spacious.  I've stayed in other B&Bs that are pretty and picturesque, but so cramped that you trip over the furniture all the time. None of that here - there was plenty of room to unpack our things and spread out and relax. We had everything we needed, including pots and pans and kitchen equipment if we wanted to cook, DVDs to watch and magazines and books to read. The fridge was stocked with breakfast supplies and a bottle of wine was thoughtfully provided. I particularly appreciated the little dressing table in the spa area, where I could spread out my cosmetics and 'girly stuff' without getting in the way of my partner. (It's worth noting that while the spa is in a corner of the bedroom, the bathroom itself is located separately and totally private.) <br/><br/>Heather was a genuinely warm and thoughtful host. We were travelling in an open-topped vintage car that needed protection from the weather, and she kindly allowed us to use her private garage. Thanks Heather!<br/><br/>The only issue we had was patchy wi-fi, but apparently this is a problem with the new NBN and out of the host's control. And when the setting is so beautiful, why would you want to stare at your device? <br/><br/>I loved my first trip to the beautiful Barossa, and can't wait to visit again. I won't bother to research accommodation options next time - I'll just book into the Lemon Tree confident that I'll have a wonderful experience. Very highly recommended!"
1133195,202121433,2017-10-10,151746755,Brooke,"This is such a lovely place to stay for a weekend getaway. Heather was a very lovely and welcoming host. The house is very lovely and the spa is great to relax in. It is in a good location within walking distance to a winery and close bike riding or driving distance to Nuriootpa, Tanunda and a variety of wineries around. It's surrounded by a beautiful vineyard which is lovely to go for a walk through. We will definitely be staying again :)"

Heather was incredibly helpful in showing us around the cottage and providing great dinner suggestions. Communication was great and key pick up was super easy. The cottage was so clean and well looked after. Great location, so close to amazing restaurants and we had a great time discovering the Barossa during the day. The spa was a lovely way to relax at the end of the day. My highlight was eating the beautiful breakfast provided outside, in the wonderful garden. Picturesque views! A dreamy weekend.

1133195,500246628537247629,2021-11-21,290046349,Hilary,We were attending a wedding at Sultrams Winery so the location is fabulous for that. We ended up staying in the Old Coach House - which has been converted into a one bed cottage. It is very cute and was perfect for us as we were amongst vineyards and almond trees. It was a great place to switch off and unplug - as there is no internet at the Couch House (perfect) buy you could walk 30m to the gym and connect if you needed to. We used the small gym which is part of the booking.

It really is just as lovely as the pictures! Strathlyn is really handy to Saltram winery and a fantastic restaurant and bar just up the road for an evening meal. And Heather's brekky really hit the spot! We hope to return again some day - thank you. 
1133236,30806619,2015-04-27,24310701,Kate,"We had the most wonderful stay at Strathlyn. Heathers hospitality, delightful breakfast, beautiful property and spot on tour and restaurant recommendations meant we had a 10/10 experience in the Barossa"

1133236,255898739,2018-04-22,17740875,Chris,We absolutely loved Heathers place and wished we could have stayed longer. Such a beautiful old homestead surrounded by lovely gardens and picturesque vineyard landscape. We really enjoyed the old world charm of the room and taking pictures in the Autumn colours around the property. Heather was very easy to communicate with and also gave us some great tips on places to eat nearby. Also Heather went out of her way to locate some information that I was seeking on the history of a particular wine maker that had been in the region for a long time. The check in was a breeze and heather was very flexible with the times. We look forward to returning to heathers beautiful home in the near future. Highly recommended.
1133236,329857695,2018-09-30,100750405,Jade,Beautiful estate in a great location!

Heather is very lovely, she made sure we had everything we needed, and even reminded us of the daylight savings change during our stay. <br/>We stayed in the 'Lily' room. The room had everything we needed,  comfy bed, the Spa was brilliant (it is a two-person spa, and has a 'long side' so both of us could stretch out our legs!) and it was in a very convenient location, while being super quiet.<br/>We will stay here again on our next visit to the Barossa."

1133236,744803334,2021-04-02,7904639,Lydia,"It’s the little things that make this stay so memorable. The interior design is both calming and intriguing.

1710462,8503728,2013-11-03,5924987,Uyen,"A huge thanks to Tom and Kylie for making our trip through the barossa valley such a memorable experience. They were amazing hosts who went above and beyond our expectations. Tom, we are so grateful for your knowledge, experience and most of all your generosity in taking out the time to share that with us. This was definitely an awesome place to stay, highly recommended!"
1710462,8578734,2013-11-05,2187145,Sunni,"Kylie & Tom were thoughtful and caring hosts who made sure we had everything we needed and let us know they were nearby while leaving us to relax in peace in their quiet studio.<br/>It's a good value bolt hole and the location is great if you're looking to tour the Barossa by car. It's lovely to be in the vines on their property. Thanks again!"
1710462,9137601,2013-12-09,724537,Alison & Jean-Philippe,"The Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed was a great base for a weekend of winery touring in the Barossa Valley. Very affordable (so you can spend more money on wine and food!), extremely comfortable, with high quality appliances and mostly Ikea furnishings. Even though we came prepared with soap and shampoo, it was all supplied, which was a lovely surprise. The setting was also lovely, set amongst the vineyards. It would be hard to get accommodation of this quality at the same price in the Barossa. Why would you stay at a dodgy, dated motor inn, when you can stay in a modern, inviting place like Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed! "
1710462,9368992,2013-12-24,10180676,Justin,"We had a great stay at the ""Shed."" It's located a little bit away from the main towns in the Barossa, but is very convenient and a perfect location for visiting the local wineries. In fact, being outside of town was a big plus for us. It has everything you'll need on site as well - we were able to enjoy a couple of relaxed nights in while cooking our own meals and enjoying local wines. A great spot for a visit to wine country. "
1710462,9465200,2013-12-30,3648835,Sitihassulaini,"We stayed for 2 night at Kylie and Tom's.  This is really an eye opener experience for us.  The location of the studio is awesome.  I love the idea of staying in the middle of grape field.  Our GPS broke down and we got lost on our way to the studio.  Tom is very helpful, he fetched us when we lost and the check in  went very smooth.  The Studio is very nice and clean. All I can say, I love everything about our stay and Barrossa Valley is very unique.  Thanks a lot to Tom & Kylie"
1710462,9543341,2014-01-02,4876046,Saa,"Lovely self sufficient studio, left with some personal touches. Great location if you want to stay a little bit away from the wineries. Would highly recommend it!"
1710462,9757596,2014-01-08,3371250,Martin,"The Studio in the Vineyard is just beautiful! Very clean, spacious and the most perfect location. I would recommend it to everybody who's going to explore the Barossa Valley!"
1710462,9808018,2014-01-11,11004799,Thomas,"Great little getaway, perfectly situated to visit into the Barossa. Modern kitchen was clean and housed everything needed to cook a light dinner to enjoy with a local wine, looking upon the vines at our doorstep!!!"
1710462,9988829,2014-01-23,19004359,John,"This was the perfect place to stay for a trip to the Barossa! Close to all the wineries, and sitting on a vineyard itself, it was comfortable  and pleasant."
1710462,10065706,2014-01-28,6534569,Aaron,Great litttle bouncing board for our little  3 night trip to the Barossa.    Gave us the opportunity to sample the cullinary delights of the Barossa at our leisure.   The property is located pretty much 15 mins away from anywhere you might want to get to to sample the local produce.   The Studio is privately situated and had everything we needed for 3 nights stay.   Clean and comfortable at a very competitive price.  Would definitely come back.
1710462,10160631,2014-02-03,11466874,Mark&Jiseon,"Great location in the middle of a paddock and vineyard, the hosts have thought of every little detail to make your stay perfect. We got a bunch of nice food and from the area and used the fully equipped kitchen to make an amazing meal. The weather on our stay was over 40 but we were cool in the house thanks to a/c and fans. "
1710462,10410038,2014-02-17,6706172,Tim,"It was a real pleasure to stay in this ""shed"". Very relaxing, quiet and private with wonderful views over the vineyards. Accommodations just as described and very well equipped. Kylie and Tom were great hosts. Highly recommended."

1710462,10981800,2014-03-16,9130694,Jane,"Kylie and Tom's studio amongst the vines is a modern and spacious place to stay in. Well situated on the Sturt Highway at the entrance to the Barossa Valley, the studio had everything you would need and more. Kylie was very generous offering us a later checkout even when we hadn't requested it. "
1710462,11115286,2014-03-21,9271107,Erin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Shea Oak Log and Kylie and Tom were great hosts - very helpful when we needed something, but otherwise left us on our own. The studio has a great kitchen for cooking and is just a nice, comfortable space to relax in."

The apartment is located just off Sturt Highway, so it is easily accessible from Adelaide and a perfect spot for exploring the Barossa Valley."
1710462,11536228,2014-04-07,11645618,Carol,"We stayed for two nights in the Shea-Oak vineyard studio in early April and really enjoyed both the rural environment and the Barossa Valley wine. We were on a long trip so it was especially good to have a good bed, quiet, and a good place to cook for ourselves. The interior of the studio is smart and comfortable. Many thanks!"
1710462,11814570,2014-04-15,5037288,Jamie,"We loved our stay at the Shea-Oak studio! Set right amongst the vineyards and only a 10 minute drive to town we were perfectly positioned to get the most out of our stay in Barossa. The unit is actually a 1 bedroom (not a one room studio as I first assumed as an American) and comfortably spacious. The kitchen is fully renovated and equipped with everything you might need to cook a meal at home - important when you are buying wine during the day for evening consumption! The bed was extremely comfortable (loved the heating pad). All in all, great unit and excellent value for the Barossa!"
1710462,11890736,2014-04-18,12975854,Gerry,"A superb place to stay - it's got all the necessities and is situated in a terrifically convenient location. It takes just 45-60 mins to get into the heart of the Barossa (if you take the scenic route, like we did) but if you need to get to Gawler quickly, it's just 15 mins away.<br/><br/>Lovely hosts and a great spot. "
1710462,11976823,2014-04-20,9397048,Linda,"We nestled in Kylie & Tom's studio shed right away. Stayed 2 nights, with a comfortable bed, clean amenities and a convenient drive to the Barossa Valley. Beautiful wine region. Kylie and Tom were friendly and made sure we got to the place ok. Our morning was amazing with the sun shining in the studio with the view of vineyards around us. Will definitely visit again."
1710462,12057023,2014-04-22,4276223,Rónán,Great place. Has everything you need for the perfect stay in the Barossa. 
1710462,12149391,2014-04-24,3871540,Lucy,We had a great time staying in the studio. It is much larger than we expected and we appointed! The accommodation is very comfortable and clean and the hosts were available if needed. The location is near to the highway approaching the Barossa Valley so we enjoyed only having to travel for 10 minutes to get to many of the cellar doors. Thanks for the great stay Kylie and Tom!
1710462,12218976,2014-04-26,14066354,Demetrio,A fantastic few days in the Barossa in this beautiful studio fitted with all the essentials and close to all the best parts of the Barossa. Highly recommend and would stay again. 
1710462,12717157,2014-05-09,13425770,Natasa,"We had an enjoyable 2-night stay at the Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed. Kylie and Tom responded promptly to our emails before we arrived. Directions on the listing were spot-on and check-in/check-out was easy. The studio shed was clean and spacious. The kitchen was well-appointed which was great for dining in. Good supply of tea, coffee, milk and cereal. We loved being so close to the vines. A fabulous base to explore the wineries in the Barossa Valley!"
1710462,13248626,2014-05-23,13275565,Kriz,"This accommodation was well above expectations - the picture was very accurate of the clean,well designed accommodation"
1710462,14083250,2014-06-11,14529878,Rebekah,"We absolutely loved our stay. The cabin was in a central position in the Barossa and it was exceptionally clean. <br/> <br/>Kylie and Tom were great hosts. We would definitely go back. "
1710462,14305134,2014-06-16,9274232,Thoa,"We loved staying at Kylie and Tom's converted shed - great location, all the modern amenities, cozy and perfect for all our needs. They were gracious and thoughtful and had the place warmed up for us by the time we arrived as we walked in on a very stormy day. Looked forward to getting back every night after a full day of local sightseeing and wine tasting. Thanks again Kylie and Tom!"
1710462,14635627,2014-06-23,9155378,Han,"Amazing place! It was so beautiful, so cozy, but with all the amenities. Kylie had the heating turned on ready for our arrival, and Tom - our hero - met us with his tractor to drag us out of a bog - serious service!! It was such a cute place, and was an easy drive to the wineries. "
1710462,15596680,2014-07-12,14535456,Col,"Kylie and Tom provide private and comfortable accomodation with great facilities. We found the Shed to be a perfect launching pad into the Barossa and Kylie had the Air con on so even though outside was 5 degrees we immediately felt cosy! <br/>Facilities were great - comfy bed with chocolate supplied! and a choice of teas and coffees!<br/>Would highly recommend The Shed to all - in fact I have already told half a dozen of my friends - reasonable rates and excellent hosts!"
1710462,15848847,2014-07-16,3239808,Belinda,"What a great experience.  It would have to be the cleanest and best equipped air bnb I have stayed in.  Kylie and Tom were great to deal with and very accommodating.  A great gateway to the Barossa Wineries.  I can highly recommend, and I will be back. "
1710462,15987578,2014-07-19,3858886,Angela,"A clean, cosy and convenient place to stay while exploring the Barossa. We did not meet Kylie and Tom as you are able to come and go and enjoy the space privately. But a little schnauzer did come say hello. It is great value when compared to the other available accommodation in the area, equipped with a very handy kitchen and a very comfortable and beautifully presented bed. The hosts left a great list of vineyard recommendations all of which we loved visiting. "
1710462,16986046,2014-08-05,16640283,Josie,"Wonderful accommodation on a beautiful little vineyard, in a great location to visit the Barossa Vineyards"
1710462,17884058,2014-08-18,4785244,Geri,"Check in and finding the property was easy, and it was a close drive to the Barossa. Room was super comfortable and we had everything we needed available, with lovely considerate small touches. Would stay again :)"
1710462,18152390,2014-08-22,14839062,Carlene & Tony,"We had a wonderful stay In the Barossa.  The converted shed is really cozy, had everything we needed, comfy and warm bed.  It was a lovely retreat whilst exploring the Barossa.  Was a little noise from traffic in the morning but only as a light sleeper would notice.  Great accommodation, thanks Tom and Kylie for having us and porridge which I hadn't had in years - delicious! "
1710462,18317893,2014-08-25,17585817,Laura,"The property was exactly what we needed for touring the Barossa, the pictures fairly represent what you get, it was clean and well equipped.  The shower was excellent, bed was good and the electric blanket was a godsend on the cold spring nights.  It is worth noting however that there is road noise 24/7 so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  Overall excellent value for money and very well situated."
1710462,20491348,2014-09-30,7337390,Robert,The Studio was a great base for exploring the Barossa. It is really well equipped and very comfortable and while nothing is within walking distance all of the main centres are within a short drive. We did not meet Kylie and Tom but they were great with communications including arrival instructions.
1710462,20740559,2014-10-05,13928153,Pat And Rob,Perfect in every way!    Wonderful place. 
1710462,20891426,2014-10-07,1472976,Dylan & Charlie,"Accommodation was perfect, in a great location.  Everything as per the pictures."
1710462,21505291,2014-10-19,16554299,Jillana,"We never met our host, but everything was waiting for us when we arrived in Barossa.  The place was FANTASTIC, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and location.  This property is a gem!  The only thing we wanted for was wi-fi, which was found in local coffee houses nearby."
1710462,21664969,2014-10-21,16267536,Nadia,"We had a great stay at Kylie and Tom's. Spacious and modern accommodation, great location- great for a weekend exploring the Barossa! Kylie and Tom were communicative and friendly. Definitely recommend!  "
1710462,22015819,2014-10-28,7045592,Shelley,"Kylie and Tom's Shea-Oak Vineyard Studio was very clean and well presented. It was well priced and in a good location about 15 minutes drive from most of the vineyards and nearby towns. Kylie and Tom were helpful hosts. When we needed to contact them they were available. They left us welcoming chocolate biscuits, as well as tea, coffee and some milk. The studio was well priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on the edge of the Barossa Valley."
1710462,22288796,2014-11-03,15064936,Michael,Cosy and comfortable place to stay close to the Barossa. Close to the Sturt Hwy for easy drives to the main wineries.
1710462,22600268,2014-11-10,8079668,Monique,"The place was lovely, it had everything we needed and then some. The kitchen was so well stocked with cooking utensils it was so easy to cook without having to make any compromises. The bed is so comfy too. Overall it's a great little place to stay out of the way but still with great access to the central towns of the Barossa Valley. The couple of times we needed to speak to Kylie she was very friendly and helpful. We would love to stay there again & recommend it to everyone."
1710462,22902979,2014-11-17,567406,Sarah,Amazing place! Literally right on a vineyard with everything you could want in an accommodation. A must stay for your Barossa trip. We'll be back.
1710462,23014819,2014-11-20,23198083,Bronwyn,"Accurate description. Hosts always friendly and available if needed but happy to let us keep to ourselves. Good communication. Loved the locality, spacious quarters, very clean, comfortable, well equipped and pleasant decor. Set back from the road but fairly busy truck route-not too noisy but noticeable. Easy drive to Barossa Valley attractions, pleasant drive to Adelaide area, Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley."
1710462,23421516,2014-12-01,12947304,Aaron," Our hosts Kylie and Tom were keen, friendly and helpful communicators and at the same time allowed us privacy during our stay. Kylie and Tom's set up at Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio is comfortable, neat and tidy, with nice quality furniture and fittings throughout and are all appreciated after a hard day's exploring. In particular, the kitchen is well-equipped and the bedroom furniture appears new. The bed is very comfortable. It is also well-situated as a base to explore the nearby wine regions. Highly recommended accommodation."
1710462,23936393,2014-12-15,2942799,Sandra,"We had a wonderful time staying at Shea-Oak Log vineyard studio.   The studio was more than the pictures : with chocolates on our pillows, extra bedding for our kids, strong shower with hot water, fully equipped kitchen with wine glasses, organized cutlery and cooking utensils, including cable TV.  There was even an electric blanket for us, little details but so thoughtful for guests.   The location is perfect to drive up to Adelaide Hills and explore Barossa Valley on a daily basis.  Short drives and easy access to come home every day.  A perfect retreat with all the comforts of a studio."
1710462,24130741,2014-12-21,16645757,Vaurian,"Beautifully appointed studio, cosy and comfortable with everything you need for a stay in the Barossa. About 15 minutes to Nuriootpa and a few more to Tanunda and Angaston which is great for day trips to winery's but maybe a little far if you want to go in for dinner, we only went out 1 night in 3.<br/>Kylie and Tom live in a fabulous part of Australi"
1710462,24599377,2014-12-31,14404888,Sonny,"Our stay at Kylie and Tom's studio shed was very pleasant and comfortable. The hosts were flexible and accommodating in arrival & departure times. Everything just went very smooth and seamless. The kitchen is fully equipped and has cutlery, pots & pans to cook. The bathroom comes with towels. It was a perfect base to explore Barossa! Highly recommended."
1710462,25016945,2015-01-05,15239363,Simon,"'The Shed' was a fantastic spot for our stay, surrounded by vines with no-one around other than Kylie and Tom's home about 500m away, this really did feel like our very own quiet slice of the Barossa. The studio had everything we needed including aircon which Kylie switched on for us before our arrival (it was very warm on the two days we were there 40+). Although we had very little contact with Kylie and Tom they left us with everything we needed, including breakfast. A brilliant place to stay for any couple's Barossa experience!"
1710462,25467753,2015-01-17,23759431,Deirdre,"We stayed at Shea-Oak whilst exploring the Barossa. It was a great location, away from the hustle & bustle but close enough to enjoy everything. The house was clean, relaxing, spacious & had everything we needed. It was a great place to stay. "
1710462,25559127,2015-01-19,25440952,Kenneth,"Awesome place and not too far from where all the action is. Tom was awesome and personally brought us some brand new wine glasses when there was only 1 there. <br/>Cute and cozy place. Nice and convenient "
1710462,25666032,2015-01-22,8888331,Jacqui,Kylie and Tom left us to our own devices which was convenient for us. They were available by telephone and made sure we knew that they were approachable. We had to call them when we were having issues with the oven and Kylie came quickly to the rescue! We had an excellent weekend and felt like the Studio Shed was our little home for the short time we had there. 
1710462,25858239,2015-01-27,20840948,Kate,We loved our stay at the studio! Kylie and Tom where so lovely and not only did we feel at home we had everything we could possibly need! A little gem that we would highly recommend! 
1710462,26054531,2015-02-02,25040051,Mitchell,"Everything was perfect from the chocolates on the pillows to the full stocked kitchen and even a wine delivery from your daughter Belle!! (Great wine by the way)<br/><br/>A great way to see the Barossa and we will recommend the studio to all of our friends.<br/> <br/>Thank you for an amazing trip.<br/> <br/>Kind Regards<br/>A very happy customer,<br/>Mitch"
1710462,26589063,2015-02-16,16399411,Johan,"We had a great stay over the Valentines Day weekend. Kylie&Tom were a pleasure to communicate with pleasure and left us to our own devices. The Barossa Valley townships were easily accessible and the apartment was modern, clean and stocked with basics. It was 40 degrees outside but between two air conditioners and a fan, it was fine. Some reviews talk of truck noice from the highway 100m away but I'm a light sleeper and had no troubles at all. Would stay again!!"
1710462,27144564,2015-02-26,8677799,Kate,"Kylie and Tom were very prompt in responding to our requests and even worked out with us to stay an extra night in their gorgeous studio (in the midst of their grapevines).  They have a wonderful eye for design and detail, with nothing was left out that you could need - a range of great teas, and even a couple of buttons in case you lose yours!  We stayed for 3 nights and were glad we did.  The location is perfect for wine tasting throughout the Barossa Valley - and close enough to grocery stores and other amenities.  <br/><br/>A great respite at the end of the day!"
1710462,27321864,2015-03-02,13015952,Scott,We were very happy with our stay at Shea-Oak Log. It was not necessary for us to have face to face contact with Kylie and Tom but we had their contact details if there were any issues. The photos and description are exactly what we found and the details provided prior to our arrival on how to get there and get in etc were very easy to follow. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay!
1710462,27638408,2015-03-09,14580306,Kelly,"The house was really easy to find and in a really nice spot. It was closer to the main highway than I first thought, but that did make exploring the area really lovely. The house was really well decorated and nice and cosy. Perfect for a couple of days. "
1710462,28238198,2015-03-20,9732202,Mia And Joseph,Loved every minute of it. Easy to find situated amongst beautiful vineries. Went for a walk. Very close to all the Barossa has to offer. Great little getaway from Adelaide.
1710462,28488038,2015-03-24,8805125,Jie,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Studio. The Studio was very equipped and has everything we could possibly need. The place is bright, spacious and spotless. I would highly recommend anyone who is planning to visit Barrosa to stay at this studio. The place is perfect for a weekend away or staying for longer. "
1710462,29051945,2015-04-03,26333353,Kimberley,"Had a lovely stay at Shea Oak, easily accessible to the Barossa which was lots of fun. Enjoyed staying amongst the vines. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!"
1710462,29384374,2015-04-07,15578359,Alicia,"they provided very easy instructions, the studio was fully stocked, quick access to highway. There was lots of information on local wineries provided. <br/>Didn't meet Kylie or Tom but knew they were available if needed. <br/><br/>costs about $50 to catch a cab to the nearest town Tanunda<br/><br/>highway could be a little loud BUT it's not a busy highway and it probably only seems loud because the countryside is so quiet! <br/><br/>comfy bed and HEAPS of pillows."
1710462,29577713,2015-04-09,25770204,Kelly,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Studio. The location couldn't be anymore convenient to where we wanted to be in the Barossa. Our hosts had included all the comforts that we would need and made it ideal for making breakfasts easy with their lovely additions in the morning (jams, porridge, coffee, tea). <br/>Will be recommending to any friends who are travelling that way! "
1710462,30020137,2015-04-16,7813972,Brad,The studio was a nice place to see the Barossa. It had everything that we needed and was about 15 minutes from shops of Tanunda. We enjoyed a great wine tour from mark at Barossa cruisin'.
1710462,30185077,2015-04-19,7473198,Kristina,"Kylie and Tom's vineyard shed is the perfect place for a Barossa getaway! Cosy and beautifully modern, with all the comforts and facilities that you could need to relax. Lovely breakfast goodies put out for us, fresh towels and immaculately clean.<br/>The vineyard setting is great, and very easy to find off the main highway. Great brochures and recommendations of what to do and see in the Barossa Valley - all within a 30 minute drive from the Studio shed.<br/>Thank you for a wonderful stay. Will be back!"
1710462,30392816,2015-04-21,28903316,Palash,"The accommodation was neat and clean - everything we expected. Tom and Kylie were superb with their communication. I could see their house - what seemed like 500 metres away - however, the unit we booked was secluded and we felt like we had the vines to ourselves. We dined at Hentley Farm - which was a $40 cab fare. We were able to order pizza delivery for dinner (as we couldn't drive upon our return) - so the shack itself is serviced by everything that is needed. I'd recommend it. Big comfy bed. Tea and breakfast provisions. The barossa on your door step - excellent place to stay and well priced."
1710462,30778334,2015-04-27,15334505,Madeleine,"I did not get to meet the hosts personally, but the place was set up perfectly for us. We arrived late, and they left the lights and heats on for us. It was a great base for us exploring the Barossa. i especially enjoyed the electric blankets and shower!"
1710462,31318859,2015-05-04,29431306,James,"Thank you Kylie & Tom! What a wonderful place you have in the Barossa! Just perfect for a weekend getaway, removed from town but only a short distance to everything you need in the area! Great unique accommodation, hosts & views. "
1710462,32251903,2015-05-16,5216646,Laura,"The studio shed was perfect for our short stay in the Barossa! Easy drive to everything, and the studio itself was very spacious and comfortable. I have already recommended it to friends for their Barossa trips!!"
1710462,32611034,2015-05-19,7295651,Andrea,"To describe that place in one word... WOW... But if you like awesome is fine (Website hidden by Airbnb) a bit isolate, so you need the car, but that's a plus if you are looking for a week end for you and your family/lover. If your arrival is during twilight you will find the light that drives you.. Open the door and you will see how the shed has been set-up for you... You feel like at home... My suggestion is to take with you everything you might need:food and good wine ,from Barossa,of course. You will find all the information to visit Barossa and if you might need something more, text them and they will let you know whatever you after!<br/>Absolutely recommend!!"
1710462,32886614,2015-05-23,25921141,Sophie,We had a great 2 nights stay in this lovely apartment on the vineyard. Very peaceful and a great spot to explore the Barossa from. Very comfortable and would definitely recommend it to friends and family. <br/>Thanks Kylie and Tom
1710462,33228725,2015-05-26,2188730,Thomas,"Clean, comfortable and modern self contained place ten minutes from tanunda. Kylie & tom were lovely hosts and made our stay easy and were even able to accommodate our pug Giuseppe. Being surrounded by all the vines on an operational vineyard was a great way to experience the Barossa. Highly recommended!"
1710462,34538554,2015-06-09,1475985,Kaitlin,We loved staying here. A perfect place to base yourself in the Barossa. I have already recommended it to many friends.
1710462,35243826,2015-06-16,163922,Benedict,Kylie and Tom were great hosts. The place was well setup and made a good base camp to explore the Barossa. We felt very welcome (thanks for providing an infant cot!) and definitely recommend staying here.
1710462,35912120,2015-06-23,12167438,Thomas,"Kylie reached out well before we arrived and ensured the place was ready for us, very good communication. Very good spot and nice and quiet, the unit was exactly as described. Perfect for a weekend getaway in the Barossa."
1710462,36898496,2015-07-02,11139261,Graham,The studio was a fantastic place to stay and explore the Barossa from. Very clean and private with everything you need. Highly recommend it!
1710462,37162918,2015-07-05,7123914,Sonya,"My husband and I really loved our stay at The Studio, it was beautifully laid out and so comfortable. We also loved the horse that came to greet is each morning and night when we returned from a day out. It took us 15-20 minutes to drive wherever we wanted to go in the Barossa Valley and we left feeling totally refreshed. We also loved being able to cook after a few nights on the road."
1710462,38128568,2015-07-13,33636911,Rick,"Cute pleasant place, bed is warm and comfortable and the hot water runs freely.  Hosts were communicative throughout: thanks."
1710462,38496743,2015-07-16,21593129,Lauren,We had a lovely stay at the Shed. It was so homely and comfortable. The location is excellent being close enough to all the wineries. I would recommend the 'shed' to anyone. Very relaxing! 
1710462,40898966,2015-08-03,10955856,Ali,"She-oak Studio was a gorgeous place to stay for our Barossa weekend. A cosy cottage with all the mod cons we needed. Kylie and Tom made sure we were warm and comfy despite out late (and cold!)evening arrival; lights and heater were on for us, and brekkie goodies were left for us too.<br/>Delighted by the horse in the paddock adjacent the studio, who was keen for a pat and to say hello! <br/>Thanks guys!"
1710462,42173532,2015-08-11,36150022,Jill,"What a fantastic experience-Tom and Kylie were utterly lovely to deal with from go-to-woah, nothing was too much trouble. The property was perfect - extremely clean, very affordable, well-stocked with everything we might need and then some, private, plus perfectly located for exploring the beautiful Barossa. We had an absolute blast during our stay, and would highly recommend this home away from home and it's wonderful hosts. Was lovely to meet Vinnie the pony too "
1710462,46036094,2015-09-07,42332381,Laura,We absolutely adored this property! It's in the perfect location to explore the Barossa and was very much a home away from home! Kylie and Tom had thought of all the little details to make our stay comfortable and the views on their property are stunning! 
1710462,47036427,2015-09-15,11087307,Quynh,"If you want privacy and a home away from home, this is where you should stay in the Barossa. With a baby, we were provided with a cot and having a full kitchen allowed us to stay in at night and make dinner. The sunrise every morning was spectacular. "
1710462,47987171,2015-09-22,31636865,Rosmaya,The studio is even lovelier than the pictures. We really enjoyed the stay albeit it's only one night. It's serene and peaceful and yet close to key attractions and wineries. You can even view sunset from the lounge. Kylie and Tom were very kind to allow us to stay for one night only and lots of care had been put in to welcome us. We also had a little surprise on our pillows - individual Tim Tam ;-) and we loved watching your friendly pony. The only regret was we wished we could stay longer. We highly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks.
1710462,49003576,2015-09-30,10859271,Jill,"We had a terrific stay at Kylie & Tom's studio at Shea Oak Log. It was very clean, comfortable and stylish. As we stayed there for 3 nights, we appreciated the full kitchen which was very well equipped and a nice touch with the De Longhi machine and pods.

1710462,52064619,2015-10-26,10496185,Rose,"What a gem in the middle of the Barossa Valley! Only a short drive the vineyards and local restaurants and shops. Kylie and Tom have thought of everything one might need for a stay in the Barossa (i.e. comfortable bed, maps of the Barossa, coffee machine, fully equipped kitchen, winery recommendations, etc). It was lovely to stay on a vineyard (right outside the door), and still have the privacy of a hotel. Highly recommend! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Thank you Kylie and Tom for making our first trip to the Barossa a memorable one."
1710462,52422088,2015-10-29,43821960,Tony,"The Studio was charming and quite off the beaten track, so to speak.  We enjoyed our time there and studio was very well stocked with the essentials.  Good location for pick up for a Barossa wine tour."

I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone intending to head to the Barossa area.

The kitchen had lots of amenities, and the hot water promised lovely hot showers morning and night. The chocolates on our pillow were just the loveliest touch, and their terribly cute pony, Red, would greet us everyday as he stayed in a nearby paddock. The location was very convenient, as it's just a short drive to endless wineries and only about 10 minutes to local shops/restaurants.

It's so picturesque!<br/><br/>The studio had everything we needed for our stay, including an iron for those who, like me, always end up with screwed up clothes in the suitcase!<br/><br/>I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting the area and are looking for a peaceful, relaxing stay.

A comfortable bed, clean and updated kitchen, and convenient parking were all extra pluses. An outstanding, 5/5 stay in the Barossa. Thanks so much, both of you!"

Kylie and Tom have created a self contained studio, perfect for those wishing to wind down quietly after a busy day being a tourist.  It is so private in fact we never even met our hosts but they were only a phone call away had we needed to make contact.<br/><br/>The Studio has a full kitchen should you wish to cook. <br/><br/>Check in and out was really simple - thank you. <br/><br/>Great value for money!"
1710462,120021693,2016-12-07,15332350,Ros,We loved our stay at the Studio in She Oak Log! It was easy to find with the clearly communicated directions given to us by Kylie and Tom. It was a lovely base to explore the Barossa and come 'home' to at the end of the day.
1710462,120491572,2016-12-10,36078685,James,Our stay was comfortable.
1710462,122966792,2016-12-26,32223614,Jitima,"We enjoyed our time there. The host really took effort to ensure that we arrived safely and comfortable. Everything is good and well equipped.  <br/>Overall, this is a very good place and would be perfect if you spend a few days in the area. "
1710462,123352251,2016-12-28,38990392,Xushi,Its was a wonderful stay at the shed.<br/>An unique experience to have . :)<br/>Kylie is a great host.
1710462,123803113,2016-12-30,49383160,Olga,"Whilst the property is located a little further from the main Barossa towns of Tanunda or Angaston, it's very easy to get around, with most places being within 10 mins drive.  It's very close to Gawler, a very pleasant historical town that we really enjoyed.  The cottage has everything one needs for a comfortable stay.  As expected, we paid a little bit of a premium for staying during the Christmas/New Years time.  However, the non-peak rates seem to be an excellent value.  Would definitely consider staying there again. "
1710462,125075530,2017-01-03,34611462,Yvonne,"Instructions to the shed were clear and easy to get to. The space was cosy and comfortable. The noise from the road did not bother us. Although we did not meet Kylie and Tom, communication was very easy and friendly! Great value for money. We would stay there again. "
1710462,126047681,2017-01-08,91240147,Katelyn,Beautiful little studio. Very convent location and had everything you need. 
1710462,126432024,2017-01-11,98499265,Kate,Fantastic communication from hosts! 
1710462,126822543,2017-01-14,108051353,Matthew,"Amazing place to stay, secluded but nothing is too far away. A perfect balance!"
1710462,127621908,2017-01-19,7885092,Michele,"Unique and comfortable and quiet even though it not far from the highway, very good sound proof installation. Very amazed with the interior when the outside looks like a shed but the he interior is homely and welcoming."
1710462,128451343,2017-01-24,41509670,Laura,Perfectly located for exploring all the Barossa has to offer! Great place to stay with everything you will need! Loved the Nespresso machine! 
1710462,128840786,2017-01-27,109952006,John,This is an ideal place to stay when visiting people in Gawler. A nice quite retreat 10 minutes away from Gawler itself to avoid the traffic congestion Gawler seems to suffer from but close enough to be handy for meals etc. Very nice accommodation indeed with everything a traveler could want and more.  This was a great find I will happily stay again and recommend it to freinds.<br/>Cheers John 
1710462,129715592,2017-02-01,96740492,Nina,"Fabulous place so long as one of you will drive after wine tasting or take a tour!! So peaceful, so relaxing & such a great place with all the little creature comforts thought of 👍"
1710462,133335912,2017-02-21,30673138,Melanie,"The studio is very cosy and well equipped. Very close to some great wineries in the Barossa . Kylie and Tom were great hosts, would happily stay here again."
1710462,134549697,2017-02-27,67272998,Amandine,"Good value for money. A lovely self contained studio. A bit of noise from the road however stunning stargazing opportunity, charming livestock, and abundance of privacy. "
1710462,135364385,2017-03-04,23904530,Joanna And Lachlan,"The Studio is gorgeous, comfortable and well located near many of the wineries. We felt right at home but were also in awe of the beautiful location and friendly animals. We were so relaxed and can't wait to come back--would highly recommend! "
1710462,136454698,2017-03-10,72465910,Elaine,"My husband and i stayed in shea oak studio in Feb 2017. The initial thing we noticed was that it wasn't a working vineyard, which we were hoping for as we come from an area in Tasmania with Vineyards all around us, and we knew it was getting close for the Barossa for their harvesting. But the Vineyard is quit rundown. The Studio on first impression was lovley, very clean, and had a few condiments in the fridge, tea , coffee, and a coffee making machine. Surprisingly quiet when the doors were shut, as it is close to the highway, but had not much impact on our stay. Nice touch with chocolates on our bed pillows. Need to be a bit careful in the bathroom when you get out of shower, as the tiles are very slippery, and as the shower door doesn't shut properly, it lets water out on the floor. You cant put the shower rug close to the door as the shower door will not open .  But other than that our stay was quit enjoyable. If we are every back in the Barossa, we would probably be staying in Tanunda, so we are close to restaurants and shops, as it was a little annoying that we has to drive to dinner , but couldn't have a few nice wines together due to driving back to the studio. But is that doesn't bother you, then this is a lovely place to stay, and fantastic value. "
1710462,136662356,2017-03-11,10490141,Megan,We loved our stay at Kylie and Tom's place! Great kitchen that we used to cook dinner with groceries from a nearby store. Perfect stay for our little family!
1710462,137013426,2017-03-12,6311453,Amy,"What a perfect spot to stay amongst the vines in the beautiful Barossa. The perfect size for two people, the converted shed is comfortable and cozy. Although Kylie and Tom weren't there when we visited, Kylie was in touch before our arrival and very easy to contact to organise check in. <br/>If ever we find ourselves back in the Barossa we will be sure to stay again. Thanks again !! "
1710462,138478726,2017-03-19,12748562,Caitlin,"Great apartment, very clean but not located centrally to wineries otherwise it was good. "
1710462,139521613,2017-03-25,24234101,Jennifer,Amazing experience!!! Beautiful place with pretty central location. Kayle and Tom are very attentive and welcome. <br/>Happy to discover this part of Australia! 
1710462,140115279,2017-03-27,120605188,Stela,"Great little studio perfect for a couple to stay very private and close to barossa. We were impressed with all the amenities they thought of everything including foil and gladwrap to pack a lunch for the day, also cooking staples provided like oil salt and even spices. We would stay there again!"
1710462,142172092,2017-04-07,124328906,Lisa,"Sensational bed. Super comfy. Great facilities and little extras. Close to Gawal, Tanunda and Lyndoch. Kylie was warm and welcoming and allowed me to enjoy private use of her gorgeous little place. I'd visit again without any problem."
1710462,142597500,2017-04-08,121615261,Toby,"Super hosts, great communication-perfect for our lunch in the Barossa"
1710462,144928429,2017-04-16,4770762,Eleanor,"Kylie and Tom's studio was a wonderful place to spend a long weekend. It has an extremely well equipped kitchen which was great as we cooked in every night. The open plan kitchen and living was a great space; lovely and bright during the day, and cosy at night. Check in and out was super easy. The location was lovely, there was a little bit of road noise, but nothing to be worried about. It was very easy to reach nearby towns in the Barossa.<br/>Overall it was a great place and we would thoroughly recommend!  "
1710462,145763439,2017-04-19,67184434,Tim,Great value accommodation near the Barossa region.<br/>Lovely little studio to just relax in between checking out the wineries and restaurants of the region.
1710462,146837787,2017-04-23,116187747,Hannah,"Had everything we needed for a few nights in the Barossa. Was easy to drive to all the towns from here- was a tiny further out from what we expected but we are new to the Barossa and it was clear in the description. <br/>Overall exactly what we needed, there was a bit of noise from the highway so if your a light sleeper I'd say bring ear plugs - my husband had no trouble at all though! Barossa is beautiful and well worth a visit!"
1710462,148078547,2017-04-30,29556400,William,Comfy and cozy base from which to explore the Baross
1710462,151236354,2017-05-11,70098691,Alan,"We stayed for a week in early May at Kylie and Tom's studio unit. It is just off the main highway, around half way between Gawler and the main Barossa towns such as Tanunda, Nuriootpa and Angaston and just on the edge of the Barossa Valley. By car , the main areas of interest are still very accessible, being around 10-15 min drive away on very good roads. The unit itself was excellent, especially well set up for self catering (which is what we wanted). The accommodation was very comfortable and good value. We would definitely use this unit again if we were back in the Barossa."
1710462,151671995,2017-05-13,47531335,Jonas,"This cottage was a fantastic base for exploring the Barossa Valley.  We had a hassle free stay with check-in, check-out being straight forward.  Only a 10 minute drive to Gawler for all our necessities."
1710462,154517932,2017-05-25,92861100,Benjamin,"Spent a beautiful three nights in the secluded shea oak log, only a 15 min drive to tanunda and a truly beautiful spot to visit. The space was great and had everything you needed. There was no wifi, but phone reception was great so it didn't matter."
1710462,154957193,2017-05-26,39788700,Kathryn,Loved it. Everything we needed.   Close to McLeod Country. Great place to come back to and relax. I would stay again and re recommend to others 
1710462,155266693,2017-05-28,101803340,Monica,Beautiful well-equipped cottage with lots of extras such as plush linen and travel tips of the area. Can highly recommend it. 
1710462,159872060,2017-06-12,51096850,Sarah,Quiet and private space that's still close to the region's attractions.  This was a perfect base to explore the Barossa. 
1710462,161407310,2017-06-18,1310075,Georgina,Very comfortable and warm - even though it was freezing outside. :)<br/>Would stay here again!
1710462,164037077,2017-06-26,6849761,Sarah & Bernard,"What an amazing bungalow! <br/>We had such an wonderful stay at Kylie and Tom's converted shed. It had absolutely everything we needed. They have done a fantastic job at setting up the place fully equipped with everything you'd need for a weekend away. The kitchen was perfect for cooking in, comfortable bed and a spacious living area. <br/>We were a bit concerned about the location before arriving, however if you have a car, it's no issue at all! Very easy to drive to wineries. Just keep in mind, if you were to get a cab to any of the wineries, it will cost at least $80 return for only a 10 minute drive down the road! <br/>Some reviews suggested a lot of road noice. This was not an issue for us at all and slept peacefully every night. <br/>We will definitely be returning to Shea-Oak Log! <br/>"
1710462,165753174,2017-07-02,6951044,Katia,"Kylie & Tom's place was fabulous - secluded and quiet, but only a short drive from the nearest towns and the best of the Barossa. The unit was clean, spacious and modern, which is to say extremely comfortable - we could have stayed for a week! Absolutely loved it. "
1710462,166907651,2017-07-05,101591125,Sian,"The studio is a beautiful retreat! It was quiet and private, a perfect home away from home. With only a 15 minute drive to basically everything Barossa it was a great base to explore and warm and cozy to return to for the night in the middle of winter. Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job making it immaculate and throughly thought of everything you could need. Definitely recommended!"
1710462,167195693,2017-07-06,7278813,Margie,"Kylie and Tom are excellent hosts and the studio is a beautifully furnished and equipped, private haven. Although it is located quite close to the highway we found that the road noise was not a problem once we were inside the studio. and soon the revegetation planting will be tall enough to muffle it even more. We enjoyed everything about our stay and would highly recommend it."
1710462,168141518,2017-07-09,3582125,John,"Kylie & Tom's place was a great base for us during our stay.  It has everything you'll need, Kylie and Tom are easy to get in touch with and made the whole experience really easy.<br/><br/>Would highly recommend! "
1710462,171160486,2017-07-17,106478224,Caitlin,"Fantastic value and very comfortable accomodation- very close to Barossa and short drive to Gawling, Freeling or Elizabeth. Lots of added extras like suggestions on where to visit, how to get around, undercover parking, lovely linen and covers, electric blankets and great heating options. Thank you for fantastic studio accomodation !"
1710462,172110608,2017-07-20,15789620,Harvey,Well priced for a very comfortable and well supplied apartment. By car it's not too far to Gawler and the Barossa. We especially enjoyed cycling the Barossa Bike Trail- this time from Gawler to Tanunda - a dedicated bitumen track through the beautiful Barossa Valley  (once you've overcome the challenge of finding where it starts).
1710462,173180749,2017-07-23,6737753,Beth,"This was one of the best equipped airbnbs we've ever stayed in! Kitchen had everything we needed to make some tasty meals with produce we bought from the region. Can't recommend enough, very close to all the Barossa has to offer. We didn't meet the hosts but they were very clearly there for us if we needed anything (provided us with a host of phone numbers if necessary). Thanks for a positive experience!"
1710462,175833324,2017-07-30,42006095,Tory,Absolute bliss! We loved our stay at Shea-Oak! Thank you Kylie and Tom!

1710462,178164626,2017-08-05,6312338,Emily,"Kylie and Tom are great hosts! They were super communicative with our check-in and directions, gave us a couple of tips (maps and brochures) and even left a couple lights on for us to find the place as we arrived quite late (11pm). <br/>The place itself has a big and spacious living room, fully equipped kitchen and a super cosy bedroom with the most comfortable bed for relaxing after a day of exploring the Barossa. We only wished we stayed longer!"
1710462,178641161,2017-08-06,140199074,Lachlan,Great little place. Cosy and close to tanunda!
1710462,185563103,2017-08-22,41528318,Melvin,This studio is highly recommended for anyone who wants a base in Barossa valley..! Great place with modern amenities. Check-in was super easy. Couldn't meet Kylie or Tom but they were reachable over the phone.<br/>Would come back anytime.<br/>Thanks Kylie & Tom.
1710462,189846097,2017-09-03,1192737,Wei Ai,"We had a great time at Kylie and Tom's studio. Everything we needed was available in the spacious one-bedroom studio. The bed is very comfortable after a long day wine-tasting, well-equipped kitchen and plenty of maps and brochures to find out things to do in the area. It's conveniently located just off the Sturt Hwy, a short drive to the many wineries of the Barossa. Definitely recommend!"
1710462,191808992,2017-09-09,83605226,Bek,"This was our first time using Air BnB and we weren't sure what to expect. We loved our stay, the studio is just perfect! Great communication and the animals are super cute. Highly recommend and such a bargain!"

1710462,199766240,2017-10-03,138274449,Helen,"The Studio is sparkling as if brand new, yet it is beautifully set up to be intimate and cosy. Its hosts are near but not intrusive. The location is quiet, easy to find and perfect for Heysen Trail walkers or Barossa visitors who have visiting the region's excellent wineries and restaurants and markets on their mind. It is easy to see why many guests intend to stay here again."
1710462,201214059,2017-10-08,147496912,Anthony,We loved the place to the point where we felt like we could live in it long-term.
1710462,202348534,2017-10-11,90549559,Barbara,"Wow! We thought we arrived in a luxury hotel when we entered the studio. Everything you could want or need was there, it was very clean and lovely touches like the chocolate on the pillow just made us feel so welcome. Thank you so much, Kylie and Tom."
1710462,203047346,2017-10-14,46214105,Kristina,"A perfect place to stay! The surrounding views were beautiful, the place itself was cosy and comfortable with everything you'd need. Great value for money and good for visiting the Barossa if you have a car. Thanks so much Kylie and Tom"
1710462,203327374,2017-10-15,2072132,Louise,"We had a great time at the studio! It was perfect for us with a little bubba, and kylie set up a porta cot for us, making out stay extra easy. After leaving a few things at the studio, kylie had very generously offered to post them back to us- we couldn't have asked for better hosts, and it was such a perfect location in the Barossa."
1710462,204392449,2017-10-18,31728464,Chloe,"Kylie and Tom's place was great for a couple of nights in the Barossa, it is fully equipped, but a little way from any main shops/towns such as Tanunda/Lyndoch, but if you have a car it's a beautiful area to drive around.  I didn't meet Kylie or Tom, but received all the info I needed for our stay a couple of days before our arrival, and knew they were just a call away should I need anything else. "
1710462,205330430,2017-10-22,131268812,David,Lovely studio.  Well appointed and close to the wineries. Had a great stay.

1710462,209747461,2017-11-05,81173080,Iain,"Great communication, clean and modern place .  Well equipped for a good price. Only fault I have is the traffic noise."

1710462,212668462,2017-11-18,7029905,Silvia,"Very lovely place to stay! Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job styling and decorating and if we stayed more than one night the kitchen would have come in very handy!  It's in an excellent location for the wineries, and is situated at a nice and private part of the property. An excellent get away! :-)"
1710462,214127346,2017-11-24,138613341,Rebecca,"We stayed at Kylie and Tom's place for three nights. It was a secluded and private building far back from the highway and it provided us with all the comforts at home. It was wonderful for us to be able to collapse on the comfortable couche under the air conditioner after a long hard day sampling the delights of the Barossa. It is a well-located and ideal place to explore the region, and I cannot recommend it enough! Thank you, Nick and Rebecca"
1710462,215144814,2017-11-27,42155496,Cherie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the quiet of rural surrounds (although you do get some muffled traffic noise from the main road) - and enjoyed the space looking out towards the hills, and over the fields etc.  This is actually a one-bedroom place, and was beautifully setup and clean with everything we needed. The nespresso machine was an extra bonus! A very refreshing time there!"
1710462,216007451,2017-12-02,3398589,Robert,Great location less than 10 minutes to amazing wineries and restaurants. Lovely place with wonderful hosts. Highly recommended. Look forward to staying again!
1710462,218749808,2017-12-14,106968577,Zak,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1710462,218968658,2017-12-16,153448289,Anton,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Studio which was very convenient to the places we wanted to visit, especially in and around the Barossa. It offered good standard and comfortable amenity and was great value for money. We will stay again when we next visit SA."
1710462,220775987,2017-12-23,153562066,Meryl,"Private with great amenities. Kylie and Tom were close but left me to myself - just what I needed. Good location for the activities I wanted to do  - an easy drive to the Barossa, Clare Valley and Gawler. And the pony saying 'hello' one morning was a cheerful bonus."
1710462,224688405,2018-01-04,18393551,Kayla-Lynn,"Communication was extremely quick. They left us to our vices, but were available if we needed anything. The place was very tidy and you would never guess that you were staying a shed from the inside. The location was very convenient, but a little noisier than expected due to it's location off a major highway. That being said traffic was very limited during the late hours. Great local suggestions were provided to explore during our stay. Would recommend :)"
1710462,225534301,2018-01-06,17269400,Amy,Perfect location for exploring the Barossa Valley- you’re only 15 mins outside of the main town Tanunda. <br/>This apartment is such great value for money! We were blown away by it. Good communication- Kylie responded promptly to any emails or text messages I sent and were happy to engage with us when we wanted. <br/>I’ll definitely be staying here again on my next visit!
1710462,243989768,2018-03-17,51196874,Angelique,"For a  weekend getaway to the Barossa, Kylie and Tom’s place was perfect. From the reserved location to the quality of the linen and towels, it truly was lovely to be able to rewind at their air bnb after a full day of wining and dining. The folder full of local recommendations was a great touch too!<br/><br/>Thank you!"
1710462,246155823,2018-03-25,42821325,Sandy,Great spot halfway between Barossa and Gawler

1710462,257913702,2018-04-28,26927616,Deborah,"This is an easy place to find and a good location to explore the valley. Kylie and Tom were unobtrusive but there if needed, and responded to our concerns, making us feel welcome. The decor and attention to detail made this place feel like your own. Everything you would need was there and more.<br/>Traffic noise in the quiet of the country could annoy, if you let it, but the comfort of the place far outweighed what some earplugs would provide."
1710462,258257213,2018-04-29,157862729,Cj,Perfectly clean! Quite a bit of highway noise but the glass doors block some of it out. Thanks for having us!

1710462,263806740,2018-05-13,68804067,Lynn,Kylie and Tom’s studio was great for our short stay in the Barossa. <br/>We were very comfortable.<br/>It’s a little out of town but the clear directions given made it easy to find and we loved  being out in the countryside.<br/>We would recommend and would love to stay again.
1710462,266297396,2018-05-20,72251927,Evan,"We had a lovely stay. Tanunda and great wineries all close by, and the Barossa Farmers market. We especially loved our sheep and calf neighbours, they're very friendly and like to say hi through the fence."
1710462,266954178,2018-05-20,23406354,Leith,Take some earplugs if traffic noise bothers you but this is one of the best value and more unique stays I've experienced thru Airbnb. Would love to come again in the future and see how Kylie and Tom have progressed since the bushfire damaged the property. Good luck guys!

1710462,325854005,2018-09-21,56158532,Heidi,Suited our needs as we were waiting for our house to become available as we are moving to the valley.  Loved the outlook and privacy and still close enough to everything. Would be a good place to base yourself if holidaying.
1710462,327983838,2018-09-25,3825195,Randi,Easy check in & pretty close to everything. Great central spot for exploring the Barossa Valley.

1710462,330745663,2018-10-01,8011110,David,"This studio was perfect for an overnight stay, clean, modern and spacious. It's in the middle of a field but the vineyards and towns are just a short drive away."
1710462,332261949,2018-10-05,145465507,Donna,Sheaoak Log Studio is a great little place for exploring the Barossa region.  It is conveniently located just off the Sturt Highway and a short drive to Greenock or Seppeltsfield (about 5 minutes) or a longer drive to Tanunda (about 10 minutes).  You definitely require a car to stay here. The Studio contains a full kitchen which we appreciated. Bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was appreciated.  A great place to stay to explore the Barossa region.  Thank you
1710462,333122532,2018-10-07,169178143,Trish,"Great place, nicely situated but very close to a noisy road."

1710462,339739241,2018-10-22,211097140,Simone,Nice open space on a beautiful property. Comfortable space with everything you need. Kylie and Tom are really welcoming and thoughtful hosts.<br/>Definitely recommended
1710462,346247102,2018-11-08,26839878,Colleen,"Great amenities and space for 2 guests. The kitchen had everything we needed, along with some other unexpected touches. Good location providing you have a car, as it was easier to tour the Barossa Valley.  The only negative thing was that the Sturt Highway ran past the place and it took a bit to get off to sleep. Thankfully I packed some ear plugs. Pillows were the most comfortable I've had yet at an airbnb!"
1710462,346781071,2018-11-09,35679494,Matt,"Great stay and great hosts. Very clean and very cute space. Very handy for touring Barossa valley and great value for money. Great communication. Place is just of the main highway, but set amongst fields and soon to be vines and doesn’t detract from the stay at all."
1710462,347144353,2018-11-11,46347578,Jennifer,"Great, relaxing overnight stay. Clean and thoughtfully presented..even providing plenty of coffee pods. Friendly communication with hosts...thank you Kylie and Tom. Recommended!"

1710462,354448375,2018-12-01,64504803,Lauren,"Kylie & Tom were really responsive and informative. Their place was very private, easy to find and had everything that we needed. We had wine and platter for dinner with local produce and breakfast and had everything we needed. The place was clean and had nice touches like soft towels and couch throws and candles."
1710462,355415193,2018-12-04,41881299,Sandy,"Pleasant stay, spacious surroundings. A bit of noise from traffic yet no big deal. NOTE: There is NO wi fi provided in the cabin which can be a problem as one has to use their own data and not everyone has unlimited data. Cleanliness needs improving."
1710462,356653635,2018-12-09,220472999,Jill,"we experienced a clean, sizeable and well presented accomodation. Everything we needed was there. Well worth it."

1710462,358549238,2018-12-14,10162034,Rachel,"Kylie and Tom’s studio was a perfect oasis following a long day’s walk. Spotlessly clean, with everything I needed for a very relaxing stay. Kylie had even left some extra food provisions for me which was a thoughtful touch. While the studio is on the Sturt Highway, it still feels like a real haven, and I would definitely consider coming back for a few quiet days to myself. I must say the lack of wifi was a real treat - a break from social media can be so refreshing...! Best wishes Kylie and Tom - I hope to visit again some time."
1710462,359467416,2018-12-17,230125727,Avril,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Was a lovely area. Nice clean and spacious accommodation. Quite private also

1710462,362665559,2018-12-26,84805732,Jacki,Lovely place close to Barossa Valley. Has everything you’d need - I wish I’d been able to stay longer than one night! Hosts are quick with communication too which is always a plus. Thanks Kylie/Tom!
1710462,363488910,2018-12-28,23318614,Alisha,"We enjoyed a casual few days staying at Kylie and Tom's place. it was at the start of the Barossa and 15 mins drive from everything. Great space, perfect size, well stocked supplies and great air-conditioning for our super hot days."

1710462,366609443,2019-01-03,53627553,Rebecca,Kylie and Tom’s Studio was the perfect place to stay while exploring the Barossa region. We had everything we could possibly have needed and would highly recommend this space. <br/><br/>Kylie and Tom also mentioned their work on planting new vines around the property - what a treat that will be when finished!
1710462,367448031,2019-01-04,1552865,Chris,"we loved the studio and found it perfectly relaxing for our Barossa visit, great full sized kitchen"
1710462,368445757,2019-01-06,141976526,Chris,A lovely stay just outside the main towns in the Barossa. Excellent value overall.
1710462,401754176,2019-01-15,48444533,James,This is a wonderful place to stay as a base if you are cruising around the Barossa. We had a splendid time in this lovely accommodation.
1710462,405250688,2019-01-26,129383161,Jessica,Beautiful and peaceful accomodation in the Barossa. Great facilities and easy check in and out. Hope to stay again in the future!

Easy to find, just off the highway, with good communication and instructions."
1710462,413005748,2019-02-17,109530299,Teresa,"A great little AIRbnb, stylish accommodation and everything supplied and so close to Adelaide but also a gateway to the winery region.  Very close to Seppeltsfield Winery.  Will be back for a longer stay.  Highly recommended."

1710462,421215159,2019-03-09,101573971,Ann,Lovely country setting so close to Barossa wineries as well as bustling Gawler. Private cabin but our hosts were so prompt when we contacted them.
1710462,422363645,2019-03-11,31632323,Sabrina,Home away from home
1710462,425774223,2019-03-19,247694987,Neil,"Great value, and only a ten-minute drive from the edge of the Barossa. At only 100 metres from the highway, I thought I’d have trouble sleeping, but the noise didn’t bother me. Nicely decorated, though a few little things needed repair. The main problem was cooling down the bedroom. No wi-fi, no washing machine, but overall, not bad."
1710462,429114133,2019-03-27,9154629,Nancy,"Don’t be fooled into thinking Shea-Oak Log is too far away from the town or wineries you want to visit!  Come stay for awhile and enjoy the friendly sheep and calm country ambience.  The space was perfectly clean and tidy, the bed was extra-comfortable and delivered a superb night of rest, and the views of the valley and surrounding hillside couldn’t be lovelier."
1710462,429408198,2019-03-27,105374633,Albert,Clean and stylish but exposed to some traffic noise throughout the night.
1710462,435271258,2019-04-10,128828691,David,"A great rural location, easily located just off the main highway.  An ideal base from which to explore the Barossa valley and surrounding areas."

Short drive to some great restaurants + obviously lots of wineries! Only stayed for a short time in the area but would definitely recommend visiting."
1710462,439356573,2019-04-19,18787124,Paul,A beautiful studio in a beautiful region. We followed the recommendations about some wineries to visit and had some wonderful experiences. Very comfy!

1710462,443382598,2019-04-26,211576747,Anne,"Great place to stay in the Barossa! A little bit out of town but you get to drive into Tanunda which is so picturesque - we enjoyed our space at the studio and not having just a hotel room. Loved having a kitchen so we could make some easy meals after a day of exploring and wine tasting (much better for the wallet!). Great little studio with everything you need, comfy bed and lounge and good bathroom. Also the rainwater drinking tap was amazing. So clean and fresh water, it was delicious! Thanks Kylie and Tom for our stay! We have a fabulous time!"
1710462,444341630,2019-04-27,6953218,Sally,"Kylie & Tom’s place was perfect for us. It was very clean, the bed was comfy & the selection of tea’s was excellent. We were only there for one night, but would be happy to stay longer there. The couch was also very comfy!"

1710462,456218030,2019-05-21,260094696,Alex,Great location for touring the Barossa.  Comfortable and everything you need in the kitchen. Pod coffee machine was a bonus.
1710462,458257506,2019-05-26,261860788,Caitlin,It was a great little get away and their gorgeous sheep were so friendly! It pelted down with rain for the whole trip we were there so we were mainly stuck inside but it was warm and cozy so didnt matter at all :) thanks for a wonderful little get away!
1710462,462218554,2019-06-02,255331803,Elizabeth,"Kylie and Tom are the most hospitable hosts I’ve had the pleasure of meeting anywhere around the world.

1710462,468590392,2019-06-13,21427544,Amanda,"Very conveniently located to the Barossa and surrounds. Couch was particularly comfortable.  <br/><br/>Road noise might be an issue for a light sleeper (occasional truck in the early morning), but I popped on a fan to make 'white noise' and had no problems sleeping. <br/><br/>Given the price it is excellent value!"
1710462,471119307,2019-06-17,76263156,Lauren,"What a lovely spot! <br/>Very private self contained studio room with seperate bed and bathroom. Homely and welcoming, convenient location to the beautiful Barossa Valley. <br/>Thank you for a pleasant stay!"

1710462,487280932,2019-07-14,73509298,Jarrad,"Lovely, friendly couple who made our stay very comfortable with a well presented clean studio. The studio was perfect for what we needed with the 1 bedroom and great range of kitchen utilities and space. Information and instructions for check in were easy to follow and the added messaging support for any troubles was well noted, with Kylie and Tom always happy to help if we needed anything. Great location to explore the barossa and explore some great wineries and lunch locations. Perfect for couples, and would definitely book again if I needed to stay out that way."

We drove 10 min to find some restaurants in Tanunda, but having that nice kitchen was very handy as I was able to prepare some pretty decent and easy meals - as I didn’t want to go for a drive every time I needed food. They provided us with a good supply of coffee, which we loved. <br/>Overall, the place is very clean and tidy. Sofas and bed were super comfortable. Bathroom is quite good too. <br/>It got quite hot in the two days we stayed there, but we were able to manage it with the air conditioners. In the evening the temperature drops quite fast, so we didn’t have trouble sleeping at all - had the fan on."

1710462,738723825,2021-03-13,46337541,Rhys,Great spot for a weekend in the Barossa. We attended a wedding in nearby Freeling so this was super handy for that.
1710462,742539354,2021-03-27,35601646,Tania,"My stay was absolutely perfect. I scored a big 13 hour well needed sleep at the studio before needing to film a wedding the next day. The amenities were just what you needed, especially the heater. The bed was nice and comfy and the shower was exactly what I needed after a long day. But to top it off was the hand raised ewe and her lamb that gave me the best cuddles both mornings in the paddock next to the studio. 10 out of 5 stars for sure."
1710462,743425203,2021-03-29,115724685,Jenny,This place is awesome. Great location and very clean and comfortable.  Tom and Kylie made check in a breeze.
1710462,745879647,2021-04-05,64095927,Vicki,"Huge thank you to Kylie and Tom for welcoming us to the Barossa over Easter. <br/>We had a fantastic first experience with Airbnb messages, as well as communication with Kylie and Tom on the day of our arrival, allowing us to check in to the property prior to the agreed check in time to drop of some perishables to the fridge. <br/>The location was very easy to get to, and felt far enough from the freeway that it wasn’t overly loud or disturbing if the doors and windows were closed. About 15 minutes to pretty much anywhere in the region, including Gawler, was a bonus. <br/>We found some issues with insects and bugs, including an ant infestation in the bathroom which we cleared on our own, so as not to disturb Kylie and Tom. <br/>Would recommend this shed studio for a couple wanting a simple, conveniently located homebase whilst travelling the Barossa region. <br/>Thanks Kylie and Tom."
1710462,747621896,2021-04-11,115748955,Elaine,"It was a pleasure staying at Kylie and Tom’s place! Such a lovey little cabin just off their land, where we could see a few of their barn animals! That was a nice surprise, really loved seeing the sheep! <br/><br/>Located close to Tanunda and surrounding Wineries, the cabin was a perfect place to come back to and unwind after a long day! <br/><br/>Thank you for hosting us!"
1710462,748403245,2021-04-13,16610261,Sarah,Kylie and Tom's place is spacious and comfortable - everything you need for a short stay. A little way out of Tanunda (as described in the listing) but great value for money. Would recommend.

1710462,749671850,2021-04-18,799615,Trevor,"This studio suited our needs perfectly, clean and convenient with room for our racing car! We did not take advantage of its proximity to the Barossa but can see it is a perfect place to stay if that were your priorities."
1710462,751674555,2021-04-25,52362036,Josie,Communication was great from Kylie and Tom and we enjoyed our stay. A great spot to be if you want to explore the Barossa or Gawler.

1710462,753522117,2021-05-01,88866610,James,"Tom and Kylie were very easy to deal with. Made sure we were ok and had everything we needed. Couple of discrepancies in the listing, but nothing too major. Proximity to the Barossa was excellent, and we had no issues with highway traffic noise. Great quality, but would have loved to have seen more care taken in the cleaning of the bedroom."
1710462,755994169,2021-05-08,130198746,Sasha,"Great little studio with everything you need, however traffic noises and vibrations were insanely loud, even with the windows and doors shut. Earplugs are a must."

1710462,770295991,2021-06-13,399015361,Sophie,"A great place for a quick weekend getaway. A good location, with nice views, and easy to find. A quick 15 min drive to anything you need. Kylie and Tom had good communication when we needed. We had a great time visiting the Barossa and using Airbnb for the first time."
1710462,390148911408367491,2021-06-22,93982622,Kit,Really excellent picturesque little spot. Kylie and Tom were very helpful and communicative and the stay was clean and well presented with lots of utilities.
1710462,401010823718591433,2021-07-07,317939867,Scott,"Cozy and private accomodation well positioned to access all of the Barossa's attractions. The Studio is extremely well equipped, clean and comfortable."
1710462,403109644068972351,2021-07-10,150062400,Emma,"The studio was great, very well equiped and easy to find. Check in was very easy and Kylie and Tom were very helpful when we had to reschedule. The studio doesn’t have any wifi though, which I overlooked when booking. Otherwise a great apartment, close to the Barossa in a lovely spot."
1710462,408250955777874874,2021-07-17,253202169,Kym,"A comfortable, clean and isolated studio close to the wineries, cafes and hiking tracks. We would stay here again!"
1710462,408880511046076398,2021-07-17,19024949,Zach,Cosy spot for a weekend away. Great communication from the owners.
1710462,418387865972739229,2021-07-31,1811511,Michael,Very convenient and comfortable accommodation. Close to the main highway and within easy reach of anywhere in the Barossa.
1710462,429931581996714884,2021-08-16,9348650,Karin,"I stayed at Sheoak Log Studio for quite a few days as I was attending an art workshop in Kapunda, about 20 minutes drive away.<br/><br/>It has everything one needs for a self-contained stay, it is in a good location and is fantastic value for the area. <br/>Kylie and Tom valued my privacy which is always a bonus.<br/><br/>On the downside, I was a little disappointed by the description of the location of the studio as it is on the edge of broadacre farming of Canola fields or similar, and doesn't seem to be related to vineyards even though there are about 12 vines in the garden.  The Wine areas are from about 10 km's away.<br/><br/>Maybe my misinterpretation was that I had envisaged a studio in a Sheoak forest on the edge of a vineyard. Also there is a major highway about 100 metres from the studio with constant trucks and vehicle noise whizzing past. It didnt bother me as I still slept well but I was surprised that it was right there as the garden view. All in all, I had a fab stay for what I needed and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend the studio."
1710462,434987019696592430,2021-08-23,412370102,Liam,"Great place to stay! Used it as a place to sleeping during the Medieval Fair in Lyndoch. Nice little kitchen with all the essentials and plenty of heating options for the cold weather. Everything was very clean and tidy. Lovely view of the sunrise. Lots of privacy, check in and out was completely contactless and really easy. <br/><br/>Highway noise was noticeable at night but didn't disturb me, and I'm a fairly light sleeper. With some music or the TV running you won't hear it at all."
1710462,439355714384926863,2021-08-29,123541824,Hadyn,Great location for the event we had booked for the weekend. Recommend taking your enough food supplies for your stay as the supermarket is not just down the road. Was nice and warm in winter. Only big enough for a couple. Hosts very nice and more than happy to help. Well priced.
1710462,453151045482416676,2021-09-17,168805218,Sarah,Convenient base to explore the Barossa. Very comfy & clean. The studio shed had everything we needed for our 4 night stay.
1710462,459631515915268157,2021-09-26,174087062,Karen,"What a lovely, homey, modern, light-filled place to stay. So peaceful and relaxing amongst the fields and sheep/horses. And I loved the blossom trees so much!!"
1710462,462631392395415106,2021-09-30,361744407,Georgia,"Kylie and Toms studio was a perfect place to relax, and their communication with us was excellent. The studio was bigger than I expected and it was lovely and clean! Only a 10 minute drive from Tanunda. Would definitely stay again!"
1710462,473467232973668399,2021-10-15,263408914,Sarah,"great location,and great communication"
1710462,490059378157695000,2021-11-06,78991916,Ingrid,We enjoyed staying at The Shed which was scrupulously clean and functional. The kitchen/fridge was stocked with handy items including various sauces and some breakfast makings. It was more spacious than anticipated and attractively furnished with some interesting handmade items of decor. We were impressed with Kylie's quick responses to messages and the assistance provided to operate the oven (it needed resetting after a recent power loss). <br/>The bed was super comfortable. <br/>We also enjoyed meeting the sheep in the paddock next door and they seemed to enjoy meeting us :)
1710462,495157822144455395,2021-11-13,293528135,Annette,Thank you for a lovely comfortable stay
1710462,500279452084289209,2021-11-21,93415216,Karen,"Great communication. Great location for touring around the area. You can hear the road noise, but not when inside and listening to music. Comfortable and well equipped."
1710462,505338911473719725,2021-11-28,38201604,Kerryn,"Lovely simple, comfortable accommodation in a great location for exploring the Barossa. Kylie and Tom are accommodating and communicate well from beginning to end"

1710462,514771519557264148,2021-12-11,415432287,Tayla,The studio was perfect for a one night stay in the Barossa.

1787389,58884569,2016-01-05,12017568,Kate,"We stayed here for 3 nights as two adults couples. This is a great apartment just off the Main Street of Tanunda. It is well appointed and clean with access to a laundry and pool which is great. The kitchen was perfect for light dinners, after big lunches in the region. <br/>Communication and checking in and out were easy. <br/>The only thing I would say, is that for international travelers, the lack of free wifi ($10/day instead) may be a drawback. Being from Australia we could use our own internet, but it seems like something that could be easily fixed. <br/>We would definitely stay again. "
1787389,60566666,2016-01-25,2408520,John,"What a lovely place to stay, the apartment was & loooked better than the online photos. The location was perfect, it was clean and well appointed. The only negative for me was that for the price I think the pillows could have been better. I would stay here again. <br/>Thank you Kym. "
1787389,62584076,2016-02-15,18795783,Helen,"This is a great apartment, spacious and well maintained. <br/>I would say they only thing lacking is WIFI.<br/>Very good location for exploring the Barossa. "

1787389,70853669,2016-04-21,15816038,Carol,"Tanunda and Barossa Valley are so very lovely, especially the people.   So warm and welcoming, to be sure.  <br/><br/>Our rental was situated in a prime location, downtown Tanunda.  The check-in process was easy, always a plus.<br/><br/>I would recommend the Valley Apartments for a stay in the Barossa."
1787389,80152078,2016-06-16,12487731,Marina,"Very efficient process in order to obtain the key. <br/>Lovely, clean and modern apartments very central to the main street.<br/>Absolutely loved them and we would definitely stay there again. Thank you "
1787389,90569749,2016-08-01,12852497,Samantha,"The apartment was spacious, clean and well equipped. There were fresh towels and sheets and hotel-like toiletries. Kim was helpful and quick to respond to our needs. <br/><br/>The apartment would have been better if there was a little bit more entertainment such as a selection of DVDs, an Apple TV (or equivalent) and some cards or board games. "
1787389,100151415,2016-09-07,11711933,Nicole,"Fantastic, clean apartment in a fabulous location! Nice and private off the Main Street. Will definitely stay again! "

1787389,184495468,2017-08-20,74221284,James,Great location and warm modern unit. Would stay their again
1787389,199757450,2017-10-03,117252826,Michael,Was a nice comfortable place to stay. Only two of us stayed so Apartment was too big but none the less was nice. I believe the apartment was a little bit over priced but that's just personal preference. 
1787389,202112322,2017-10-10,74753265,Rick,Great apartment

1787389,713185962,2020-12-04,22748111,Erin,"Great location, very easy to walk to restaurants and shops. Booking and check in process was very easy. Accomodation was clean. Unfortunately it was very overpriced. $500 for one night on a Thursday in early December. It felt like boutique accomodation prices for a motel feel experience."
2327616,26704447,2015-02-17,26937232,Inam,"We enjoyed our stay, beautiful quiet farm house. "
2327616,29336940,2015-04-06,29769094,Warren,"Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations.  Our hosts were extremely friendly, hospitable and informative.  Bill even took us out to help feed the sheep on his farm!  If you're looking to stay on a peaceful farm in a homely granny flat that is just a short drive from Adelaide and Barossa Valley, Bill's place is perfect.       "
2327616,30841121,2015-04-27,27717042,Andy,Bill and Angela made us feel very welcome and were accommodating of an unexpectedly late arrival. The bungalow was comfortable and cosy and set in the midst of their large farm but close to Gawler. We enjoyed our stay.
2327616,37149302,2015-07-05,1089693,Dong,"Bill and Angela are very nice and prepared all the things we need, with sunny smile and local knowledge.<br/><br/>The whole family enjoyed the quiet farm, sighting the new lambs being born, sunrise. <br/><br/>Great experience and thanks a lot!"
2327616,43322471,2015-08-18,9495634,Celeste,"The kindest people. Angela made sure we settled in warmly. Bill took time off work on his farm to plan our day trip. We had the honour of meeting their friends too. One of the good fellows even followed up with an itinerary for our trip to KI. <br/><br/>(The sweetest dogs too. Millie came to sit with us often. Max was always ready to play.)    <br/><br/>The property sits within an hour from Adelaide CBD and Gawler Town, and approximately two hours to Cape Jervis (if you're heading over to KI). You will need a car and to drive on unsurfaced road to reach the farm. (Website hidden by Airbnb) The room with ensuite bathroom is fitted with a very comfortable queen bed (with electric blanket), one extra single bed, heater in both rooms, television and fridge. There were also bread, cereal, juice and milk, on top of cutlery and dishware. <br/><br/>I would say the pictures are an understatement of how beautiful the property is, especially with the view outside. You will also wake up to the sheep bleating and birds chirping. The perfect getaway with wonderful hosts."
2327616,46649544,2015-09-12,43058481,Suzanne,A pleasant stay on a working farm the highlight of which was the opportunity to see a shearer in action.
2327616,48735343,2015-09-28,42234441,Catherine,"A warm and welcoming couple that we enjoyed chatting with.<br/><br/>A very pleasant little slice of country life, with all care taken to provide homely comforts."
2327616,55254916,2015-11-29,45178332,Will,"What a truly wonderful and relaxing experience! Bill and Angela are both delightful, the views are stunning and  Bills homemade bread in the morning just topped it off. Will definitely be back!"
2327616,58126122,2016-01-01,16888654,Denis,"Hosts Bill and Angela are congenial hosts making us most welcome on arrival and providing helpful advice in advance.<br/>Our nine night stay, covering the final week of December, was very comfortable even with the seasonally high temps.  As listed, the unit is well appointed. The unit and it's outside seating make for a most relaxing view of an attractive ornamental garden and views extending across the fields to the hills of the nearby Barossa.<br/>It is only a short distance of unsealed road to access the property and the reward of experiencing the comforts and hospitality offered are well worth a return visit.<br/>"
2327616,61935743,2016-02-09,28337268,Julie,"Bill and Angela ( and wonder dog Max!) were fabulous hosts we arrived in time to watch some of the shearing of their stud sheep and were then shown through our self sufficient accomodation adjacent to the house in a lovely garden aspect. We had heard all about Bills home made bread from previous vistor reviews and weren't disappointed every morning a couple of large thick slices were waiting for us in the fridge, along with, jam, fresh orange juice, milk and a selection of cereals plus tea and coffee. The location was perfect for us a short drive across the main highway to Gawler and our family we came to visit but quiet enough for us who usually live in the country. Highly recommend and look forward to staying again when we next return to SA. "
2327616,74057490,2016-05-12,5901211,Maree,"Bill and Angela welcomed us warmly. Angela pointed out the location of the food and amenities that they had provided for our breakfasts. As it was late and the shops closed she suggested a local tavern where we could  get some dinner. We really appreciated Angela's advice. Bill was very busy with lambing but took time out to talk with us and explain the operations of the farm. Our flat was very cosy, clean and comfortable. We really felt ""at home""and would love to return some time. Bill's bread made for nice crispy toast!! We really enjoyed being in a country farm environment. Thanks Angela and Bill."
2327616,79067614,2016-06-11,11594164,Ip Na,"Angel and bill were so nice , we had a perfect dinner , share our story and country curtlure , we were really enjoyable , beautiful house , beautiful view ! I think I will never forget this day , thanks so much ! Hope can see u guys in somewhere again ! "
2327616,79442755,2016-06-12,64821446,Kylie,"Bill and angela are just good  decent country people that would take the shirt off their backs for you. My visit was short but amazing, they feed me at short notice after the weather turn rather horrible as i was heading out  but decided not to. Bills bread that he cooks fresh for breakfast is amazing. Wish i had more time to spend with them and would of loved to see more of there beautiful property. If im ever in the area again i would be staying with them with out a doubt. Thanks again for my lovely stay."
2327616,90807021,2016-08-02,15321985,Laura,"Thankyou Bill and Angela for being so accomodating. I had a lovely, short stay- wish it was longer! The space was clean, bed was super comfortable and there was lots of goodies provided. <br/>Thankyou once again for a good, carefree stay. "
2327616,106928887,2016-10-08,96651769,Karen,I am glad that I found this property and met Bill and Angela.  They made my weekend of having to work locally much more bearable.  Very welcoming and comfortable place to stay.  I hope to be back again and bring hubby with me next time for a longer stay.  Even the family dog made me feel very welcome.
2327616,124835118,2017-01-02,9126247,Kevin,"We really enjoyed our stay on the farm and Bill and Angela were excellent hosts.  They were very friendly and helpful, ensuring we enjoyed our stay.  We would really recommend this accommodation for anyone wanting a quiet country escape.  Max the dog was a real plus!"
2327616,126063428,2017-01-08,78406518,Debbie,We bad a lovely stay at Bill and Angela's. Angela was very obliging when we needed a couple of things. Thanks Bill and Angela for your hospitality. 
2327616,126831882,2017-01-14,74573435,Joel,"Had a great stay, very comfortable and clean. Hosts both very accommodating and friendly"
2327616,145568301,2017-04-18,22390318,Jessica,"Bill and Angela are exceptional hosts. They made us feel at home and looked after us well. I'm a single dad with primary school age children who love farms and animals. Bill let us join in all his farm work and he was brilliant with the kids - so patient and inclusive.  We visited in time for the start of the lambing season. Bottle feeding lambs was a treat for the kids. <br/>The farm is absolutely beautiful. We were lucky enough to see a lot of the land and some of the old buildings made of local materials. <br/>Comfortable beds and quality linen had us sleeping well after our days of fun, fresh air and exercise. The cottage is very clean and was freshly painted before our visit. <br/>Finding the farm was easy. Bill's directions are accurate and the address is easy to find on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps also. <br/>We will be back for sure. "
2327616,147832333,2017-04-28,68589494,Kerry,"This place is a real get-away from everything, very relaxing and super friendly hosts. Especially good if you want to experience some farm-life. Nice B&B style, and not too far to drive for dinner etc. "
2327616,179594163,2017-08-08,22390318,Jessica,This was my second visit with my kids. We loved our first visit so much the kids were begging me to go back. This place is so pretty in the winter when it's all green. Bill and Angela are wonderful hosts and made us feel very welcome once again.  
2327616,213128057,2017-11-19,102785054,Andy,Great self contained room - brought my own food which I didn't have to as there was breakfast laid on every day which I didn't use.
2327616,215819268,2017-12-01,34500288,Daisy ( Thuy),"Bill’s place was just magnificent, you get the idea of peace and serenity immediately you arrive, we will be looking forward to another stay in future."
2327616,217329726,2017-12-08,21545893,John,"Bill and Angela are fantastic hosts; they are friendly and hospitable and I found the farming operation very interesting. They look after you well with home-baked bread and condiments, and are very happy to share their local knowledge. The cottage is very comfortable with lovely views out across the countryside, and a very pleasant outdoor patio to enjoy ""sundowners"" and snacks in the evening. The trip into the northern parts of Adelaide is quick and convenient (approx 30 mins). The proximity to the Barossa is an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb."
2327616,224691403,2018-01-04,125948660,Caitlin,Small space but perfect for 2-3 people. About 30 mins from Tanunda (main town of the Barossa Valley). They have kettle and tea/coffee but no microwave or kitchen amenities. Hosts are wonderful and very friendly and helpful :) the accommodation is on their farm next to their house but still feels private.
2327616,236317464,2018-02-19,21910251,Chantelle,We really enjoyed the location and beautiful surroundings of the property. The apartment is small but cosy. The proximity to the main house is very close but we happened to stay while the owners were away which made it very quiet and private. Unfortunately the wifi only worked for the first night and then would not work again. Also the apartment was quite dusty and had cobweb corners. But everything else was clean and tidy. The continental breakfast provided was very nice and it was nice to have our dishes cleaned up for us each day. Overall we did enjoy our stay and found it comfortable.
2327616,237672007,2018-02-23,135431348,Jacob,Great little space with beautiful views and beautiful hosts.
2327616,239702256,2018-03-02,95956096,Carla,"Bill and Angela’s hospitality was outstanding, they helped us during the stress of moving house. Their beautiful home has helped us de-stress and relax during this crazy time, fresh bread everyday and a little tour of the farm made our stay extra special."
2327616,243997510,2018-03-17,97857527,Rowena,Great location to explore the mid North from. Very friendly hosts and generous continental breakfast.
2327616,249295021,2018-04-02,79411860,Patsy,"We had an excellent experience staying at Bill's place. The place was very relaxing and provided my husband and myself a much needed break. His two dogs provided excellent pet therapy! Bill & his wife were very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions for places to eat, things to do etc. The daily provision of freshly baked bread was just the icing on the cake! We look forward to staying here again when we visit next."
2327616,254152074,2018-04-15,159127277,Sindy,So comfortable and great views

2327616,333128440,2018-10-07,95079074,Peter,If you are staying in Angle Vale is it very close to shops and entertainment . I do recommend it.

2327616,358844749,2018-12-15,230534370,Luqman,"Great experience for a recharge. Very clean and tidy place. Max the sheep-dog is addicted to a tummy rub, so be ready to give some love and receive some."
2327616,363496317,2018-12-28,229492009,Sukitti,We had a wonderful time staying at Bill's place. We especially loved the farm tour. It was amazing! We learned a lot about sheep and farming. The room was great as well. Space greatly used. Perfect for a family or a group of friends. Super comfy beds and the shower pressure is outstanding! It definitely felt like a home away from home. And the surroundings are beautiful. Bill and Angela were such warm and welcoming host. Thank you!
2327616,367016964,2019-01-03,181401066,Wendy,"Bill's place is a lovely quiet space right next to his home but overlooking the patio, grape arbour and distant hills. Bill welcomed our young son to feed the sheep which was special. We really looked forward to going 'home' to the farm after long touristy days."
2327616,400063080,2019-01-10,29293106,Maria,"We booked this accommodation for two of our workers who needed to complete a job in the area.  The location was excellent and as far as I can ascertain, all went without a hitch with the booking.  There were no complaints from our guys and the accommodation worked out well."
2327616,400388786,2019-01-12,130962324,Isha,Excellent spot for star gazing!!!
2327616,401517794,2019-01-14,144369792,Tracy,"A cute little place with outstanding hospitality, and an excellent taste of farm life. Close enough to explore around the Barossa Valley by car. I would definitely recommend a stay with Bill & Angela."
2327616,402922463,2019-01-20,30952964,Dayna,"We stayed for 2 nights at Bill and Angela’s. My daughter said the best holiday ever and must stay place at Adelaide. Really loved farm staying, appreciated Bill and Angela’s great hospitality. hopefully we visit you sometime soon!"
2327616,408611040,2019-02-04,195775173,Brenda,Love the country setting. It was peaceful and would definitely go back if I am in the area. The host were very generous!!

2327616,415117543,2019-02-21,243046165,Monique,"Bill, Angela and family are fantastic hosts. They are extremely welcoming, they offer local knowledge and are great to talk to. The country home is clean, welcoming, spacious and has a real country touch to it. As an animal person I loved being able to play with the dogs each night when I got home. I would definitely recommend staying at Bill and Angela’s."
2327616,420822960,2019-03-07,39554467,Ken,"We really enjoyed staying in the guest cabin, with Bill and Angela as our hosts. They could not have been better hosts, providing us with an experience well above our expectations.<br/>We were particularly pleased with the help Bill and Angela provided with an unexpected complication. Nothing was too much trouble.  given the property was a very busy working farm, Bill was only too happy to explain how the property operated and it has given us a more informed view of farm life in Australia.<br/><br/>We will happily seek to stay here again when visiting SA.<br/><br/>An added bonus is the two dogs we got to play with, Max and Rosi.  We thought about taking Max home with us but decided Max would miss being a sheepdog.  Bill told us that Max thinks he's a sheep dog but he's not very good at it.  Nevertheless , it was fun to see Max jump onto the hay ute each morning, chase the sheep and think he's doing a great job.  And Rosie is just a little sweetie who likes a bit of attention.<br/><br/>We would recommend this stay to anybody who seeks a totally different AirBnB experience in SA.<br/><br/>And the bread Bill makes each day for breakfast is simply the best toast we have ever had."
2327616,439883908,2019-04-20,253545329,Peter,"The thoughtfulness, kindness, generosity and hospitality was amazing. Beautiful location, lovely accomodation and the going above and beyond was heart warming. Bill and Angela , thank you so much for a lovely experience."

2327616,447026549,2019-05-03,39554467,Ken,"Bill and Angela are great hosts. Nothing is too much trouble. An added benefit is that the property is a substantial working sheep farm. So quiet, yet located very close to the famous Barossa Valley where there is no end of interesting places to visit.  This is our second stay with Bill and Angela and we will not hesitate to stay again when next in the area."

2327616,607859608,2020-02-19,96651769,Karen,"A return stay for me and once again I had a lovely stay with such a welcoming family.  It feels like a home away from home and even though my stay was for work-related purposes again, it didn't take long to relax and unwind in a comfortable farm setting.  Seeing Max the Border Collie again and newborn triplet lambs a highlight!"
2327616,616563267,2020-03-10,95983801,Maree,Bill's place is about 10 minutes out of Gawler so is handy to all amenities.   We loved staying on a working farm and the farm tour was a highlight.  Bill's home baked bread was also a highlight for us.  Yum!
2327616,618244730,2020-03-15,3482640,Vadim,"Doors / window overlooks to east and you can enjoy sunrise right from your bed.<br/>Bill has 2 grandkids and thus a lot of scooters, bikes, toys you can use, so our 2 kids were happy to play.<br/>Bill showed around his farm, told about its history, how things are done - that was interesting and I got what I was hoping for.<br/><br/>In reality stains on carpet and white cover spoiled first impression.<br/>This is a guesthouse with a metallic roof, as in garage. <br/>Spider webs in some corners. Different type of bugs notices in the house and one in bed.<br/>Bed was way too soft for me. First morning was harsh after such bed, second one was ok, as I slept only on my back.<br/>No wifi signal in the guesthouse or even on a patio by it. Had to use my mobile as a hotspot. <br/><br/>Comparatively, it was far from worth of $290 for 2 nights (because of the cleaning fee $30 and Airbnb commission). However, $90 is a good price."
2327616,628077774,2020-06-07,183082528,Mina,"Bill's place was so nice. The place wasn't not only for staying, the whole area was amazing wildpark. I feel. Guests can be experienced real farm life such as feeding lambs.<br/>I was so happy to stay there."

We loved the very generous & specific breakfast supplies for our dietary requirements  & you accomodating our baby with a high chair & cot was very handy.

2327616,703445643,2020-10-25,372360608,Nicki,"A hidden little gem, we only wish we could have stayed longer. The view is amazing, it was lovely to lay in bed and look out over the fields and the sheep ‘alarm clocks’ were nice to wake up to. <br/><br/>We were welcomed and made to feel at home straight away. The accommodation was perfect for us and had everything we needed. They may just have one of the the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in.<br/><br/>My 10 year old loved the games and movies. He’s already asking when we can go back.<br/><br/>Perfect location for us, close to family and we will be repeat visitors."

The time we did have there however, was wonderful. Check in was super easy and it was lovely to fall asleep to the sheep and the lambs. It was also great that we didn't have to worry about breakfast as it was supplied and delicious. We would love to stay again next competition."
2327616,755249106,2021-05-05,397479749,Craig,"our stay at the sheep farm was amazing. Our timing couldn’t be better as it was lambing time, and our hosts were accommodating and allowed us to get as involved as we wanted. We could not recommend this any higher to those looking for a true farm stay."

Accomm has everything required and provides a relaxing space. Breakfast supplies also a plus<br/>Felt more remote than it actually is - a bit of a gem considering the location and proximity to ADL. <br/>A very enjoyable way to end the week for us."

We received a warm welcome and great hospitality with a well stocked fridge and provisions, even down to home made bread . If one wants to combine a true getaway and authentic experience in the Barossa this is your answer.<br/>"

In the evening you are treated to Kangaroos just outside your door, in the morning Rebecca has all of the fixings for a wonderful farm-fresh breakfast. <br/><br/>The cottage is wonderfully restored, and beautifully decorated.

Upon being greeted by Rebecca when my partner and I walked into the cottage we instantly said the photos don't do it justice. Even though on the website it's a beautiful cottage the warmth and the atmosphere was amazing. <br/><br/>We were greeted with decanted port, fresh eggs, chocolates, breakfast, candles, we made our own bread and enjoyed an amazing open fire place. Highly recommended and Rebecca was a great host whenever we needed. Will be staying again for sure. "

We really enjoyed our stay, it was so comfortable and was a great couple of days of relaxation. Rebecca was a fantastic host, very accomodating and thought of every little detail.

We would definitely recommend the cottage to others and believe rooms such as the bathroom looked better than the photos.<br/>Great work Rebecca and family."
2567051,103694091,2016-09-23,7309519,Lis,"The cottage was beyond expectations and absolutely gorgeous. The milky way shone brightly at night, the garden grounds and birds chirped cheerily at the back, the comfortable bed was a refuge for dreams and the gorgeous bath a relaxation space in the warm bathroom.

And, pet friendly on top of all that!!<br/><br/>Breakfast came with fruit, yogurt, cereal, bacon and more. High end bathroom amenities, plush comfy bed and a beautiful, peaceful setting. Great place to getaway and de-stress. <br/><br/>The only suggest I would make to future guests is to use plenty of bug repellent as there are lots of mosquitoes. (Rebecca does provide bug repellent though).<br/><br/>All in all, there isn’t much else I could have asked for."

Breakfast was plentiful and there was even a bread maker in the barn kitchen to whip up a loaf for the morning. Kangaroos grazing out the front and nothing but birdsong to disturb the peace. A lovely break!"
5289072,52133158,2015-10-26,25080800,Niusha,"A spacious house set on a hill overlooking the valleys and majestic gums. Perfect base to explore the hills, we stayed with 5 of us, 2 couples and a single, and it was ideal for us.<br/>Well appointed throughout, comfortable beds, we'll be back."
5289072,54019796,2015-11-15,19433775,Kae,"My family and I (5 people) had an awesome time up at this residence. It was the true Barossa experience we were wanting... being in the middle of nowhere with all the scenery!<br/>Phillip was very hospitable even before we got there and made sure we were comfortable throughout the whole stay.<br/>We had the whole place to ourselves and it was truly relaxing. We would sleep to the sounds of the sheep, and wake up to the birds chirping.<br/>The house had everything we needed plus more... plenty of space!<br/>We definitely know where we'll stay again when we return to the Barossa.<br/>This place is highly recomended. "
5289072,63350554,2016-02-22,5396634,Jo,"My family and I (5 of us) had such a great time staying in the Barossa at Phil's place! Phil met us at the house and quickly showed us around, and pointed us in the direction of some travel guides which had recommendations of the area. <br/><br/>The house was well equipped with everything you need for preparing a meal with everything you pick up at the nearby Farmer's Markets. The rooms were comfortable and there was plenty of space for everyone. We would definitely go back!<br/><br/>No drawbacks at all, but given the location if you're staying here you'll definitely want a car. We booked knowing this, and made plenty of use of my parent's car. That said - there are lots of wine tour guides that will pick you up too :) "
5289072,64358185,2016-03-03,53360034,Adrian,"We enjoyed our stay immensely, the property was clean and suited our needs. Phil was super helpful and very welcoming. Would recommend as a great base for exploring the barossa."
5289072,67411095,2016-03-29,53918241,Jules,"The house was perfectly equipped for us and Phil was very helpful. It was a great location being a bit off track for quiet times in the countryside and then to head in wine tasting. Great value for money, thoroughly enjoyed our visit. "
5289072,67880938,2016-04-01,57488252,Lily,"My friends and I stayed at this beautiful property for a bit of R&R during our Dragon Boat racing. It was exactly what we expected, nice quiet retreat to get away from it all but very handy to explore the wineries in this region. One of my friends accidentally left a bag of clothes behind and Phillip was kind enough to bring it back to him in the city. Wonderful place to stay, loads of room, everything you would need or want."
5289072,69123378,2016-04-09,63681255,Stefan,"Our final day at Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm summed up our experience = NO ONE WANTED TO LEAVE!!! We were all too comfortable, too relaxed, & too 'at home'. Having the whole home to ourselves (4 people) was a spacious treat. Everything was available for use (bathroom & kitchen) - we really didn't need to bring anything along in advance. The isolated & rustic environment transpired into a peaceful & tranquil existence after each day's hard work sampling wine, cheese & treats in the Eden & Barossa Valleys! Very pleased we stayed here, rather than on a main road or in a busier urban area. The property caters for all ages & would be ideal for a family - sheep, kangaroos, abundance of bird life & I even thought I saw a rabbit! Highly recommended."
5289072,70755471,2016-04-20,11219021,Ruth,"Thankyou very much for a lovely stay in your spacious home.<br/>We loved the extensive views, sense of isolation, prolific birdlife and proximity to the Lavender Federation Trail (our aim of completing the Springton to Truro section was easily met).<br/><br/>The house was clean, comfortable, and very generously supplied with everything one could possibly need/want.<br/><br/>It was lovely to meet Mary (and discover we had been fellow walkers many many years ago!)<br/><br/>"
5289072,71467687,2016-04-25,1623747,Sue,Phillip and his wife met us on arrival abs showed us around the house. They made us feel very welcome and the house was lovely. Plenty of space which was great with 6 of us sharing. The surrounds were peaceful but not too far from anywhere in the Barossa. The bird life in particular was a delight for me. We would definitely stay again.
5289072,71727791,2016-04-28,11530317,Natasha & Michael,"Despite our late arrival, Mary was gracious enough to wait for us patiently and provide us with helpful information about the location. The property is beautiful and the home is welcoming, spacious and well looked after. "
5289072,72185675,2016-05-01,65995774,Penny,"This beautiful Mt McKenzie property is the perfect retreat - spacious rooms with plenty of natural light, modern kitchen and bathrooms, comfortable beds, outdoor seating areas to enjoy the sunshine and an incredible view. Phil is very helpful and welcoming. It's an easy drive to Barossa towns and wineries. My friends and I loved our stay and left feeling refreshed and relaxed. We highly recommend this property."

5289072,81519948,2016-06-23,17622932,Shannon,"We loved our time at the Mt Mckenzie raspberry farm. Phillip was very easy to communicate with and friendly. He greeted us on arrival, was very welcoming and introduced us to what we needed to know about the log cabin. The pictures are an understatement to the beauty that surrounds this property and we were happy to share the experience with the wildlife. Apart from this, the cabin is well equipped with everything you need. Excellent fire and a homely feel! The nearest town Angaston is also a treat and only ten minutes down the road with nice restaurants, a grocery store and a the famous Barossa cheese company shop. A relaxing getaway in a beautiful region! Thanks again Phillip! Much appreciated! :)"
5289072,82998151,2016-06-30,67290287,Scott,"We were met by Mary, who did an excellent job of telling us about the place and the surrounding areas including some great wineries.<br/><br/>The place was tidy and clean and well equipped. It is very large and comfortable. As the pictures show, it's in a beautiful setting."
5289072,86291619,2016-07-15,57681208,Ingrid,Phil was there to greet us when we arrived and helped us via a phone call when we got lost! He had the fire going and gave us some helpful advice about some of the local wineries

The property is wonderful; beautiful views and very comfortable, so much so that we felt no need to leave during our stay...and we probably wouldn't have, had the attractions of the Barossa not been so accessible. We will definitely return!"
5289072,95667019,2016-08-20,30737133,Han,Phil was very friendly and prompt in all his communications. The place was exactly as is in the pictures!  views and surrounds were beautiful. Gorgeous property and a very good price for the Barossa. Wouldn't definite stay here again!

5289072,101155766,2016-09-12,71621807,Sharyn,"Raspberry Farm is a stunning location. Guests are met with magical views across the valley, an abundance of bird and wild life and an utter sense of tranquility.<br/><br/>The house itself is very comfortable, tastefully designed and well equipped with everything you may need for a getaway. "
5289072,103883232,2016-09-24,11491693,Jacquie,"We arrived on Monday afternoon and were met by Mary who welcomed us and showed us around her lovely home.   The home was so clean, fresh and very warm with the log fire going.  Our host was always quick to get back to us with any questions we had, and his directions to get there were spot on. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook each night, everything was easy to find. The farm was a lovely base to come back to as we toured around the Barossa or just going for long walks during the day.  Evenings were spent around the fabulous dining table where our family just spent the night talking away, it really felt like home.  We really did get value for money and this is a place that we would love to return to one day and it was sad to leave on the Saturday. It really was a perfect place for the six of us just to enjoy, relax and spend time together. Our family wholeheartedly recommends staying at the Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm.  Thanks to Phillip and Mary."
5289072,111330979,2016-10-30,89786189,Jay,"This is a very spacious cabin suitated within a beautiful surroundings. Getting up in the morning and having breakfast at the dining table over looking the surroundings is a wonderful experience. There was a friendly kangeroo roaming in the yard too. If we werent so busy running around the Barossa visiting wineries, it would have been a wonderful place to have a relaxing slow day and have a BBQ and relax.<br/>Phil was there waiting for us on time (we were 10min late) on the arrival date.<br/>We are very pleased with the place"
5289072,112677958,2016-11-06,62999061,Laura,It was a lovely getaway with a lovely view and really enjoyed our stay. We stayed with another couple and there was plenty of space.  I would highly recommend this place to others.

We had three couples in total and we felt at home, surrounded by beautiful scenery and a fully catered to kitchen, which allowed us to cook our own meals. Other than the beautiful sounds of nature, there were no noisiness from passing cars or commuters. A highly recommended place for a quiet getaway. "

A beautiful space with a wonderful panoramic valley view. Well appointed and equipped accommodation in easy reach of local amenities and the wonders of The Barossa. We will definitely be back!
5289072,211705443,2017-11-13,66505591,Larry,Even If the star rating options were higher than those shown - we would score Philip and Mary’s place the max possible.<br/>The attention to detail and the amenities offered are truly above and beyond.<br/>Everything is so close to Mt Mckenzie that any Drive to wineries even the ‘far’ ones like Seppeltsfield or Wolf Blass are only ~15-20mins away. <br/>There is nothing a traveler could want for by staying at this wonderful log cabin which is so cosy and yet so spacious with more than enough accommodation for a family of 5 or 3 couples. <br/>Cannot reccomend Rasberry Farm high enough<br/><br/>Thanks again to Philip and Mary - excellent hosts

Our hosts ensured we were able to find the house, waited for us to arrive in the evening with the lights on and heater going. The bottle of wine from their own small vineyard, was an unexpected touch and greatly appreciated by the wine drinkers in our group. The kitchen was stocked with useful items, like herbs and spices, milk, jams and sauces etc. A big collection of DVDs and CDs to handle anybody's taste. Lots of towels.

5289072,506730774,2019-08-11,276505735,Emily,"A fantastic place to stay and a wonderful host! Philip and his wife made us feel at home from the moment we walked in the door. The house is absolutely stunning and particularly snug with a toasty fire to keep you warm if you happen to stay on a particularly rainy weekend (like we did). We had six people in our group and felt like there was lots of space for everyone to do their own thing, whether it was cooking, playing card games, reading or watching a film. The wonderful little extras that we found in the house made our stay truly memorable. Cannot wait to come back again and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay somewhere magical in the Barossa."

5289072,559879275,2019-11-05,56753859,Kelly,Phil’s house was a wonderful place for the 6 of us to unwind and enjoy the peace and quiet. It had everything we needed and allowed us all enough space so that we were not on top of each other.<br/><br/>Phil met us on checkin and was great with information with the house and the local wineries.
5289072,564465811,2019-11-15,82455264,Peter,"Phil's place is a great space for a family or group of friends. It's well located for tours of the Barossa Valley. He was a great host with some good local tips, and he was really flexible with check in even though our plane was delayed. Would definitely stay again."
5289072,568083270,2019-11-24,229754788,Janice,"It’s an exceptional location, close to Angaston and the wineries of the Barossa, yet rural and peaceful enough to feel like you’re away from it all. The property is beautifully presented, with everything you could need to be comfortable. We would love to visit again next time we’re in the Barossa!"

5289072,613452096,2020-03-02,142690181,Joan,"What a lovely spacious log cabin with views over the North Para River. Angaston, Nuriootpa and other villages in the Barossa wine region are within very easy reach. Phil and Mary have a well supplied kitchen, with breakfast supplies, including some homemade goodies like jam, marmalade, sauces, and they even gave us a bottle of their wine. Lots of wildlife, bird book plus leaflets for local exploring."
5289072,618255491,2020-03-15,7417575,Aimee,A gorgeous spot to really soak in. Gorgeous views - a lovely welcome bottle of wine that was crafted by Phil himself. A lovely detail and communication was perfect. Definitely will look to go back!

5289072,423442164122101768,2021-08-07,93531254,Carolina,"What an amazing place to be. Our experience started with Phillip welcoming us in a very friendly manner. There already was fire in the fire-pit and the house was really warm and cozy, which gave us a real feel of being away from the city and close to nature.<br/>On the following day we woke up to an amazing view of the mountains. We went on nature walks, saw some sheep and kangaroos and had an amazing stay. Thank you Phillip!"
5289072,428464529735355883,2021-08-14,43483439,Linda,"Phillip’s place was a hidden gem! Raspberry Farm is the perfect getaway if you are looking to switch off and unwind. The scenery is breath taking and felt immediately relaxed as soon as we arrived. We definitely recommend this place to everyone. It’s clean, spacious and has a warm homey feeling. Thanks Phillip for sharing your beautiful home with us."

Andrew is a friendly, helpful host with a great knowledge of the local area. Andrew and Belinda were happy to provide anything extra I needed. As I was their first guest, they were still putting the final touches to the accommodation. Andrew's place was good value for money, especially for a budget conscious traveller."
5426792,55833823,2015-12-06,38514360,Alex,Friendly & generous host.  All needs were met with ease. Perfect for the Traveller or for business. Will be back. 
5426792,56501400,2015-12-14,48210388,Prue,"We couldn't have had a more friendly or helpful host, he made us very welcome. We only stayed for one night when we went to 'a day on the green' and what do you need the most? A comfy bed for a good nights sleep - and that's what we had. In the morning we discovered that the fridge had fresh fruit and milk (the things we needed for breakfast) and a host of other options. Recommend if you need good clean friendly accomodation."
5426792,58942435,2016-01-05,20462909,Nicole,"Andrew and family were lovely! Friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. Located in the heart of the Barossa, the separate backyard unit had everything we needed during our stay. Would definitely stay here again! "
5426792,71407982,2016-04-25,16161274,Ai-Ping,"Andrew and Belinda were both very welcoming and friendly. Their room had everything my partner and I needed and we felt very comfortable there during our stay. On top of that, we had a lot of privacy because it was a separate building from the house. <br/><br/>We were visiting the Barossa for the weekend and we found that all the places we wanted to visit were only 15 minute drives away, which made getting around very convenient. If we visit the barossa again, we will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!<br/><br/>"
5426792,72037336,2016-04-30,11313730,Penny,"Andrew was very friendly and helpful, even showing me the way to a meeting the day before so I wouldn't get lost on the day. Close to town too.<br/>The shed was just as you see it on the web and the only thing that I would have liked would have been a little outdoor sitting space. Otherwise I would recommend this accommodation.<br/>Thanks Andrew"
5426792,74349137,2016-05-15,53524879,Josh,"The accommodation was great. Immaculate, great facilities, and friendly hosts. Would happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. Central location in the Barossa too! "

I found Andrew very helpful, and Belinda made sure I had clean sheets and towels weekly. <br/>The area is very nice, and is close to Linear Park, which was lovely for walks, even in the wintertime. "

5426792,101836544,2016-09-15,14604779,Barbara,"Stayed one very cold night. No electric blankets but Andrew did have the room heated prior to our arrival. No crockery or proper cutlery and an antique pantry/meat safe was not appropriate in the sleeping area. Overall, we left awfully early as we were not going to drink tea/coffee from plastic cups."
5426792,102341951,2016-09-17,24986439,Alice,"These are hosts that really care. The accommodation is simple but very comfortable and caters for any needs you might have. The room, kitchenette and bathroom were all very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was the little things that really made the stay great though. The towels and face washers were folded and arranged neatly on the bed, the end of the toilet paper was folded into a triangle and a list of useful numbers (such as where to get the best pizza) was provided. Further from this, the greeting was warm, friendly and sincere and the hosts made themselves very easy to contact if there was any need. I felt like a cherished guest, being welcomed into their home and will definitely be back."
5426792,113040678,2016-11-09,100726963,Paul,"Andrew & Belinda made us feel really welcome.  Everything was set up ready for our arrival, and they had been in contact with us promptly on booking.  A very smooth stay - top hospitality.  Everything was clean and tidy.  It was also great fun staying in a garage conversion - exactly as described."
5426792,113458999,2016-11-12,7000014,Thibaut,"Well located in the centre of the Barossa Valley, we were welcomed by Andrew and started our exploration nicely. The shed was good and clean. Unfortunately, we had a lot of wind and rain and you can hear it during the night. A little minus point was a bit of insects around but didn't bother us too much. "
5426792,114985005,2016-11-21,76521547,Emily,"We stayed with Andrew and Belinda for one night. The converted garage room was self contained, comfortable and private. As our stay was short so we didn't meet Belinda but Andrew was friendly and accommodating. A great place to stay if you would like to spend a few days exploring SA's beautiful Barossa Valley."
5426792,117110331,2016-12-04,74548150,Andrew,"Well place in the centre of Nuriootpa, was a good place to base myself for the wedding that I was attending.  "

5426792,153357192,2017-05-21,23174829,Richard,"With such a quirky description we did not know what to expect - but it was as described. A B&B in a shed! Once inside we forgot that. Plenty of room, comfortable bed, good bathroom and well equipped kitchen.<br/><br/>Andrew and Belinda are warm friendly people and true to their nature they provided a comprehensive do-it-yourself breakfast. Great value and we will return!"

The place is nicely set-up, very clean and all is provided for (good private space, nice breakfast, clean towels and linen). Andrew and Belinda are great hosts, always up for a chat and providing great tips and places to visit in the region. From their place it's a short walk to the Vine Inn, great restaurant for dinner at a reasonable price. It is also a strategic location to visit the wineries in the Barossa Valley.<br/><br/>We will definitely recommend their place to fellow travelers and we will book it again for our next trip to the Barossa!"
5426792,193266277,2017-09-13,59553932,Mark & Dianne,Very comfortable accommodation in an excellent location. A very warm welcome from Andrew had us settled in quickly. The facilities were ideal for our requirements and we would be happy to stay again.

He made regular contact leading up to ensure I knew exactly what the arrangements were. Kitchen has a bar fridge, single pot/pan induction hot plate, microwave, kettle and toaster. Great heating and cooling in the bedroom if needed (although is well insulated), with a sizeable TV and comfy queen bed. Bathroom and all areas were spotless.

5426792,357314312,2018-12-10,5808248,Andrew,"The description is pretty clear - it's a shed at the back of a house on a quiet road in Nuriootpa. The centre of Nuriootpa is easily walkable from the house, but from anywhere in Nuriootpa you'll need a car or a taxi to get to Tanunda or our dinner destination Hently Farm.<br/><br/>The shed has everything you need for a couple - really good aircon; a nice light and airy bathroom; a fridge for storing wine, milk and water; and good stable wifi. There is a cupboard full of crockery, cutlery and glassware. It's not designed to cook in but you could happily have a deli platter, light breakfast or takeaway meal there."

Andrew knocked on the door in the evening to check everything was okay and also to give me the heads up that he was lighting the BBQ nearby, if I wanted to throw anything on. I thought that was very polite! 😊 Quick responders, especially at late notice. <br/><br/>The only negative was a relatively constant smell of cigarette smoke coming through the window in the evening, I’m not a smoker so it was rather unpleasant."

5426792,700307675,2020-10-14,133253,John & Lyn,Perfect for an overnight stay with a few added extras. You would need a car to gate around as it is not central.

5426792,708854021,2020-11-14,101681575,Scott,"Andrew and Belinda's shed is pretty amazing. From the outside... It's a shed. Walk inside and it is a cozy room with a comfy bed, nice tv and kick ass aircon. The place was very clean and well equipped.<br/>Andrew and Belinda could not have been nicer. Their communication leading up to my stay including check instructions was fantastic and when I met them, they were very friendly and even invited me to have a beer with them. I like beer so of course I accepted. :)"

While Andrew and Belinda’s backyard shedhaus doesn’t include any of the fine luxurious touches you see in hotels, the place has tonnes of DIY charm and had absolutely everything we could ever want for our cycling trip around the Barossa. Andrew is so friendly and willing to help offer advice. We thoroughly enjoyed grabbing a beer with him and Belinda on our last night. Thanks for the stay!"

Felt like a safe area, fairly quiet, good location. A bit off-putting that the only sink was in the bathroom (a little unhygienic to wash your dishes!). Overall cleanliness was very good (even the remote was clean), though minor attention needed for some areas (eg, vacuum carpet, clean bathroom blind). Toilet paper was very thin. Very comfortable bed. Great value for money.<br/><br/>Communication was excellent, very good hosts. Overall, I had a great stay and would definitely stay again."

The bed was comfortable and bathroom clean. Heater worked a treat and shower was instantly warm with soft water, a real winner. We were within walking distance to the vine inn that provides great meals and live entertainment. We also had our bikes so we could easily ride to local wineries. Look forward to staying again when we are next in the area. thankyou to our hosts. 😊"

We were lucky enough to meet Nelly and Guido - their passion for wine and the history of the Barossa is contagious. <br/><br/>If you need a place to stay for a trip to the Barossa this is it! Close to everywhere you need to go, and with a large room if you'd just like to relax (the views are incredible!)<br/><br/>The last thing I'll say is that their wine is delicious.

6149133,79732925,2016-06-13,11461028,Brooke,I stayed at the Reserve Barossa Valley one a group trip with a few couples and had the best time!  Simone was extremely helpful in giving us all the information we were after before our arrival. The property is beautiful and looks just like the pictures (maybe better). Everything was nice and clean. We loved the wood fire pizza oven and the spa! Would highly recommend
6157653,34479591,2015-06-08,19977907,Kimberley,"A massive thank you to Julie for such a wonderful stay in the Barossa. If you're looking for a beautiful B&B in a perfect location this is it. The property was perfect, beautifully decorated, super clean and new and lots of privacy. My friend and I were sad to leave. Also great breakfast from the local cafe which Julie provides $20 daily vouchers for. Highly recommend Barossa Barn! "
6157653,42869084,2015-08-16,15463417,Andy,"Lovely location. Friendly and discrete owners.<br/>Nice and warm inside during cold Barossa winter!"
6157653,49635430,2015-10-05,24532455,Michelle,"We had a lovely stay in the Barossa at Julie's converted barn.  Well equipped and spacious, beautifully decorated (love a chandelier in a bathroom!) and gorgeous gardens.  <br/><br/>While there are limited cooking facilities, this is amply compensated by vouchers for breakfast each day at a local cafe in Angaston.  (Breakfast is served until 3pm and the servings are huge!)<br/><br/>Julie does note in her listing that the bathroom in on the lower level, with master bed/living space upstairs.  This wasn't problematic for us, however the stairs are quite steep so property wouldn't suit someone with mobility issues.  <br/><br/>Thanks for a delightful stay."
6157653,53265739,2015-11-07,4368878,Peter,"We were greeted by Julie and welcomed to the Barossa Barn. The first impression was WOW. The photos don't do justice to the warm and sophisticated feeling of this listing. We had a fantastic stay. Julie & Neil have thought of everything, lots of information, great facilities, a most comfortable bed, even Foxtel with all the HD movie channels etc. The breakfast vouchers were also excellent, entitling us to a delicious cooked breakfast at a nearby cafe. The location was also excellent. A perfect centre point to our daily excursions around the Barossa wineries. Special mention: try to have dinner at Ferment Asian. A delightful experience with 5 star service."
6157653,54092062,2015-11-16,39560375,Amy,Everything about our stay at Barossa Barn was perfect! The location was great and the accommodations very charming as well as the local breakfast cafe and our wonderful hosts. We would highly recommend a stay here if you are planning a visit to the Barossa. Julie and Neil even helped us with planning our itinerary and dining options. This mini-vacation could not have been better for us!
6157653,54622453,2015-11-22,47796153,Coralee,"Julie our host welcomed us on arrival, showed us to her unique beautiful B@B it was as described on line so charming, convenient comfortable to all the Barossa. It was a perfect delight to stay in this charming atmosphere with all her wonderful furnishings, fruit platters port a gorgeous weekend.<br/>Thank You<br/><br/>Coralee<br/> "
6157653,55259063,2015-11-29,12146271,Andrea,Lovely accomodation in a peaceful and very handy area of the Barossa. Every comfort you could wish for and exceptionally clean and welcoming. We spent two nights at the barn and could have spent longer if we had more time. Breakfast included at the local cafe was great as was the free wifi. Highly recommend!
6157653,67492802,2016-03-29,56120503,Angela,"My partner and I enjoyed a quiet weekend at the Barossa Barn. The accommodation is a bit of comfort in a rustic setting. Julie and Neil were busy gardening on their lovely property when we arrived. The house (converted barn) is set up with 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and toilet downstairs, and large open room upstairs with a queen bed, living area and efficiency-type kitchen. There is a small balcony off the top of the stairs that overlooks the garden.<br/><br/>The bed was very comfy, with high quality sheets. We were able to make coffee in the morning with the kettle and french press provided. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, cutlery, and glasses, and supplies for tea and coffee. We enjoyed a picnic dinner one evening with the spoils of our trip to the Barossa Farmer’s Market and the Barossa Cheese Company, both of which are just down the road. There’s plenty of cutting boards and knives for the cheeses, breads and mettwurst! Lovely to be able to enjoy a real taste of the region, and I really do strongly recommend a visit to Farmer's Market during your stay. We did not take advantage of the breakfasts supplied at the local cafe, as we were either getting an early start out to the wineries or sleeping in.<br/><br/>The nights were perfectly quiet and we slept soundly. The location is semi-suburban. They are the outer edge of a residential neighbourhood as it transitions into farmland. Angaston was a lovely little township about 2km away, and there is plenty to eat and drink nearby. It’s a nice area for strolling. We took a taxi one evening for a special dinner so that we could enjoy the wine. <br/><br/>All in all a very pleasant, relaxing stay— wish we could have stayed longer, and would definitely stay again. Wonderful location for a good food and wine weekend!"
6157653,75727197,2016-05-22,43325498,Damien,"The place was beautiful and Julie was more than accommodating, even providing a complimentary bottle of wine because of a faulty TV! Highly recommended."

6157653,263022195,2018-05-11,152550529,Chris,A beautiful spot in a cozy cottage. Julie is an excellent host; great service and advice for sightseeing. Neat and tiny; an old building with history with modern amenities for comfort.
6157653,266292875,2018-05-19,26397239,Sarah,"My husband and I booked The Barn for our first visit to the Barossa. We wanted a unique space to stay for 2 nights that was central to the wine tasting action - and this location is perfect! Check in was seamless - Julie texted me the key code so we could let ourselves in to the property. It was chilly when we arrived, however,  the air-con acts as a heater and kept us warm all weekend. <br/><br/>We were very impressed by the space and the thoughtful touches from Julie - wine tasting map and information, details on local activities and things to do (such as the Saturday morning Farmer's Market - unmissable!), a tasty Port for after dinner and other special touches. <br/><br/>The kitchen only has a microwave, so we ate out one evening and bought curries from the Farmer's Market to heat up the next evening. The bathroom is beautiful with an amazing claw foot tub I enjoyed an aromatherapy bath in. The stairs up to the main area are narrow and sloping, so it's not recommended for people with mobility issues as the bathroom and toilet are downstairs. Julie supplies Foxtel as the local channels are limited. We found the bed too hard for our liking, however, we prefer a very soft bed, so this is purely personal preference. <br/><br/>Overall, highly recommended for location, space and comfort. Thanks, Julie!"
6157653,628426040,2020-06-08,242597904,Mikayla,Exceeded our expectations! We will definitely recommend this bnb to those we know. <br/>Thank you for a lovely stay!

The bed was super comfortable and the breakfast vouchers we're great! The Barn made our Barossa valley trip really memorable and we hope to be back again soon and will be recommending it to our friends. thanks again Julie!!"

There is also a lovely garden area with seating but the poor weather prevented us from making the most of it. Being able to bring our well behaved dog was a big bonus. We enjoyed the large range of music CD's and there were also a large range of DVD's but being out most of the time We didn't use the latter.

6170279,206338193,2017-10-25,127821585,Louise,Had a lovely two night stay at Little Para cottage in Tanunda.  The cottage was so homely and comfortable and the private garden a lovely place to sit and relax with an evening drink or breakfast in the sun.  Lots of little touches and attention to detail made this a particularly special stay.  Great location for visiting neighbouring wineries  - some within a 5 minute walk from Little Para -  and the town centre of Tanunda.  Would highly recommend.

6170279,226862644,2018-01-12,93599626,Cat,"Wendy was a warm and welcoming host and was happy to help out in any way.  The outside space was particularly impressive, with interesting, eclectic and creative objects, and lots of segmented seating areas for afternoon drinks, breakfast or anything in between.  It was also a very private space, and we felt very much at home here.  The bed was very comfortable and whilst it was a bit dark inside the house, this worked well for the hot days, as did the airconditioner.  If you want to visit the Barossa for a period of time, this is a perfect place to stay as it's a great location, right on the edge of town with a fabulous restauraunt at one end of the street, and numerous wineries at the other, all within walking distance.  Also right next to the bike path.  Thanks for making our stay memorable Wendy!"

6170279,235230278,2018-02-16,50157837,Romina,"I recently stayed at Wendy's cottage for a night, it was a beautiful space and Wendy was very hospitable. We informed her we would be arriving early due to doing a wine tour that started at 10am and asked if we could leave our rental car there, which she said was no problem. When we arrived, the previous guests had already left so Wendy was kind enough to let us leave our bags in the cottage garden and wait there until our tour car arrived. The space itself is gorgeous, had all the amenities we needed, a comfy bed and lovely garden area. It's very close to a few good wine/restaurant spots too. Thanks Wendy!"

6170887,40950252,2015-08-03,15160525,Chloe,"The first time I have booked using airbnb and I am a convert thanks to the Elderton Wines Guest house. As a group of four girls from Melbourne and Perth we stayed here last weekend (the beginning of August). The house is in such a central location, it's specious and was a great space to stay in winter and we all could picture it being just as wonderful at any time of the year. We instantly felt at home.  The house could also comfortably sleep six people with three bedrooms and has all the facilities you might need. <br/><br/>We were made to feel really welcome with a bottle of wine on our arrival and our host recommending restaurants and wineries to us before we arrived. When we come back to the Barossa we will most definitely stay here! "
6170887,45948275,2015-09-07,37290444,Alison,"The stay at Elderton Lodge was great, we received a warm welcome from Tush, the lodge was comfortable and convenient to all amenities.<br/><br/>We enjoyed tasting the wines at the tasting room and sharing a bottle kindly provided by the lodge.<br/><br/>Would recommend this to others wishing to explore the Barossa."
6170887,52217422,2015-10-27,41674703,Brendan,Elderton Wines lodge was a clean and comfortable house. It is well located within walking distance of most locations in Nuriootpa.

6170887,57889981,2015-12-30,47735914,Nemish,We loved our staying in Elderton Guest house. House is perfectly located near to all the shops and restaurants.  Best part was the park near by which kids enjoyed every day. I would say it is perfect place for small family of two adult and 2 kids to group of 4 to 5 adults.
6170887,60981555,2016-01-30,37530274,Jack,"What an amazing Place. Elderton guest house is the perfect base for exploring the Barossa. The house was close to the centre of Nuriootpa and right next door to the Elderton vineyard.<br/><br/>On arrival, a bottle of red and a bottle of white were awating for us in the house. The place was very clean and tidy with everything and more than you need. <br/><br/>Tush thank you so much for being such an amazing host, and indulging us with a wine tasting. I recommend this to anyone who stays there. Tush is also a wealth of knowledge on what to explore in the area and also made us feel extremely welcome.<br/><br/>We will definitely be back.  <br/>"

6170887,71199410,2016-04-24,33000424,Ken,"We were four guys enjoying a golf and wines experience. Communication leading up to our stay was terrific. Once there, everything was at or above expectation. We collected the keys from Elderton Cellar Door and enjoyed an excellent tasting session hosted by Tush (rhymes with ""rush"", of which there was none - but ""just don't call me Trish""). We learned from her and enjoyed her suggested wines.<br/>All voted for a return next year.<br/>"
6170887,79731516,2016-06-13,27806867,Megan,"Comfortable and cozy stay. Great location. Stayed here with 6 guests  (2 couples 2 friends ) and it was a good size, not too small.

6170887,104829974,2016-09-28,2724177,Brittany,"Very close to all amenities and some amazing wineries.

Some nights spent enjoying the Barossa, and some cooking at home. Very enjoyable!<br/>Thank you!"

The house was in a great central but also nice and quiet location for visiting the nearby wineries and restaurants. The house is very nice with two full bedrooms, a kitchen and living room and very modern bathroom. The providing of continental breakfast supplies were great for feeding us in the mornings. <br/><br/>The only hiccup during our stay was that the hot water heater was broken when we arrived. The hosts sent their maintenance people out the next morning to fix it which was excellent, unfortunately this meant we only had hot water for the last morning of our two night stay."
6170887,139140079,2017-03-23,27634546,Kimberley,"A group of 6 friends stayed here on our way to Clare for a wedding. The staff at Elderton were very welcoming.

6296823,110833926,2016-10-28,99153392,Matthew,"Don't be fooled by the 1980's build as this place has immense charm, abundant good taste and a great layout. Secluded and private but also in a perfect position for exploring the valley. Surrounded by grapevines, native cypress and its own kitchen garden. Cynthia encouraged foraging so we grazed on fresh herbs, spinach, spring onions and asparagus. An ideal experience; a microcosm of the broader growers valley itself. Rolf and Cynthia are generous hosts and the breakfast provisions, wine and facilities were terrific. We only had a few days, but a meal at FermentAsian was sublime and by the time we dined at Hentley Farm, reality was slipping as the euphoria was overtaking us. A perfect break and Veritas cottage was so central to it all in more ways than one. A brilliant place to stay. Thanks."

The check in & communication with our host Cynthia at all times was super-easy. There were a number of small touches that really made the cottage excellent, including ample food for breakfasts, local information, complimentary bottle of wine and an honesty bar with extra wine if you run out. The air conditioning was a must for us (we spent Christmas Day here at 40 degree heat, so that was essential). <br/><br/>There is one other property nearby but the cottage feels extremely private. There is a nice little patio area with chairs & a table looking out onto the vines. "

6296823,159382259,2017-06-11,56314903,Lucy,"Loved our stay at veritas cottage. The cottage was perfect, a retro feel, in a beautiful garden setting. Cynthia and Rolf were extremely hospitable. Just look inside their fridge for eg. Eggs bacon sausages fruit yogurt bread OJ - you name it. Very cosy clean and in a perfect spot when touring around the barossa valley- tasting all the beautiful wines. Rolf being his own winemaker - giving us a tour - tasting wines out of the barrell was a very personal touch. Thankyou. They also left us a bottle of their wine 🍷to enjoy. And their yummy port. Very fun hosts- allowing us to join their night. Definitly a must stay at the cottage- a peaceful getaway- and a must to go tasting at their cellar door. Beautiful wines. Some of the nicest in the Barossa. Cynthias communication was perfect prior- sharing tips for us. Thankyou to both of you. A perfect stay."

Lovely cottage, clean, and very homely. Also a complimentary bottle of wine, and some port from their winery! Good place to rest and relax. Cynthia is also very quick with any inquiries. Last but not least, do wine tasting at the cellar door, I love the wine! I would highly recommend this place. And I hope to come back for longer stay."
6296823,189792831,2017-09-03,20995027,Elena,"Rolf and Cynthia were fantastic hosts. We experienced a wonderful wine tasting and Cynthia was kind enough to give us a lift to the cottage afterwards. The cottage is lovely, decorated in 50s style and well located with great wineries nearby. The kitchen was packed with fresh produce, for a delicious breakfast. We recommend it to everyone and look forward to our next stay!"
6296823,195552286,2017-09-19,14703539,Stefania,"We loved our stay at the Veritas cottage, it's a beautiful, relaxing and quiet spot in the outskirt of Tanunda. Many restaurants and wineries are just a short drive away, two wineries are in walking distance.<br/>Cynthia provided us with a generous supply of breakfast items, fruits, milk, cereals, jams, bacon and fresh eggs from her chickens. And a bottle of superb wine from the Rolf Binder winery - they make beautiful wines.<br/>Absolutely outstanding is the hospitality of Cynthia and Rolf, they made us feel more than welcome and part of the family. We will be back!"
6296823,196619873,2017-09-23,60344542,Janet,"A delightful place to spend a weekend away.  The herb and vege gardens were great and there is a lovely spot to sit out the front and enjoy the bird-life and peaceful surrounds. Very tranquil. The interior is clean and unfussy, with hardwood floors throughout (big tick for those with allergies). And yes, those gorgeous retro lounge chairs you see in the photos are super comfy to sit in. Cynthia is a very caring host and her communication was excellent. Thank you Cynthia!"
6296823,220128975,2017-12-20,80620872,Fridrik,"Cynthia and Rolf are great hosts. From the start we booked with them, Cynthia was eager to assist us in booking activities and help us get the most of the visit.<br/>Once there, they had arranged breakfast for us, ready in the kitchen, bottle of wine and we did some wine tasting at their winery and Rolf showed us part of their production site.<br/>Very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend Cynthia and Rolf's place."

Cynthia is a very thoughtful host - having the house warm and cosy when we arrived in the evening. The breakfast provisions are generous and delicious. We can highly recommend staying at this lovely little cottage. "
6296823,329034073,2018-09-28,7190897,Deb,Rolf and Cynthia’s accommodation was a wonderful base for exploring the Barossa. Cynthia gave us some great tips for things to do and see in the area. Definitely visit their winery for beautiful reds and Cynthia’s knowledge of the wine industry.

6296823,529556955,2019-09-15,1324190,Elan,"Cynthia and Rolf’s cosy cottage was everything you’d need for a stay in the Barossa. Brilliantly located just out of the throng of Tanunda and a short to medium stroll to some of the Barossa’s finest vineyards, this thoughtfully finished, welcoming home truly made our stay. Biggest of thanks to both of you guys for the delicious brekkie goods and a bottle of 2015 Shiraz that turned out to be our fave! All the best :)"
6296823,534665923,2019-09-23,108943425,Pru,"Thank you so much. Cynthia was very responsive, thoughtful and made us feel like nothing was an effort. Great location. Breakfast provision a great touch."

Some thoughtful vintage choices sprinkled around.  I felt like I was visiting with my lovely nan for the weekend.  The added bonus is some top notch wineries within walking distance."
6296823,707267643,2020-11-07,23923651,Elly,"A cosy little cottage, very good location. Very clean and has everything you need. <br/>Breakfast provisions provided were sourced locally and were delicious.<br/>Thanks for a lovely long weekend."

The beds are really comfy, the shower is great and the location is very quiet at night time. We were surprised at the generous breakfast provisions and were catered to our (vegan) dietary requirements. Cynthia was very responsive to our messages and went over and above to help us out. We'd highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to stay close to Tanunda and everything the Barossa has to offer."
6296823,402438347839875011,2021-07-09,45122413,Neridah,"We had such a terrific time at Verita’s Cottage. It was a last minute booking and Cynthia could not have been more helpful. The cottage was spotlessly clean, the linen was beautifully laundered and the breakfast supplies were very generous. We walked to town each day (20mins) for a great coffee at Darling Cafe and explored the main street. We visited the Jam Factory, Vasse Virgin and Maggie Beer’s all of which were a 10 minute max drive away. Cynthia and Rolf were very welcoming (allowing our daughters to do some cross country running training around their property and lighting a bonfire for our last night).  We had a really lovely time.  Thank you Cynthia and Rolf!"
6296823,404563062649727864,2021-07-12,256540354,Sally,"Lovely cottage, just outside Tanunda. Very clean and comfortable. Plenty of breakfast provisions left for us.  Would highly recommend for a getaway to the Barossa."

7055506,40957667,2015-08-03,3242998,Gloria,"We had a wonderful stay, Karen made us feel so welcome and at home and gave us lots of helpful suggestions on where to go during our trip.  Absolutely fantastic location, just a short drive from all of the wineries and town centre.  We especially loved the indoor fireplace, fluffy bathrobes and that the pantry was so well stocked with farm fresh produce - we didn't have to go out to get anything. Karen was easy going and really helpful - always just a quick text or call away.  The house was spotless and made a great retreat. We would definitely come back!"
7055506,42422921,2015-08-13,5777212,Ian,"Is there a better place to stay in the Barossa Valley ?? Nestled in a beautiful little vineyard, you are just a few minutes from Tanunda and Nuriootpa and all that they have to offer. The cottage has all you could possibly need and Karen stocks the larder with sensational local produce. Would not hesitate to recommend the Vineyard Cottage to friends and family. "
7055506,45419479,2015-09-02,4425011,Amanda,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at under the vines. Karen was very welcoming and there is lots of local area info available at the property. The local produce provided for brekky was fantastic, and loved chilling out with a wine by the fire in the evenings. Location is close to lots of wineries and eateries. Would definitely recommend this awesome spot! "
7055506,46423269,2015-09-10,41965695,Daniel,Was a wonderful experience staying at Under the vines. When we arrived there was a little chocolate on the bed for each guest and there was even a treat for our 18 month old toddler. The description and location were accurate and we really enjoyed staying here. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.
7055506,48710441,2015-09-28,9441817,Justin,Karren was lovely she was very welcoming and the place was much as described and more. She helped me out great sorted out wine and a platter for me for a special occassion it was close to wineries as we rode our bikes around for the day. I would very much recomend karen and her cottage we will certianly be back. Lovely spot. 
7055506,52740541,2015-11-01,10899597,Yvonne,"Great house on small vineyard, with an incredibly well equipped kitchen, with local milk and cream in the fridge! Great location, only a max 15 minute drive to all the main attractions of Barossa."
7055506,56120731,2015-12-09,25514930,Michelle,"Karen made us feel very welcome, by greeting us at the property and showing us where everything was. She gave us some excellent local tips - where to eat, which wineries to visit, etc.<br/><br/>The property was great. Very private and truly under the vines - gorgoeus, handy location. It was clean and well appointed with comfortable king sized beds, excellent breakfasts and AC (much needed on our 40+ degree mini break!). "
7055506,59507895,2016-01-11,29343482,Dan,"I really enjoyed my stay at Under the Vines. A very cool venue, complete with jacuzzi bath and surrounded by the vines. Karen made the process very smooth and we'd be happy to recommend it to friends."
7055506,60272629,2016-01-21,15948897,David,"What a fantastic spot! Thanks to Karen for meeting us on a tricky timeframe as we raced across NSW, Victoria and SA, but the trip was well worth it. Well-appointed for our group of five, with beautiful local produce for breakfast waiting for us. Sitting on the back porch looking over the vines to the Barossa Ranges was amazing and everywhere we wanted to visit was within easy reach. Bathroom and exterior toilets are fine - just watch out for the spiders."
7055506,60679314,2016-01-26,47291939,Kelly,"The perfect location for a weekend in the Barossa - quiet, set amongst vineyards, and close to Tanunda. The breakfast supplies were phenomenal and there's all the basics you need if you're going to cook a meal for dinner. Karen and Russell were great hosts, and very receptive to our individual requests. We totally recommend Under the Vines!"
7055506,62154294,2016-02-12,23573308,Paul,"Two big thumbs up!  The description and photos are entirely accurate.  This is a delightful, spacious, fully equipped and comfortable home.  That it's smack dab in the middle of a vineyard is a bonus.  It's about halfway between the villages of Tanunda and  Nurioopa, so a car is needed for shopping and restaurants. The location is otherwise perfect as a base for wine tasting in the Barossa.  "
7055506,63032285,2016-02-19,56888746,Peter,"Under The Vines was a perfect little spot for a relaxing stay. Everything was provided and the food provided was of exceptional quality and taste.<br/><br/>This is definitely a hidden gem among quality Barossa accommodation. <br/><br/>I most certainly recommend staying here."
7055506,65012671,2016-03-10,54111226,Claire,"We stayed at Karen's vineyard cottage at the beginning of March and had the most wonderful time.  The accommodation was exactly as described and the kitchen was so well stocked with equipment it was like being in my own kitchen at home.<br/>The locally sourced breakfast items that were provided were amazing as were all the little extras like leaving a little box of smarties for our toddler.<br/>It was great to have all the entertainment equipment as we loved being able to plug our iPod in and also watch some movies.  <br/>The beds were very comfortable and huge and we slept very well there.<br/>It was vintage during our stay and Russell was so good at ensuring that we were not disturbed; often we didn't even know he was around.  However, after he discovered we were genuinely interested in what was happening, he spent quite a bit of his time explaining everything and was so friendly - it was a highlight of the trip!<br/>Karen was a fantastic host who from the beginning answered all our queries very quickly and was there to greet us when we arrived.  The actual location was super convenient, close to lots of wineries and very peaceful but with only a short drive into the centre of town. We are very much hoping to come back and spend some more time here."
7055506,65561689,2016-03-15,57475174,Chiara,"My stay at Under the Vines was just perfect! I was part of a group of 5 girls that stayed at Karen's cottage and we all loved our time here. Everything was set up beautifully for us, even 'female' themed with pink balloons, chocolates and pink champagne. The cottage has a great living area, separate spacious kitchen and 2 large bedrooms. Beautiful big bathroom too. The back of the cottage overlooks the private vineyard which added to the feel of being in the Barossa wine region. The cottage was in a great spot in the Barossa region, on 5 minute drive to the Tanunda town centre. <br/>Karen is a wonderful and welcoming host. I wish I could have stayed longer in her beautiful cottage!! "
7055506,66146845,2016-03-20,24417306,Lance,"Under the Vines was an absolutely delightful place to stay. The location was ideal for exploring the Barossa, dining out and relaxing in an ideallic setting. Karen and Russell were marvellous hosts, who ensured we wanted for nothing. We highly recommend staying here and we will be back."
7055506,70566426,2016-04-18,64729289,Hayley,"We loved our time at Under the Vines. When we arrived the kitchen was stocked with milk, eggs, tomato, mushrooms, cereal and some of the best bacon we've had in a long time. Not to mention locally roasted coffee! The house is clean and spacious with a huge shower and spa bath. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, glassware etc. Even had sharp knives! Setting is beautiful being surrounded by a working vineyard (didn't see anyone the whole time so still felt private). It's about 5-10 min drive from Tanunda town centre, which suited us. Seemed to be plenty of taxis around so popping to town for a few drinks with a meal wasn't a problem."
7055506,71502546,2016-04-25,24087877,Tim,"Beautiful property and very welcoming host. We really enjoyed the time, particularly drinking wine on the grass in the middle of a vineyard. The house was warm, tidy, modern and the fireplace was a nice addition for the cool evenings. "
7055506,71983077,2016-04-30,33018208,David,A perfect position and setting in the vines. The house had everything we required and was very well provisioned. Right in the centre of the Barossa. We would definitely come back again.

7055506,82675832,2016-06-28,50364030,Tegan,We had a wonderful stay at under the vines. We had absolutely everything we needed and the accommodation was just perfect. We have spent our days since returning lamenting the lack of a fire place and spar bath in our lives. I would highly recommend this property as an ideal location and luxury accommodation in the Barossa! 
7055506,83783390,2016-07-04,15355595,Anita,"Karen's place was absolutely perfect! She made us feel totally at home. <br/><br/>There was a goodie basket of local produce for breakfast. We had a choice of toast with local jams, muesli, cereal and of course the important bacon and eggs. She'd even left us some orange juice!<br/><br/>The location is great. We thought at first it might be a bit far out of town but it's a very short drive and actually conveniently located between both Tanunda and Angaston. It's set in its own private vineyard. <br/><br/>The photos don't even do it justice. It was very comfortable with great beds and the best bath!<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend Karen's place. Will definitely stay again. "

The breakfast basket was full of local produce ... enough for two days for my wife and I. The woodfire was prepared for us and well stocked for a cosy weekend. The house itself was spotless, well equiped and included a large range of fun things to do. In a great location for getting around the Barossa. All in all, a perfect spot for a romantic weekend."
7055506,104256856,2016-09-25,6480440,Greg,Karen met us just after we arrived and made us feel very welcome. The house had all the amenities and was very clean.

7055506,107547134,2016-10-10,87459040,Brian,"It is set in vineyards with an amazing country feel to the place. The host displayed generous hospitality in supplying an outstanding locally produced gourmet breakfast. The cottage contained up to date comforts to a very high standard including wireless Internet. A great destination for our wedding anniversary. Well located between Nuriootpa, Tanunda and Angaston. A short drive to all the tourist spots including wineries. "
7055506,109304467,2016-10-20,22508329,Samantha,Excellent location and beautiful property. Large bedrooms with black out blinds which made having a lay in far too easy! Well stocked Kitchen meant that we were able to cook easily.<br/>We also loved sitting in the garden in amongst the vines watching the sun go down - beautiful! Would definitely return again in future.
7055506,111569254,2016-10-31,27400365,Melanee,Everything we could've wanted (plus more) was there. Very clean and well appointed throughout ... 6ft husband easily relaxed in the spa. Generous thoughtful hosts. Perfect 2 day honeymoon venue.
7055506,114935775,2016-11-20,26812011,Gemma,"Under the Vines is a quaint but luxurious retreat. It feels very private but is just a few minutes' drive from towns, between Nuriootpa and Tanunda. We stayed here on the first really warm weekend of summer and it was a lovely and cool oasis to return to after visiting wineries and other sights. Drawing the thick curtains allows for easy sleep-ins the next morning. The kitchen is very well stocked with excellent local produce for cooked breakfast, including locally roasted beans to use in the coffee machine. Being surrounded by vineyards makes adds to the feeling of having an authentic Barossa experience. Our host Karen was great in her communication, and even offered to post back a pair of sandals and a Lego piece my children left behind! Much appreciated. "
7055506,116248867,2016-11-28,33631662,Michele,"We had a lovely 5 day stay at Karen's Under the Vines cottage. Karen was a fantastic host and very personable. From booking the cottage to greeting us when we arrive, Karen was very responsive. The cottage is lovely and secluded but was only a 5 min drive into Tanunda. I recommend visiting FermentAsian for excellent dining.  The breakfast provision provided were plentiful and very generous and 5 different types of milk to choose from! This airBnB was probably the most well stocked place I have stayed in.  Clearly much thought has gone into what traveller's might need; this place felt like you were visiting someone's house. Thank you for hosting us Karen and i hope many more visitors have the opportunity to discover this lovely area of the Barossa and your lovely hospitality. "
7055506,120438419,2016-12-10,85267799,Jillian,"Karen's cottage was in a great location almost situated halfway between the towns of Tanunda and Anguston. Very quiet location.  Good size cottage although there was only two us.  If two couples stayed, having the toilet in the bathroom, may be a little difficult. However, with just two of us, the bathroom was very adequate. Very comfortable bed.  Two huge bean bags to sit on the lawn, everything very clean and the kitchen well stocked including tasty breakfast goodies.  We had a relaxing week in the cottage."

The house is on the outskirts of Tanunda so easy access to everything in town while also feeling secluded and private. Also a quick 10 minute drive to Angaston. Location is fantastic.

7055506,132092775,2017-02-15,15118435,Warren,"The photos of Karen's Vineyard Cottage on the website don't do it justice at all.  It is very peaceful and quiet. Karen has outfitted the cottage and provided every possible comfort, food and essentials you can think of to make your stay at the cottage very pleasant.  She has exceeded our expectations........definitely 10 out of 10 and beyond :)<br/>The accomodation is suitable for couples and families.<br/>We highly recommend staying at Karen's Vineyard Cottage when you visit Tanunda.  It is also very centrally located but still offers quiet and peaceful surroundings.<br/>Too many details to comment on and the only way to experience what we experienced is to stay at Karen's Vineyard Cottage.  You will not be disappointed.<br/>One of the best BNB's we have stayed in and we have stayed in many BNBs <br/> "

7055506,157913964,2017-06-05,42874720,Drew,Beautiful place with a very friendly host. The wood burning fire place on a cold night was divine. Will stay here next time I'm in the Barossa valley. 
7055506,159869583,2017-06-11,23552332,Gaby,"We had a great stay at Karen's place over the long weekend. The place had everything you need and very close to some really great wineries making it easy to ride around on bicycles for the day.<br/>The fresh produce was lovely, the coffee delicious, access to some port in the barrel also a bonus and the fire being ready in the fireplace a great touch for our wintery getaway.<br/>We couldn't fault our stay in this place and would recommend to all that want to discover the Barossa!"

7055506,166253776,2017-07-03,9151346,Kristin,"Quiet base with everything you need for a relaxing stay.  If only there was nothing else to do in the Barossa, we would have just been happy to enjoy the little home in the vineyard.  Karen greeted us personally and encouraged us to relax and treat ourselves which was easily done.  The country breakfast goodies provided were a delicious start to our day.  Yum.   "
7055506,168996384,2017-07-11,125782542,Rachel,"Lovely, thank-you!"
7055506,171191217,2017-07-17,10106347,Clara,"Under the vines was truly amazing. A location that's central to everything nothing was more than 10-15 mins drive away. You get a well appointed home with plenty of amenities to keep you comfy. The house is tucked away in a little vineyard and the backyard faces a pretty spectacular view. I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast spread that Karen stocked up in the pantry and the fireplace kept us warm throughout our stay. Make sure you lounge in the outdoor beanbags with a blanket, a hot cuppa and a good book. "
7055506,171842987,2017-07-19,138490745,David,"Such a great location and atmosphere. It was a cold wet time we spent in the Barossa, but the warmth and coziness of the wood fire and interior made it so welcoming and comfortable. The little details and effort really made it for me, like extensive fresh and local breakfast ingredients supplied, fireplace built and ready to go, tv and entertainment, and detailed easy to read information about everything in the area. Will definitely be recommending to friends who stay in the Barossa.<br/>10/10!"
7055506,173797337,2017-07-24,123639081,Chris,"We had a fantastic stay at Cottage in the Vines. We loved the local produce provided for breakfast, the wine and other lovely touches that made our stay so memorable. A perfect place for a weekend in the Barossa.  "
7055506,176880642,2017-08-01,52270472,Amanda,"Karens house was DROP DEAD BEAUTIFUL! You're minutes from 30 different wineries, from the shops and restaurants, and just dream like country drives. I highly recommend renting a car so you're able to drive around. Karen leaves several taxi and shuttle information so you can spend a day safely traveling between the wineries. We will definitely be back!"
7055506,190299860,2017-09-04,147602175,Teresa,We loved our stay here. Karen had thought of everything we could possibly have needed. My only regret is that we didn't stay for longer.

7055506,202105363,2017-10-10,50608012,Mark,"My partner and I visit the Barossa often and throughly enjoyed our stay.  We loved being amongst the vines and appreciated the fireplace on a chilly evening.  Karen has thought of everything, especially for breakfast.  And the place was immaculately clean.  We highly recommend the cottage and would definitely love to stay here again on our next visit to the Barossa!"
7055506,203304179,2017-10-14,28273990,Kate,"Had a fantastic stay here! It’s a very comfortable house, well set up, and a beautiful spot amongst the vines. We enjoyed being able to relax outside in the sun during the afternoon. The provided breakfast food was great with both cooked and non-cooked options. Would definitely recommend to friends!"
7055506,204789116,2017-10-20,14620343,Susie,"We stayed at under the vines with our 18mo toddler and had an excellent stay! It is a great location, close to wineries & barossa towns. We loved hanging out in the back yard overlooking the vineyard. Thank you!"

She really has thought of it all - anything you've forgotten she's probably provided a spare! Kitchen stocked, comfortable beds, amazing bath. Delicious breakfast and coffee (although my barista skills didn't do it justice). If this place is available for your dates then I highly recommend booking it while you can!!!"
7055506,219169513,2017-12-16,156689418,Olivia,"Thanks so much for being a great host, really appreciated the quick communication. Loved the little touches of candles and matches, amazing coffee, beautiful breakfast also provided. Easy to relax in, and so easy for day trips out. Thanks so much. We will be back."
7055506,223155441,2017-12-31,23507738,Charlie,"Would have given a 6 stars if there is an option to it.<br/><br/>Karen's place is well situated in the Barossa valley with almost every major vineyard & attractions less than 10mins drive away. With a vineyard just right outside the house, one can enjoy their meals/drinks at the backyard while enjoying the vineyard views. <br/><br/>And if u enjoy cooking, do look forward to a well stocked full kitchen & the fresh food supplied by Karen for breakfast.<br/><br/>I must say, to have a full Barossa Valley experience, one would have to stay at this place to complete it."
7055506,224956479,2018-01-04,160941945,Chen,"This is the best airbnb house I stayed so far! Karen has gone extra miles to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This is a lovely house in the vinyard, with thoughtful touches of welcome candies, fresh food, tour information, etc. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to travel to Barossa."

7055506,230297522,2018-01-27,17903140,Michael,Excellent comfortable and well equipped accommodation in a very peaceful location. A former commercial building has been remodelled by the owners as a stylish modern apartment that is genuinely situated amidst the vines.
7055506,230753700,2018-01-28,22826679,Thanh,Karen was really prompt with communication from the beginning. The accommodation is located in close proximity to all the wineries and other attractions in Barossa Valley which was really good as well as the fact that it's in the middle of a vineyard!!! It was such an experience to stay right in the midst of growing grapevines! We wished we could have stayed for longer. Everything was well laid out for us and Karen provided us with amazing breakfast and so many options such as juices and different types of milk!! Air conditioning in every room provided us with so much relief during 43 degree heat days and were on when we arrived. There is a spa and also a tv in the bathroom :) what an experience!!! Karen and  co. thank you so much again for your amazing hospitality. Definitely choose this place if you're heading to Barossa Valley to maximise your experience!
7055506,231180798,2018-01-31,169377445,Anthony,"Really great place to stay - it's very cosy, the breakfast, tea and coffee that were provided were great, and the bluetooth speaker had really good sound which was a bonus!"
7055506,233279364,2018-02-09,14514102,Kerry,"We loved Under the Vines - the photos really don’t do it justice.  I don’t know many places where you can sit in the back garden next to growing vines.  All the little touches made our stay extra special - the chocolates on our bed, the beautiful breakfast supplies (it really was next level) and the ability to check in and out early/late.  This place is great and Karen was delightful.  I highly recommend it."
7055506,234477682,2018-02-12,69163926,Nicholas,"Fantastic stay.  Facilities, location and easy of dealing with Karen just made the stay even better.  highly recommend"

7055506,238992943,2018-02-27,172624653,Stephanie,Karen’s home is a lovely getaway in a gorgeous setting w a vineyard. Two bedrooms make it good value for two couples or a family. Short drive to shops and restaurants. Karen left is some ingredients for a breakfast cook up too - so lovely and thoughtful!
7055506,239695928,2018-03-02,117568125,Chris,"Convenient place to base yourself for the Barossa, lovely being surrounded by the vines!"

The cottage, the grounds and location were superb, but what we loved most were the unbelievably thoughtful touches - fresh bread, local coffee, bathrobes. Just awesome. Thanks for thinking of everything, Karen!"
7055506,251429905,2018-04-08,44124489,Aimee,"Under the Vines is the perfect Barossa getaway! While we felt secluded in this location with plenty of privacy and quiet, it was only a 5 minute drive into Tanunda which was perfect. We enjoyed a lovely afternoon in the sun surrounded by the vineyard enjoying local cheeses and wines. <br/>Karen is a great host, super prompt with all communication and the little touches left around the place were so thoughtful! <br/>Our group consisted of 2 couples and this place was big enough that we never felt like we were in each other’s way. <br/>We would recommend Under the Vines to anyone looking for a Barossa Valley experience!"
7055506,253555655,2018-04-15,108675499,Nicole,Karen was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
7055506,254740269,2018-04-18,33000424,Ken,"A beautiful little house, perfect for two couples, great for just the two of us, handy to both Tanunda and Nurioopta. Karen has thought of everything for her guests’ comfort and enjoyment. We’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s here and overseas but none that could match all the little touches Karen has added. Five stars plus another for Karen’s communication and enthusiasm."
7055506,255258053,2018-04-20,3557083,Ros,Fabulous place to stay - clean & cosy with lots of lovely touches. Great location... Secluded but central!

7055506,262152127,2018-05-08,25045712,Qing,"This was our second time staying here. We absolutely LOVE coming back here - the view of the vines is spectacular and Karen really has everything stocked up around the house. It’s all about those little touches - like the local produce for breakfast that she arranges and the local coffee beans. The place has everything you need. It’s so tranquil and secluded but is centrally located so you’re still a short drive away from all the wineries, supermarket and local restaurants and cafes. Can’t wait to come back! :)"
7055506,268398299,2018-05-25,161503967,Luke,Lovely cottage and a very accommodating and hospitable host :)
7055506,275415276,2018-06-11,83822950,Jude,"Karen is an outstanding host, who thinks of the little things to make your stay extra special, from the bowl of Minties on the table, to candles next to the spa. We loved an evening walk through the vineyard and curling up in from of the fire. This is definitely a place that we will come back and will happily recommend to others. "
7055506,279519914,2018-06-21,6564369,Clare,"Thoroughly enjoyable mini escape thanks Karen, we look forward to returning. Loved the location, spa bath, wood fire, brekky goods and your local tips. Perfect winter holiday! We appreciated the porta cot being available also, cheers! "

7055506,288019803,2018-07-09,22340075,Ruby,"I would highly recommend staying at Under the vines B&B, the place is perfectly located to explore the Barossa valley and is set on a beautiful vineyard. The place was clean and had everything you could think of including a spa, tv, Foxtel, and lovely kitchen. It is the perfect place to relax after spending the day wine tasting and eating!! Karen also sent us a fantastic list of wineries and restaurant recommendations which were much appreciated!!"
7055506,294304344,2018-07-22,42815486,Kristina,The property is set in a vineyard and a little bit out of Tanunda town centre. It is perfectly located for touring the Barossa. Karen is a fabulous host supplying the most amazing breakfast provisions of local produce and setting the fire ready to light in the wood stove upon our arrival. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
7055506,298026311,2018-07-29,52254076,Max,"This is our second stay at Karen's, as we simply had to come back after our first stay was far too short.  This cottage is easily the best we have stayed at in airbnb; Karen is very generous and has everything you could want to have a comfortable stay.  The wood fire and large spa bath was particularly great for our winter  visit. Absolutely lovely, and definitely recommended. "

Breakfast goods were the best quality as was the port and coffee. Loved every second and wanted to stay forever. This is the place to stay in the Barossa, with that personal touch and vineyard feel ❤"
7055506,309842252,2018-08-19,199117923,David,"Under the Vines is an amazing place to stay, being close to Tanunda. Set on a working vineyard, but so quiet and peaceful with great views. The fireplace in winter is awesome whilst sitting on the lounge and enjoying the surrounds. A great comfortable 2 bedroom place to stay, with a large modern bathroom, with a spa and large double shower."
7055506,312143737,2018-08-23,98342081,Ian,"Beautiful stay in amongst a working vineyard. Clean and quiet with great amenities, beautiful spa and a wood fire heater. It is equal distance to both Tanunda and Nuriootpa but also away from the traffic and very relaxing. Highly recommended!"

7055506,336084129,2018-10-14,17740875,Chris,"Beautiful place nestled amongst the vines, secluded yet very central and close to everything. Great place for two couples or two friends. Karen was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout... also very quick with communicating. There were lovely touches with chocolates and also a large amount of breakfast supplies. Unfortunately we didn’t really take advantage of the fresh ingredients left for a hearty big breakfast. Would definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks again Karen."

7055506,343801343,2018-11-02,218374693,Gareth,"Beautiful place. The building looked small from the outside as you would expect for an Airbnb guest house, but inside its so spacious. The beds and the bathroom are big! Spa bath and double shower are both a treat. Breakfast kit was left in the fridge which was so nice! Wife and I might come back just for the Airbnb.<br/><br/>Only downside is, as mentioned, the bugs. There are quite a few spiders and centipedes and all so if that's a deal breaker for you, be advised.<br/><br/>Definitely would recommend"
7055506,354463628,2018-12-01,71439249,Saranya,"Karen's B&B was a perfect retreat in the Barossa. The two rooms had large beds and ample linen and towels. The bathroom is very large too and is perfect for couples. We had a delicious breakfast daily consisting of fresh vegetables, eggs and bacon with fresh bread and oats. The little touches around the place with the barrel of port make it very divine! Dinner and breakfast with the view of the vineyard made our stay extra special. Would definitely come back !"

7055506,598358693,2020-01-26,93068153,David,"Such a beautiful location to spend any special occasion with a loved one, or even just to escape for a few days. <br/><br/>Even though you are a little further out of town, it was 100% worth it to be amongst the vines and such beautiful scenery. Plus taxis weren’t too expensive, and close by. <br/><br/>We will definitely be returning to Under the Vines in the future!"

7055506,662484485,2020-09-10,13516628,Michelle,Amazing place. Loved the setting. It’s just off a fairly main road but you’d never know. It’s little like being in the middle of nowhere. We had one night and wished we’d stayed two. Beautiful place for a romantic getaway with a spa and fire. Karen was easy to communicate with and the extra touches where brilliant. First place I haven’t had to use my own candles in the bath. Lovely. Breakfast was plentiful and fresh. Thanks for everything.

We saw kangaroos hop through the vines at dusk and it's easy to find, but feels a million miles away from anywhere. I truly memorable spot to celebrate my birthday and I hope to get back there soon!<br/><br/>Karen is prompt to reply and eager to assist in local recommendations, if you need. The breakfast provision were lovely and the spa bath is definitely a highlight!"

7055506,758609603,2021-05-16,994655,Joanne,"Karen’s place was just fabulous.  There was so much to enjoy and two days barely gave us sufficient time to both enjoy the house and the Barossa Valley.  The location was perfect and the surroundings were beautiful.  Karen is a wonderful host, very responsive and thoughtful. The breakfast provisions were delicious and such a treat. The house is as good as pictured and more!  Karen’s extra touches were everywhere and really welcoming and made us feel incredibly relaxed from the moment we arrived.  Thank you!"

7055506,761226907,2021-05-23,50263298,Amy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Under the Vines. Karen really had thought of everything for our stay and left a lovely welcome message and breakfast, coffee etc. The fire was a treat and we felt so cozy in the evenings. It's so quiet around the property and it was just what we needed escaping the city. Taxis are easy to order to go into Tanunda or we walked one morning for a country stroll and took 45 minutes. Or a 15 minute cycle into town. If you're looking for a country escape surrounded by vineyards, I highly recommend Under the Vines!"
7055506,763959191,2021-05-30,118266253,Kay,"It may be an unprepossessing former cellar door on the outside, but inside it has been converted to a comfortable, well equipped and nicely decorated cottage with some amusing quirks. It is attractively located in a quiet vineyard, handy to Tanunda. With a cosy log fire on cold winter’s nights, a functional kitchen and a bottle of Barossa red we had two relaxing and pleasant nights here. Nice brekky supplies too. Karen has done a great job and furthermore is a helpful and attentive host. We had a delightful stay."
7055506,766412406,2021-06-05,216552735,Hayley,"The perfect place to stay in the Barossa!<br/><br/>We celebrated our 10 year wedding anniversary at Under the Vines and it was perfect from start to finish. Lovely personalised touches that made us feel welcome, generous brekkie provisions that catered for our dietary needs were spot on and the cottage was so well equipped. There were so many ways to get cosy and warm and the peace and quiet was divine. Karen was so easy to deal with and her communication was top notch. We would absolutely recommend Under the Vines and would happily come back given the chance :)"
7055506,770335627,2021-06-14,41515144,Caroline,We really enjoyed our stay at Karen’s cottage. It was peaceful and conveniently located in the Barossa Valley. We appreciated how clean the cottage was when we arrived. We also appreciated the quality breakfast provisions. Karen was super responsive and pleasant to deal with.
7055506,390816459013873009,2021-06-23,76082164,Grant,"A reasonable Airbnb and it is clear that a lot of effort has gone into it fixing it up. To us it didn't feel very homely - perhaps a bit more like a hotel room with a lot of mod cons, which there's no doubt some people would enjoy. It is surrounded by vines and also very close to a large shed - the hosts make it clear that there could be workers in the vineyards nearby at certain periods of the year. Well provisioned but we didn't feel it was good value for money."
7055506,395155378957324637,2021-06-29,191814828,Penny,"A beautiful place to stay and in a fabulous location! <br/>Perfect for 2 couples, with spacious rooms and 2 exceptional bathrooms! <br/>Karen was a great host providing lots of lovely touches;  from the generous supply of towels and bathrobes, chocolates, coffee machine, spa, open fire and a fridge stocked with local produce for breakfast(s) - we couldn’t have asked for more!<br/>We certainly plan a return visit, when we need more wine 😉 🍷<br/>Thank you"
7055506,403914415659447384,2021-07-11,112613172,Afrulla,"The perfect accomodation for our weekend getaway amongst the peaceful vines.  A cosy wood fire warmly welcomed us into a beautiful well equipped and very clean cottage.  A perfect location for enjoying the surrounding wineries and only a 5 minute drive to Tanunda.  <br/>Thank you to our friendly and thoughtful hosts for going above and beyond with utilities and amenities, from the comfy bed to beautiful bathroom(with good water pressure), yummy full breakfast supplies including bread from the local bakery and delicious Barossa coffee!<br/>We would highly recommend this accomodation for your next getaway!"

7297171,45221243,2015-08-31,23689788,Tim,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kathryn and Johns place over a long weekend in August. We were made to feel very much at home and they were very helpful with questions we had. They were so generous to  offer to take us to a local wine show which was one of the highlights of our trip. The house is an old classic with high ceilings and lots of room. The room itself was large, the bed was very comfortable and it had stunning views out over the acreage and some vineyards. The property is in angaston, a pretty little town in the barossa valley which is a short drive to many surrounding vineyards.<br/>Would recommend to anyone looking for a more authentic experience when experiencing the barossa valley."
7297171,47001240,2015-09-14,43720748,Marcus,Kate and John are very welcoming and friendly.<br/>They've good knowledge of the local area and the winery's located around the Barossa area. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed my stay with them felt like part of the family. <br/><br/>Will definitely stay again when I'm back in the Barossa!<br/>

I would highly recommend it!"
7297171,49539464,2015-10-04,45049317,Teresa,Glad we found this beautiful home to stay in. Jonathan and Kate were very welcoming and allowed us the use of their home as if we were long time friends. Their home is close enough to stroll into the main street of Angaston and still be surrounded by picturesque vineyards and hills typical of the Barossa. We'd love to return.
7297171,49949064,2015-10-07,42895481,Emma,"Staying at Pembury Homestead was a delight. The hosts were friendly and warm, conversation flowed with ease and the facilities extremely comfortable. Definitely of a high standard (I slept wonderfully) and the location picturesque. The resident dogs were friendly. I'd return again in a heartbeat. An all-round positive homestay experience. Thank you for having me!"

Because we were there for an overnight stay only, and had to leave early the next morning, we didn't get a chance to properly explore the area. Maybe next time. Thank you for having us."
7297171,52450010,2015-10-29,12006404,Vanessa,"We really enjoyed to stay in Jonathan's house - it was great! Our room was lovely, cozy, spacious and clean. Sharing kitchen and bathroom was never an issue. Jonathan even made the barbecue place ready for us and we could enjoy our dinner in a wonderful garden with marvellous views! Jonathan and his wife were great, easygoing and charming hosts! They had plenty of good advices for us. They have to dogs: An older quiet one and a younger wild one. Even if he jumps up on you he will not harm you. Both are friendly dogs. Angaston itself is a small and lovely village that we liked very much. There is a good butcher, cheese store, bakery and café. Angaston is well situated to explore the barossa valley. We would definitely come back - we felt really comfortable!"
7297171,52602342,2015-10-31,41122217,Amy,"We had an enjoyable stay at Jonathan's place. Jonathan and Kate are very friendly. The location of the house is quite convenient. There are few supermarkets and restaurants around the area. The room is very spacious, comfortable and clean. We had a great time exploring in their backyard to find their alpacas and sheep. I will recommend Jonathan's place to everyone who wants to spend a night in  Barossa Valley. Thank you Jonathan and Kate."

We were very fortunate to get all the travel recommendations from him. <br/><br/>The place itself is antique as Barossa and fully equipped with everything the travellers would need. <br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend the space to anyone heading up to Barossa/Eden valleys or surrounding towns.

Our room was spacious, with a beautiful outlook and comfortable bed with lovely linen. We enjoyed relaxing in their formal lounge. It was a treat to see inside of a beautiful old farmhouse like theirs. <br/>The share bathroom was not a problem. The location is very handy to eateries and wineries. We specifically wanted somewhere close to the Barossa Farmers Market, so this was perfect. Thank you Jonathan and Kate for sharing your lovely home with us. "

We had the run of the beautiful house and gardens, our toddler could play with the dogs; altogether it felt like a home away from home. The location of the house is perfect to explore the Barossa and surrounds. Shops are a short walk away and Jon recommended several great wineries. His Barossa Taste Sensations wine tour was fantastic and I can recommend it highly to discover hidden gems of wineries! Thank you for making our holiday memorable and we'll definitely be back.<br/>Leena and Alex"

Their property was like a country escape; it felt cosy and safe, and the room and facilities were clean. Jon was very knowledgeable about the region and recommended excellent wineries to visit. Angaston centre is just a 5-10 minute walk where there are great cafes. There is a neat biking/walking track very close to the property which would be perfect if you were keen on biking around town or travelling town to town. I would highly recommend Pembury homestead for your next stay in the Barossa valley. "

They shared an evening meal with me and even took me to meet friends of theirs one evening for pizza.  Great time!  The house is old and has a lot of character which I liked.  Very quiet area which is perfect if you want some peace and quiet.  They have 2 dogs but the youngest one is the one you'll see most and he is very playful.  Jon and Kate are great hosts and are more than willing to share information about the Barossa Valley.  I would most definitely go back and stay with them again if given the chance.  Thanks to both of them for a memorable stay.

7297171,66226016,2016-03-20,26001604,Simone,"Jonathan and Kate are very welcoming hosts. They have to lovely dogs (and livestock). Contact was comfortable and very interesting. <br/><br/>The room is spacious with high ceilings and very complete (desk, small sofa, tea maker, closet and of course a bed). The bed was reasonably comfortable, but if your partner is tossing and turning this could shake you up quite a bit. We could also make use of the lounge across the hall, with a very homey atmosphere a large sofa and a tv set (we did not try this) and some touristic brochures. It seems the hosts have their own living, so we had this room to ourselves. You can use the coffee maker in the kitchen and store your supply in the fridge. We had our dinner and breakfast in the garden, which is a very romantic setting. <br/><br/>It's a 10 minute walk to the village center with a restaurant, a supermarket and other shops and the like. On Saturday morning there is a farmers market one village down, good to stock up before you head further North. <br/><br/>The place is clean and a pleasant space to be. "

Their home is in a wonderful location- very close to Angaston- and was even more beautiful than expected. We spent some time chatting with them in the evening but they were very easy going and we would have felt comfortable enough to do our own thing if we wished. As our time in the area was very limited the tips that they gave us made this short time very special. We would definitely recommend a stay with Jonathon and Kate.
7297171,70461854,2016-04-17,11833720,Maria,"Jonathan and Kate have a brilliant home with lots of character. They were very friendly and engaging with great local advice.

After going out for dinner, we returned to the house & were invited to join them & their friends around a bonfire. It was such a great country experience. I would recommend this place to everyone, we had the best stay! Such a comfortable bed too - had the best nights sleep. Thanks so much Jonathan & Kate!"
7297171,84828974,2016-07-09,19309533,Catherine,"We loved Jonathan and Kate's homestead in the Barossa and it was the highlight of our accommodation in South Australia.

Situated right in the centre of the Barossa it was a short drive to most places and you can even walk down to Angaston. Communication before we arrived was great. Jonathan and Kate are very friendly hosts and we enjoyed our time there very much.

We highly recommend them for their hospitality, cosiness and Jonathan's great advice on wine (the reason why you go the Barossa in the first place, right?). :-)"

7297171,220567035,2017-12-23,152104390,Joy,"Pembury Cottage is a beautiful relaxing and homely environment, decorated simply, but so stylishly. Every room had such lovely charm. We felt at home and relaxed with hosts who were able to detect our need for some conversation but also recognised our need for time out and space. That is quite a skill. We loved riding around the Barossa on our bikes and coming home to the gorgeous kitchen to cook in with all the necessary things at hand, or wander down the Main Street in Angaston and eat out at a restaurant. The relaxed nature of the holiday in an area like the Barossa meant we could do as much or as little as we wanted and either was great. You will not be disappointed. Pembury Cottage and its owners take the guess work out of whether you will have a good time...all you need is here, the rest is up to you."
7297171,224381419,2018-01-03,7156496,Jr,"Very nice and communicative hosts with a nice space in the heart of the Barossa valley. Although it was a short stay, we benefited greatly from the wealth of local knowledge that Jonathan and Kate shared with us.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"

Their drive is literally on the bike trail which takes you all the way to Gawler. If you choose to do the bike ride there is nothing better than getting back for a shower and hitting Angastons restaurants ( 5min walk), then taking a bottle back to the house and chilling out overlooking the hills for the rest of the evening."
7297171,237963790,2018-02-24,158186525,Alan,Pembury Cottage is very tastefully furnished. Bright and contemporary. Excellent for restful stay and we’ll positioned for tours of Borossa Valley. Angaston a great little town

Both Maryann and her husband have great tips about which wineries to visit in the area so make sure you ask them!<br/>The house is lovely, comfortable, spacious and warm (and so clean).  I have to make special mention of the very very comfortable bedding!<br/>Even though you're sharing Maryann's home,  she doesn't impose herself on your stay and the space provided is very private and secure - you can have as much or as little interaction as you please.<br/>My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.  Maryann even had cheese, olives and chocolate waiting for us :)  I'll be back next visit to the Barossa.  Thanks again Maryann."

There was only one thing I wasn't a huge fan of and that being that the accommodation is at the front of their house and there is just a sheet up in the hallway separating the accommodation from the hosts but didn't hear a peep from them.

8053447,576612449,2019-12-14,19205007,Dale,"Maryanne’s place was much more than we expected. Super classy, clean and even though it is connected to the house, you feel completely private and seperate in your holiday oasis. It is a short walk into the town centre which is a great way to slow down the pace and enjoy Tanunda. We had the perfect anniversary night away!"

8153197,46985046,2015-09-14,1823405,Trudy,"Upon arrival Christa greeted us with the key, showed us around the attached cottage and then presented us with a hot freshly made orange cake ! A country welcome indeed.<br/>This is an old cottage which is attached to the main farm house, but is self- contained.  It has it’s own entrance and when you sit on the verandah at the back your view is of a field of vines.<br/>The bathroom is huge and old fashioned, but the water is hot with good pressure.<br/>The kitchen does not have a stove, but has an electric frypan, in which you can fry your fresh farm eggs which they give you.<br/>When we went it was cold, so it was lovely to sit around the log fire which was set up for us.<br/>Everything was very clean and we had a most enjoyable stay of one night.<br/>"
8153197,48758671,2015-09-28,42358141,Junshuo,Lovely stay ! Thank you for your hospitality.
8153197,49476578,2015-10-04,25316342,Anna,"Gorgeous property, Christa was a great host and left us beautiful breakfast supplies each morning and a fire set-up for the evening.<br/><br/>Had everything we could've wanted.<br/>"
8153197,56157973,2015-12-09,39503528,Fiona,"Spacious and comfortable, it was very hot when we were there but the cottage was nice and cool.  We got to enjoy a thunderstorm from the verandah and watch the galahs enjoy it. Christa was very generous with food supplied. Great stay."
8153197,58175375,2016-01-01,4795539,Alex & Dina,Christa was the perfect host! Very welcoming and friendly. The house is very spacious with a nice terrace overlooking the vineyards. Christa left a bowl of berries freshly picked from their garden on the kitchen table and shared their handmade paté with us! Just delicious!! Lovely experience - a great spot to spend time in Barossa Valley. 
8153197,59315692,2016-01-09,39654927,Jim & Kathy,"Naimanya cottage was a fantastic stay. A good location close to all the wineries. Comfortable and serene. Definitely would go back for more. <br/><br/>"
8153197,60486481,2016-01-24,4984577,Kristel,"Loved our stay, Christa and Leon were lovely, really enjoyed morning visits from their beautiful dog Rusty."
8153197,63220657,2016-02-21,8251594,Benjamin,"We'd recommend Christa's place to anyone looking for cozy, low key accommodation. We stayed three nights with our 11 month old son and felt right at home. Everything was clean, well looked after, thoughtfully prepared, comfortable and incredibly welcoming. <br/><br/>The location is fantastic on top of the hill, with easy access to amazing wineries and local eateries a short drive away.<br/><br/>The breakfast foods that Christa supplied were all high quality, local products, including beautiful eggs from her own chickens.<br/><br/>We enjoyed checking out the chickens, sheep and bulls grazing in the paddock and our son absolutely adored their very excitable dog, Rusty.<br/><br/>Thank you Christa, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and appreciate your hospitality at this very busy time of the year for winemakers."
8153197,65014459,2016-03-10,6361710,Thom,Staying at Christa's unique farm stay was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had! Christa and rusty went out of their way to make us feel at home immediately. We can highly recommend it for a unique Barossa experience.
8153197,65767701,2016-03-17,11669008,David,"The cottage is a beautiful little place on a farm/vineyard outside town.    Sitting on the back porch and having breakfast watching the sun rise over the vineyard was one of our best memories of the trip.  It's a little bit of a drive to the big winery areas but no big deal and a scenic road for the most part.  Owners are wonderful and very nice, gave us lots of recommendations about the area and things to do, and of course about wine!  Breakfast is included but is ""cook your own"", Christa gave us a nice assortment of local eggs, bacon, bread, coffee, etc and we made our breakfast on our own schedule.  Kitchen is small but adequate, no real stove just electrics.<br/><br/>The house itself is cute but very old, like 1860's old.  The owners live in the other half of the building which is one of several additions to the original house.  If I had any complaint about the place it's that the bathroom probably dates to shortly after the invention of indoor plumbing.  Perfectly usable and not an issue for us, but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing it's the only complaint I have.  We would definitely consider staying here again if we're ever back in the Barossa Valley."
8153197,66044545,2016-03-19,54428481,Rita,The host made us feel very welcome.Friendly and accomodation was much larger than I expected.Good sized rooms Beds very comfortable.Well equiped.Beautiful views and so close to 2 small towns with excellent eateries.
8153197,66870876,2016-03-25,11768376,Grant,"If you don't feel you would enjoy peace and quiet in a wonderful location, waking up to birdsong at sunrise straight out over vineyards from you verandah, wonderful hospitality with fresh breakfast produce (outstanding local bacon, eggs etc), then this may not be th place for you!! As for us we wish we had more time to enjoy the area and hospitality shown by our hosts and would hope to return again when next visiting from the UK."
8153197,73914075,2016-05-11,63030976,Lynne,"<br/>Great place to stay, large airy rooms, lovely open fire and the view over the Vineyard is charming. Christa is a welcoming and generous host, setting the fire every day and making sure all provisions are stocked up. It was blowing a gale on one of our days and Christa had thoughtfully put the heater on soo when we arrived back cold and damp it was lovely and warm "
8153197,74556308,2016-05-15,9860797,Billy,"Great location with easy access to vineyards and towns of the Barossa region.Lovely setting on a working farm,complete with adorable kelpie.Christa made us feel very welcome with a well stocked kitchen and fridge,which was replenished daily.Lots of information about local attractions from Christa herself and written material.The cottage itself is cosy and  comfortably accommodates two couples.Would love to visit again and stay longer."
8153197,83523829,2016-07-03,24771774,John,"We had a delightful stay at Naimanya Cottage. The Cottage was just as shown in the pictures and about a 10-15 minute drive out of Tanunda. Access to vineyards and other Barossa attractions was all pretty easy. Being on a working farm/vineyard added to the charm. Christa was an excellent host - great with communication about the booking, and gave us really good directions on how to the somewhat remote cottage. She provided bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, milk, cereals, tea, coffee, fruit, fresh bread etc each day. We had an open fire each night was a real winner!   We would definitely stay here again."
8153197,86408313,2016-07-16,9252024,Colin,Thanks Christa for the opportunity for a quiet and relaxing holiday. The cottage was very clean and the fridge well stocked with all that was needed for a hearty breakfast. We used the open fire every day and appreciated the continually replenished supply of wood.  
8153197,91352557,2016-08-05,77398488,Lynda,"I wanted a quiet place to relax and the stay at Naimanya provided exactly that. The provisions were great and we wanted for nothing. Included was a lovely german cake. While it was slightly off the beaten track it was only a short drive to some of the best restaurants and attractions. Having a fire set up for the evening was great, there is nothing nicer than a warm fire to end the day."
8153197,95692426,2016-08-20,65289886,Dace,"We loved staying at Christa's B&B. A simple but very charming place; warm and cosy with delightful views across a vineyard, garden and farmland. Christa was so easy to talk to you & supplied more fresh eggs, fruit, vegetables, bread and cake than we could eat. We'd recommend it to anyone."
8153197,99383690,2016-09-04,21228651,Steve,"Christa was very welcoming and accommodating, we had a very secluded and relaxed break at Naimanya Cottage. "
8153197,102322401,2016-09-17,82368434,Kylie,We had a lovely stay here. The weather held for us so we got to explore the Barossa Valley. Loved our fire each night that Christa set for us. More than enough provisions for breakfast. Felt at home. Lovely and private. Highly recommend and would definitely come back. 
8153197,103622667,2016-09-23,6248547,Amanda,"Naimanya cottage was a gorgeous country homestay and set the scene for the perfect experience in the Barossa. Christa was a wonderful host, filling the kitchen with delicious local produce for breakfast and everything we could ask for. The cottage was very spacious and cosy we couldn't recommend staying here enough. "
8153197,109649625,2016-10-22,46356706,Alison,"A wonderful place for a much needed rest and quiet getaway. Christa's attention to detail was impressive, and we (a couple with 7 month old baby) were made to feel most welcome.  Amazing how restorative a couple of nights in front of the fire with a glass of wine can be!"
8153197,115766150,2016-11-26,72409954,Wendy,"Thank you Christa for a very relaxing stay in your beautiful cottage.Views soothing.Abundance of goodies in the fridge and on the table,couldn't fault a thing.I was reluctant to light the fire as it was set so attractively but couldn't resist.Forget to tell you how lovely your flowers arrangement was."
8153197,124079169,2017-01-01,9974434,Amelia,"My husband and I had a perfect 5 days in the Barossa staying on Christa's wonderful farm and vineyard. We appreciated the fresh breakfast provisions, locally sourced (some from the farm!) every morning. Thank you Christa for sharing your home with us. Close to everything yet isolated with a lovely view over the Riesling grapevines."
8153197,133991191,2017-02-25,88644249,Louise,"The perfect place to stay to dip your toe into the Barossa. The place is quiet and feels secluded, and Christa's food supplies help to whet your appetite! We had a lovely weekend - thanks again for your hospitality."
8153197,138467871,2017-03-19,54807865,Hui Lan,"We love Christa's property. It is close to The Barossa but away from the main town. The property is full of character. We love the fresh eggs and tomatoes that Christa provides from her farm for brekkie. Rusty, her pet dog, is extremely friendly. Everyone make us feel very comfortable and welcomes us warmly."
8153197,145348629,2017-04-17,110232644,Katie,"You won't be disappointed when you stay at Christa's b and b. Christa is a wonderful host, provides fresh goods for breakfast which many are replaced daily. The eggs are from her own hens 😀. The views are to die for and there is so much wildlife! The shower is easy to access as you don't have to climb into it and the toilet is sort of separate around the corner in the bathroom! So someone can use the toilet while someone else uses the shower which is a great system. There is a national park about a 10 min walk when you turn right out the property which has LOTS OF KANGAROOS hoping around, eating, but make sure u go an hour before sunset to see them. The property is in easy reach of every where in the barossa and sepplesfield has a beautiful drive down to it with gorgeous trees. Highly recommended this place 😀"
8153197,149194567,2017-05-03,124203095,Erin,"The house was perfect!  It was clean and the area was quiet and relaxing.  Christa provided all of the makings for breakfast every morning.  We had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend it.  We didn't have a car so taxi fares into town were quite expensive so our only recommendation is if you are staying here, have use of a car.  Great value for money!"
8153197,159905310,2017-06-12,60577275,Nick,"Thank you for having us Christa, Erin and I had a lovely break staying at Naimanya. The breakfast was delicious, and having the fire made each day was a nice touch. <br/><br/>There is plenty of room and bedding, so its good to know we will be able to bring the kids next time!<br/><br/>We loo forward to coming back for another stay sometime soon! :)"
8153197,168110713,2017-07-09,55089013,Alice,"Christa was an amazing host. Stayed up really late when our flight was delayed so she could let us in and give us a tour of the house. Provided a wonderful fresh breakfast each morning and cleaned the place during the day when we were out. The house is a beautiful old cottage, with a great fire place and heating in each room. Christa even cooked us some beautiful apple slice on arrival, and left a gorgeous bottle of shiraz for us to enjoy with dinner.<br/><br/>Would recommend staying here to anyone wanting a quiet stay, close to wineries. We will definitely be staying again.<br/><br/>"
8153197,205298746,2017-10-21,27986773,Amy,Christas place was exactly what we were after. I would definitely stay here again and the small thoughtful touches were great. We were left with supplies for breakfast by either grown on the farm or local produce. We felt at home and loved being on a farm away from Tunanda and Angustown. Both towns were not far and definitely worth exploring. Gorgeous area and a great location in the Barossa. We only stayed 2 nights but I recommend 3-4 nights.
8153197,210982204,2017-11-12,27079629,Colleen,"Christa's place was in a fantastic location, out of the main towns but still only a 10 minute drive away. Christa's knowledge of the area certainly came in handy when planning our day and the Rolf Binder Riesling that was left for us in the fridge was delicious.<br/><br/>And what can we say about breakfast. It was so good! Eggs from her farm, delicious bacon, homemade jams and breads. She certainly went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing stay. Thanks again Christa!"
8153197,218083608,2017-12-11,42948187,Meryl,The Naimanya cottage is absolutely stunning. It has impeccable views with a cosy cottage interior. The location is perfect as it offers a quiet country stay whilst only being 10mins away from main areas. <br/><br/>Christa is a wonderful and generous host. The best Air BnB host we've ever had! Definitely a place worth requesting!
8153197,220803052,2017-12-24,62125476,Martha,"We loved staying at Christa’s! From the beautiful cottage, amazing views, and thoughtful touches, you will Not be disappointed with this delightful place!"

Great hospitality, local produce left daily, great host, a beautiful kelpie, annie, and all the time in the world. I loved that we could do so much, or so little, it was very relaxing in an authentically old world atmostphere. Thankyou christa"
8153197,235772946,2018-02-17,2096660,Janet,"This is a wonderful country retreat, with exceptionally warm country hospitality. Christa was a wonderful host and we will definitely be returning, again and again."
8153197,243991982,2018-03-17,14505174,Megan,"We absolutely loved staying at Christa's! We were with another couple for the weekend, visiting the Barossa Valley - and could not have picked a more picture perfect place to stay. <br/><br/>Her house is clean, historic and beautiful. It overlooks a the rolling hills of the Barossa and Eden Valley. Christa herself is a winemaker - so some of the grapes on her property are used in wines you may have the opportunity to try! <br/><br/>She was extremely helpful and responsive on check-in, and even though we were visiting in the middle of Vintage (busy season) she still made time to give us a tour of her family winery.<br/><br/>Keep in mind - the house is up on a big hill (hence the awesome views) so if you're doing a tour you'll be about a 10-15 min drive to a lot of the wineries near Tanunda. <br/><br/>We loved Christa's place and would definitely stay there again the next time we visit the Barossa! <br/><br/>**she also has the cutest Kelpie puppy called Annie!"
8153197,251383053,2018-04-08,9495305,Leigh,"Christa was an amazing host - plenty of thoughtful touches and genuine consideration about our stay and experience. <br/><br/>The cottage is historic, and could do with some small touches to make more user-friendly e.g. larger sofa in lounge room, comfy chairs on the deck for afternoon vino. <br/><br/>All in all we felt very looked after and loved our time in the Barossa. Thanks Christa!"
8153197,262459249,2018-05-09,63325540,Ruth,"A quiet, rural outlook, which is very peaceful.  I would recommend it to all.  Christa was a great host."

8153197,266292706,2018-05-19,50176105,Otto,This was the perfect space to explore the Barossa Valley and had a beautiful view! The host was very helpful with recommendations for exploring the area and supplied us with yummy farm foods.
8153197,268094948,2018-05-23,45319315,Elise,"Christa is a fantastic host, the cottage is a nice escape from Tanunda, located in a lovely quiet valley - fresh brekkies everyday and equipped with everything you need."
8153197,280692662,2018-06-24,72938971,Hamish,We had an incredible few days in the Barossa and very much enjoyed our stay with Christa. We were after an authentic Barossa experience and couldn’t have been more pleased with the cottage. Drinking wine by the open fire in the evenings was just what we needed after a big day touring the vineyards. By staying with Christa you not only get access to a great cottage but she is also a well renowned winemaker only too willing to share her knowledge of the region. A great experience. We’ll be back.
8153197,326687536,2018-09-23,69465389,Shane,"We can highly recommend a stay at Christa's cottage. Staying on the farm which is within easy reach of the Barossa and Eden Valley's (10 mins) , provided us with a very relaxing experience. <br/>Our hosts Christa and Leon were very helpful and friendly. The cottage had provisions for a full cooked breakfast with fresh farm eggs. The open fire in the lounge room also created a lovely atmosphere.  A raised veranda offers fantastic views of their vineyard and surrounding farms.<br/>There are plenty of walking trails in the area for those who want to experience the native wild life and bush land.<br/><br/>Shane & Marianne"
8153197,331900884,2018-10-04,43817014,Rachel,"My partner and I spent 3 nights at Christa's place and had a wonderful time. It's a cozy, old cottage with a lot of character and a beautiful view over a vineyard. Christa was friendly and welcoming as was Annie, the Kelpie! The breakfast provided for us to cook was fresh and it was fully restocked each day. The location is at the top of a hill so the drive to the vineyards takes a little extra time, but we didn't mind because the views descending into the valley were beautiful. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
8153197,336086016,2018-10-14,13939675,Oliver,"Would highly recommend. The cottage is in a beautiful location overlooking vineyards, is rustic and provides more of an authentic Barossa experience. Christa the host is extremely friendly and responsive she also provided a ton of extras which made the stay even more pleasant incl fresh ingredients for breakfast each morning, the fire made up each day and wine from the local vineyard. Would definitely stay again! Olly"
8153197,338942147,2018-10-21,190033476,Fiona,"WOW! what an amazing cottage. Beautiful views, excellent host and the most relaxing environment. Christa is a brilliant host. Will definitely be going back for another relaxing weekend in the future."
8153197,342545908,2018-10-28,161686635,Maddie,"We enjoyed our short & sweet stay at Naimanya, the cottage was undeniably spotless, clean and well upkept. It was a cool experience to stay in a building dating back to mid 1800's! The country setting was peaceful and only a 10-20 minute driving distance of Angaston and Tanunda. We loved Annie the dog's cute little visits when we were outside. We appreciated the included breakfast provisions that were restocked everyday. The cottage was attached to the family home, and has been modernised with touches of a pump pressurised shower of rainwater, reverse cycle, wifi, and heat lamp in bathroom; which was a cool setup in itself with toilet in the same room but concealed in the corner at the same time by an original wall. The lookout off Tanunda creek road not far from residence was awesome at the time of sun-set.<br/>😊🌞"
8153197,345751336,2018-11-06,3316167,Jemi,Christa's bed and breakfast was fantastic. Many nice touches throughout our stay and an amazing location to base ourselves. We also managed to taste some of Christa's wine and were fascinated by her story. Thanks for a beautiful stay!
8153197,400683388,2019-01-12,24684920,Daen,"We really loved our stay here! Christa was a great host and was very accomodating. We especially loved the home grown eggs, bacon, fresh juice and milk in the fridge on arrival."
8153197,430592825,2019-03-31,5200343,Lou,"We had a wonderful weekend in Christa’s cottage, thoroughly enjoying ourselves. It’s such a gorgeous place and Christa is a wonderful host. We especially loved her tour at their winery. We just loved the fabulous brekkie provisions, the wine and the thoughtful touches with sage and figs from the garden when we said we were cooking that night. Thanks again. Lou xx"

8153197,457315201,2019-05-24,33529141,Candace,Had a great stay at Christa’s cottage. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets over the vineyards gave us some gorgeous pictures. The cottage was comfy and the breakfast provisions were generous and yummy. Definitely check out the wines produced from the vines on Christa’s property. They were beautiful as well.
8153197,483886512,2019-07-08,11278387,Michael,"Thank you Christa for being a wonderful host and looking after us on our weekend stay in the Barossa! The house was quaint and lovely, with a huge roaring fire every night and delicious fresh local produce to cook up a storm with. Mornings and evenings on the veranda were a highlight. We had a ball, highly recommend!"
8153197,558348873,2019-11-02,183037414,Rosalie,We loved our stay with Christa. Her home was a great base from which to explore the Barossa. We loved all the thoughtful touches including the fresh bread and eggs she delivered each day.

8153197,628079808,2020-06-07,66395483,Amelia,"Great little stay, away from it all but not a far drive to wineries and restaurants. We loved the location and the fire place. Christa had it all set up ready to go which was such a nice touch. Great breakfast selections as well for the morning and she gave some great tips on things to do in the region. Highly recommend and would stay again."
8153197,637027589,2020-07-12,62168879,Jozefien,Lovely place with nice little touches. We had a great time.
8153197,639672403,2020-07-19,57997969,Mads,It's a wonderful cottage taking you back in time. The views out the back were sensational. And those cookies...wow

8153197,665950813,2020-09-20,154634897,David,Christa’s place was perfect for our weekend away. Great balcony overlooking the valley and the cottage has everything we needed for a really enjoyable stay. Terrific coffee and great range of breakfast provisions. Christa is a thoughtful and friendly host and her cottage a great base to explore the Barossa
8153197,669273479,2020-09-29,218575887,Jason,"Thoughtful touches, great local produce and very clean<br/>Thank you!"

8153197,721804588,2021-01-03,122762566,Peter,"Spacious and comfortable place to stay in a good rural location for touring the region.  Christa is a very generous host, providing us with a good supply of fresh produce and even some great wine from the farm's vines."
8153197,747248157,2021-04-10,29775082,Fay,"Naimanya is a rare find if you are looking for a quiet, relaxing place in country Barossa Valley that is still close to towns and wineries. It is very special to sit on the verandah in the evening and watch stars appear while not seeing lights from neighbours anywhere. The cottage itself is charming and comfortable and Christa keeps the fridge well stocked with delicious breakfast supplies and we enjoyed Christa’s complimentary bottle of local wine."
8153197,748589910,2021-04-14,239912173,Allison,"Christa was a fabulous and thoughtful host who provided everything we needed, including delicious breakfast provisions. Fresh flowers were in every room and a delightful bottle of Rolfbinder Reisling was ready for us on arrival. All of this and a beautiful view of the Flaxman Valley. Thank you Christa."
8153197,753851826,2021-05-02,242224157,Sarah,"Christa provides very generous breakfast provisions as well as some delicious local sweet treats, delicious bread and a lovely local white wine.

8153197,761220062,2021-05-23,359579669,Corey,"Great little cottage with a great view from the back deck for breakfast.<br/>As others have also said, the breakfast and snack provisions are plentiful and thoughtful. Even many gluten free alternatives for my partner.<br/>While we did not find this an issue for our stay, the cottage is attached to the main house. It is also a working property so there were several workers there in the daytime during our weekend stay. If you are looking for complete seclusion and privacy, this might not be for you.<br/><br/>Highly recommend the short walk to Flaxmans Wines around the corner, the wines are great and so is Gus!<br/><br/>Thanks Christa, we had a lovely time during our stay and enjoyed our visits from Lilly."
8153197,765780012,2021-06-03,346145028,Richard,"We booked a last minute trip to the Barossa and we’re so glad we found this listing! The place is full of authentic, old world charm set on a lovely property a few kms out of Tanunda. The cottage was very comfortable and spacious with adequate heating. There were ample breakfast provisions and the home made cookies and bottle of wine were a nice touch. Views out from the back verandah were amazing and we enjoyed a little wander around the farm. Highly recommend."

8616563,121173432,2016-12-14,23035964,Jan,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8616563,126049786,2017-01-08,52987608,Mark,"Kym and Steve are amazing hosts. We required an on-the-spot booking, and were more than happy to accommodate. Instant responses whenever we had questions which was a very big help.<br/><br/>As the description states, the beautiful home keeps its Circa 1890s feel with its layout and decor, with the added bonus of a modern kitchen and spa facilities.<br/><br/>The short walk to the main street was also very convenient.<br/><br/>Perfect for travelling families."
8616563,136018371,2017-03-07,108742998,Trina,"Kym's place felt like home. It was centrally located but in a quiet location. It had everything we needed. It was clean, described perfectly and was beautifully decorated. We loved it. "
8616563,168679968,2017-07-10,4200939,Krystal,"This place is amazing - everything you could possibly need & more! <br/>We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and can't recommend it enough, so homely and comfortable. Close to the main street (Murray Street) but still quiet...a great place to stay to relax & enjoy everything that the Barossa has to offer."
8616563,172430819,2017-07-21,115606146,Brigitta,THANKS for a wonderful stay. True to its name we had fantastic night of indeed treasured memories. Will definitely be back and hope for an even longer stay next time. <br/>Brilliant place wonderfully presented and prepared. 5/5 stars.
8616563,193777965,2017-09-15,148739918,Jacqueline,"Quaint cottage close to great food, shops, and wineries!"
8616563,198291285,2017-09-29,150085184,Matthew,"Great place, great location. Was awesome to be able to bring pets. Had to go through one bedroom to get to another, which was not made clear. Wifi wasn't set up as advertised but this was fixed on request."
8616563,204391560,2017-10-18,38197407,Melissa,"We have stayed at this house before. It’s really close to the Main Street so we were able to just wander up the road and grab breakfast or supplies from the supermarket.<br/>There are supplies of juice, milk, tea, coffee and cookies provided, which is incredibly handy.<br/>There have been more air conditioners added since we stayed there last which was great since we had some very warm days during our stay. <br/>The last time we stayed, we only had one child (14 months old), this time we had 2 children (3 & 16 months old) who like to get into everything. I don’t think we realized how much antique type furniture was in the house. It’s probably not really a toddler friendly house from that regard."
8616563,216009005,2017-12-02,3190183,Rosie,"A lovely house in a very convenient location. We didn't meet Kym as we arrived at night and were attending a wedding. However, the house is spotless, comfortable and close to shops and restaurants. There was milk, juice, tea and coffee and biscuits  available for us when we arrived.The garden is very pleasant and we enjoyed our stay there very much."
8616563,221539080,2017-12-26,159699508,Liz,Treasured memories is so cute and lovely - takes you back! Such a lovely place - will stay again if we have the chance. Thanks Kym for the thoughtfulness throughout!

8616563,421609356,2019-03-10,134354337,Kathy,"A quaint old cottage, nicely fitted out with some lovely antiques.<br/>The bed was very comfortable with crispy clean sheets, nice.<br/>Pet friendly status is always a must for us, good secure garden, but sadly the garden itself is a bit neglected. <br/>Kym was very pleasant to deal with, prompt communication from booking to check out. Very helpful when we had a last minute addition to our plans. <br/>Thank you very much Kym."
8616563,490011819,2019-07-18,90558263,Jessamine,It is a quaint cottage in the old nostalgic style. Near to shops & main road.
8616563,496798164,2019-07-28,168845290,Peter,Clean and tidy place with many beds in the centre of Tanunda. No faults and very comfortable. Would recommend
8616563,616166272,2020-03-09,283599378,Christin,"Great location, very clean and great communication. It’s quite an old place though, very dark and only one bathroom."
8616563,638272424,2020-07-14,132335377,Andy,The house was nice and in a great spot in Tanunda; walking distance to the Center of the village. We had our small dog with us and the garden in the back gave her some space to roam.
8616563,721255133,2021-01-03,152299671,Emily,.
8616563,740810276,2021-03-21,8591558,Kristen,"This accommodation is located perfectly in the centre of Tanunda - so only a short distance from shops, cafes and restaurants and an easy location for taxi's to locate. <br/>It is a large house - which we didn't even use 1/3 of it. The air-conditioners were all running on arrival for temperature control. <br/>The bedding and linen is quite basic. The yard is not 100% pet friendly due to incomplete fencing so bring long leads for outside time. There is a small park across the road for frequent visits to stretch the legs. <br/>Overall, a positive stay - location, location, location."

9264671,67451484,2016-03-29,19869505,Ashley,"This place is exactly as described - basic (small studio, no TV etc) but has been recently renovated, is clean and modern. Very short walk to the town/shops. Tracey was really helpful and easily contactable when we struggled to initially find the place! She also left us handy things we needed over the weekend (milk, coffee, wine!) The studio can be a little bit noisy if the main house is booked as (I think) the studio is next to their kitchen/laundry."
9264671,68858071,2016-04-07,19500087,Charli,Barossa Seasons Studio is a great rest stop while enjoying the surrounding Barossa Valley. The room is a fair size with a comfy bed and large bathroom. The only trouble is finding the place but Tracey came to the rescue and explained how to find it - it's quite easy but just needs a house number displayed.
9264671,101908891,2016-09-15,94894707,Alison,"Tracey was a lovely host! Very responsive and helpful. The Barossa Seasons Studio was a compact living area which was clean, comfy and cosy. I would recommend to anyone to wants to visit and stay in the Barossa Valley for a couple of nights. It very close to the shops, restaurants and cafes just as decribed. Thanks a bunch Tracey!"
9264671,106194735,2016-10-04,23843380,Nathan,Tracey was a wonderful host. The studio was perfect for a couple to use as a base to explore the Barossa and a short few minutes walk into the centre of town.

9264671,137666255,2017-03-16,380707,Joshua,While Tracy was not there to let us and she made it very easy for us to access the unit and when we had a small problem she came right over. For us the large bathroom was the highlight of the unit. She provided several dinner recommendations and in the morning we were about half a kilometre from several breakfast options.
9264671,139508666,2017-03-25,21067935,Manda,Great room! Walkable to everything in Tanunda and a great base for exploring Barossa
9264671,147295551,2017-04-26,66410927,Rowena,We enjoyed our stay thank you Tracey. The accommodation had all we needed and more for our stay. We especially appreciated the hair dryer and the complimentary bubbly and cheese on arrival. The room is on the main street  of Tanunda but there is almost no traffic at night and the convenience makes up for any noise. This is a great spot and we loved our stay in Tanunda.
9264671,151688417,2017-05-14,124503604,Geetha,"Clean but very basic.  Only has bedroom and bathroom, small amenities area.  No where to actually sir.  Chairs outside and not very useful when cold.  Expected a little bit more for the price."
9264671,153404740,2017-05-21,67841802,Emily,"Lovely gem which I was so happy to find. Everything was effortless and Tracey wasn't lovely to deal with.

She offered us an upgrade to the Marble Room from our original Idyll Studio booking. The Marble Room is in a stunning sandstone house with a large master bedroom, comfy lounge room with Netflix access, spacious bathroom, and a dining room stocked with continental breakfast, bubbly and strawberries. Wifi was also available. <br/>The property in walking distance to the town's cafes, shops and restaurants.<br/>Tracey even gave us tips on where to eat and visit in the Barossa! <br/>Fantastic experience."
9264671,282273305,2018-06-27,4517641,Jane,"Very tiny studio with no place to sit except the bed. Would be better in summer with the use of the outside space. Very good location, clean and comfortable bed."

9319994,426348880770777417,2021-08-11,413264390,Terry,"This is a fabulous place to stay in Tanunda. We absolutely loved the decor, the fire and the location. The big window in the lounge (the one on the website) was fantastic. Loads of birds came to sit in the tree outside including 2 kookaburras, magpies, murray magpies, wattle birds and there were two ducks that visited in the back yard. The beds were all super comfy & cosy. Loved the bubbles & nibbles in the fridge. They were a lovely welcome. Tracey’s communication was A1. Loved the huge towels & very clean bathrooms. All the bespoke mid century woodwork throughout is magic. You’ll love it here."

9319994,479207055849845989,2021-10-23,72203069,Julia,"Barossa Idyll was an absolute dream to stay at! The house has a cool 60s throwback vibe, full of mid-century pieces. Great location, plenty of bedrooms, bright and spacious, multiple bathrooms and a great kitchen to cook in - perfect for families and groups of friends. The view is idyllic, with rolling hills seen from inside the house, but the real luxury was stargazing under the clear night skies with the warmth of the fire pit and some Barossa Valley Shiraz in hand. Tracey was the perfect host, great communication and she even provided a welcome platter for our arrival. I’d recommend this place to all and stay again in a heartbeat!"

Two living and dining rooms with ample seating, a lovely front and backyard to watch the sunset and sunrise. We were in awe of the view from the huge glass living room looking across the landscape. Cafes easy walking distance and the house was spotless. The house is a very cool 1970s timepiece yet so modern. Everyone enjoyed a great night sleep. Thank you Tracey"
9453124,101351889,2016-09-12,5101334,Monica,"Barossa Seasons is the prefect house for a family or a large group, especially if you want to cook at home. It is so well appointed. Tracey has thought of absolutely everything you may need. The view from the back of the house is lovely, it is really close to the shopping strip, has parking for multiple cars. There is a lot of internal living space, good quality furniture, large bedrooms with plenty of really clean linen and it is well heated.  Netflix and wireless internet, and outdoor furniture and BBQ. It was great and Tracey responded quickly to any requests we made. "
9453124,166240546,2017-07-03,492501,Caitlin,We loved our stay at Barossa Idyll in Tanunda.

9453124,752753792,2021-04-28,85557119,Liz,"We absolutely loved our stay at Tracey's place in Tanunda, we were a group of 7 traveling together for 4 days of wine touring in the Barossa and this house was perfect for us. We booked it initially because it offered more bathrooms than most other options but for a great price. The house was so comfortable, it was perfectly warm (the weather was quite chilly during our stay) and we had the option of the fireplace inside or the fire pit outside. The kitchen was really well equipped and the bedrooms were spacious and comfy. The location was perfect, we could walk up the road to restaurants each night for dinner or coffee in the morning, but from the backyard there is a gorgeous view across the valley, you feel like you are staying out of town away from everyone. Would definitely recommend and we will be back!"
9453124,404537820453982739,2021-07-11,27820065,Rachel,Wonderful spacious accomodation that was faultlessly clean and tidy. Perfect location and easy to find. Highly recommended by all of us!

9714178,71470894,2016-04-25,24458055,Laura,"Our stay in the Barossa Valley was fantastic, largely due to the phenomenal accommodation in Tanunda. The pictures honestly do not do this home justice. Not only does the decor look like you stepped into a page of Architectural Digest, Yvette is the master of ensuring her guests have every amenity someone could need when away from home with friends (a full kitchen with a nespresso, iron, hairdryers, umbrellas, playing cards, DVD player...the list goes on). The home was more than comfortable for four people (it could easily fit 6); the large outdoor area adds to the immense space already offered. To top it off, the home is less than a 5 min walk into town (3 min to the grocery store) & all of the vineyards we visited were no more than a 15 min drive from the house. Yvette was also incredibly kind and responsive with any questions I had. If I visit the Barossa region again, I will most definitely make a point to rent this home again!"
9714178,87012033,2016-07-18,29426940,Jisue,We stayed at Yvette's place in Tanunda for 3 days and 2 nights for a friends 30th birthday weekend getaway with 6 friends. Yvette's place is absolutely beautiful. Everyone was blown away by how nice the place was when we arrived. Every single corner of the house was amazingly clean and all the appliance and furniture - pretty much the whole house was luxury. Thanks to Yvette we were able to have a delicious breakfast 2 mornings in a row. The fridges and cupboards were stocked with food! The complimentary wine and appetisers were amazing as well. Thank you Yvette for the beautiful house. We all had an amazing time! We will definitely be returning to this place when we come back to Barossa Valley!!
9714178,104821436,2016-09-28,29965545,Jeff,Great cottage 
9714178,106949228,2016-10-08,2004690,Stacey,"This accommodation definitely exceeded our expectations and made our stay over our wedding day absolutely amazing!<br/>It was like a home away from home - a high end home at that! Everything was thought of and the produce supplied upon arrival was fantastic. <br/>Yvette was very effective to communicate with and we had no issues with checking in or out. We just wished we had stayed longer!<br/>The location is perfect and close to everything on the main street and the house itself is immaculate - very modern and well finished renovations. Thank you so much for a very memorable stay!"
9714178,110017740,2016-10-23,23830566,Marietta,"Sometimes photos don't sell the story well enough, the photos couldnt show you just how fantasticly comfortable this place was. Spotlessly clean, best spot next to a couple of good restaurants, everything you need in the kitchen, including espresso machine.<br/>Highly recommend this to anyone, nothing disappointed."
9714178,125259867,2017-01-04,1678638,Jennifer,"Yvette's place is wonderful! The property is beautiful, new and perfectly maintained. There's great outdoor space for lounging and eating with friends. There were so many thoughtful touches - like the sound system, the breakfast food that was included, the espresso machine, etc. The house is completely fitted out and a pleasure to stay in. The key code access makes check in really easy as well. This is definitely the best Airbnb in Tanunda."
9714178,185143947,2017-08-21,24174632,Kellie,"This place is absolutely stunning!  <br/>3 bedroom, 2 bathroom stunning cottage just out of the centre of Tanunda.<br/>The house itself is very clean, really well provisioned with breakfast and on arrival we were greeted with some wine and cheese!  There is a coffee maker there with George Clooney style Nespresso Pods in generous portions - which is great as we did struggle to find a good coffee in town!  Everything we looked for was there, from a cheese board, to wine glasses, a cooler bag and a cold pack in the freezer for a sore head!! Hehe.<br/>The bathrooms were also well provisioned with excellent, very strong, professional standard hair dryers, exfoliating mitts, and bath salts amongst all the other standard things.  In the laundry there was laundry powder and basic cleaning equipment if needed, as well as a washer/dryer.<br/>The styling in the house and out on the patio is exceptional, so if you are into design, this is the place to go!  We walked away with some lovely styling ideas for our own homes.<br/>To get everywhere:<br/>3 minute walk to a cafe.<br/>5 minute walk to Ferment Asian (You MUST go there for a Chef's menu meal)<br/>3 minute walk to centre of town.<br/>Walking and riding distance to many many wineries.  This location is great for 3 couples or a family."
9714178,189495930,2017-09-02,114459613,Luke,"What an amazing place. It felt like stepping into a Home Beautiful magazine shoot! Absolutely everything was PERFECT. Yvette was an incredibly responsive, attentive and accommodating host from the moment we booked. The place itself was immaculately presented and spotlessly clean. The attention to detail in the way the place has been furnished and appointed is beyond impressive. From the instructions on the light switches to the labelled Tupperware I really cannot think of one thing they could do to improve on the place. The eggs, bacon, bread, wine, olives, dried fruits etc left for us were also as good as you could possibly get. Literally everything about this place was perfect. I could not recommend staying here more highly. We hope to be back as soon as possible!"
9714178,224667208,2018-01-03,8053791,Ana,This home is very special. Best location and so stylish. No expense has been spared in fitting out this home. We loved everything about it. wish we could have stayed longer!

9714178,268744190,2018-05-26,35171808,Glenn,"We stayed for a week in Yvette’s B&B in Tanunda.  We loved every minute of our stay.  The house is perfectly situated in Tanunda to allow ourselves and our friends to walk to all of the towns attractions, returning to warmth and comfort of the B&B when required.  We could not fault the house, the decor or the amenities provided.  We had three couples staying for the week and found there was plenty of room for all to stretch out and relax.  Highly complimented by our guests and highly recommended by us.  A great location to base yourselves for visit to the Barossa. "
9714178,277234860,2018-06-16,39328864,Alex,"Couldn’t rate Yvette and her house more highly. She was very responsive with questions in the lead up, the place was gorgeous, so many lovely touches, delicious breakfast, and perfect for our one year old too - portacots, high chair, and even bath toys at the ready! The location was the perfect distance to the centre of town and also very central to all the wineries and other towns in the Barossa. We had terrible weather all week yet still had a wonderful holiday as we enjoyed our time in the  house so much, on the comfy leather couch in front of the fire! If you go to the Barossa, you should definitely stay here!"

The ducted air-conditioning throughout was a real boon in some extremely warm weather. The only reai negative is whilst it is situated within walking distance of shops and restaurants it fronts on to a busy main road that light sleepers may find traffic noise can be intrusive.
9714178,505119188,2019-08-09,106774239,Geoff,"Perfection! The house is stunning and exceeded every expectation. Luxury, comfort and every convenience. Yvette was an A+ host.

9714178,518328997908224533,2021-12-15,310353675,Felicity,Yvette’s cottage is absolutely beautiful. Within walking distance to town and close proximity to many wineries. The cottage is beautifully decorated and Yvette has thought of everything even things we didn’t know we needed! The breakfast provisions were substantial and kept us going for days. A bottle of bubbly and cheese platter was a lovely surprise. Thoroughly recommend.
9714178,528450506541837510,2021-12-29,73254679,Lou,The most amazingly appointed historical home with absolutely everything you need and more. Simply sensational. Am booking for longer next time as we just didn’t want to leave.
9714178,530715213361250795,2022-01-02,58949990,Matthew,"Yvette's cottage is absolutely stunning. A beautiful place that can accommodate three couples comfortably. The bathrooms have been renovated to provide a beautiful modern touch which gives a very luxurious feel.  Beautiful bathroom soaps, moisturisers, shampoo, conditioners, baht robes, towels, slippers --- what else can you ask for? The double beds are very comfortable with quality linen. The fridge and cupboard was stocked with bacon, gluten free macarons, mushrooms, butters,  jams, fresh eggs, spices, sugars and a wonderful cheese and fruit platter on arrival! NBN wifi access, ipad, board games if you have kids, toasters, fresh bread from the Apex bakery! All homeware essentials are there. It really was magnificent. Coffee pods, milk frothing machine. It really was an exceptional experience. We did not utilise the wonderful outdoor area but there is a bbq, lovely table and outdoor seating to accommodate a wonderful dinner experience with friends and family. We would stay again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended. Thank you Yvette !"

9850994,57176883,2015-12-22,21719584,Dee,"Jonathan was a superb host, incredibly welcoming & knew lots about the region. I chose Jonathan's place as a base to explore the Barossa Valley wine region, the room was elegantly decorated & the grounds were picture perfect. A hardware store close by hired out bicycles & Jonathan's place was right next to the start of the cycle track. I would recommend that if you stay at Jonathan's place to take advantage of the dining table outside as it is a great spot to enjoy breakfast in the morning, an afternoon tea or to watch the sunset behind the vineyards with a chilled glass of wine in hand. Just a point to add, Jonathan's dogs were really lovely too!"
9850994,58189545,2016-01-01,45082822,Emily,"Jonathan was a fantastic host. He provided clean, spacious, and adequate accommodation in a beautiful home, and was well aware of the surrounding areas, happy to share his knowledge with us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return."
9850994,58479410,2016-01-02,154390,Tanya,Great place to stay... Room was large and just like the photos. Jonathan was extremely welcoming and knowledgeable. We were thankful we could bring our dog. Highly recommend staying here!
9850994,59319796,2016-01-09,8404897,Ina,"Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt in meinem Prinzessinnen-Zimmer. Jonathan ist unkompliziert und herzlich. Ein tolles Haus für einen Besuch im Barossa Valley!<br/><br/>Thx Jonathan, I really enjoyed my stay!"
9850994,59432110,2016-01-10,665386,Frank,Jonathan was a great host. We didn't get to spend a lot of time with him or in the house but his knowledge of the area helped us out a lot discovering little gems in the barossa. Our room was clean and perfect with a big comfy bed that we would love to stay in again. Cheers Jon and thanks again. Frank and Ally
9850994,59595005,2016-01-12,16448034,Frank,"At the end of a long (and hot) drive from Victoria it was a welcome relief to reach Jonathan's home in Angaston and to enjoy his hospitality in this little oasis in the Barossa Valley.  The room was comfortable and well equipped but Jonathan gave us pretty much free rein over the rest of the house, including the lovely gardens and outdoor areas, not to mention the attentions of the lively Baxter.<br/>Unfortunately my wife fell rather ill on the first night of our stay and could not stray far from our room for the next 36 hours, but Jonathan was extremely empathetic and understanding and tried to make sure that she was as comfortable as possible.  His support was very greatly appreciated."
9850994,59662443,2016-01-13,25412423,Emmanuelle,Jonathan was friendly and welcoming host. We had a lot of room to ourselves. The place has a lovely backyard. It's walking distance from the village and near a walking/bike trail. A great place to stay in the Barossa Valley.
10285222,61127044,2016-01-31,40589598,Cameron,"Had a great one night stay in the Ruby suite. This is a one bed apartment attached to others, but is entirely self-contained with private access (including via code which was ideal given our arrival later in the day). Very spacious, with good cooking facilities, and very convenient given location to main street shops and restaurants - we walked to and from dinner out."
10285222,61689890,2016-02-07,27768238,Tess,"Lovely pool area & beautiful old house!<br/>The house is split into 3 or 4 AirBnB accommodations, this one is located at the rear of the house and it is very dark. <br/>You enter straight into the main room and off this there is a small bathroom and spacious kitchen.<br/>It has been some time since the property was renovated so it's looking a bit tired with water stains on the ceiling and bubbling on the plaster walls due to water damage.<br/>The bed was extremely hard, I actually used the cushions from the lounge to lay ontop of the bed as it was very uncomfortable. <br/>Loved the pool area but would recommend a Reno & new bed!! "
10285222,74598949,2016-05-16,34935405,Saya,"I don't have a bad word to say about this place! It was brilliant and very Cosey with a lovely kitchen, living space and a fire place as a bonus!<br/>Kym was great and very understanding and friendly despite us having booked this place literally last minute/ same day. She responded promptly and was very patient, and super accommodating.<br/>The fireplace was even set up so all we had to do was put a match on!<br/>The room was in a lovely old stone building with a few original features.<br/>Location was exceptional, right in town, in the lovely tanunda. <br/>I would definitely stay here again. Hopefully not too many people discover this place! <br/>Of note, accessing the keys was very efficient and check in was easy. <br/>Thanks again Kym! "
10285222,116828867,2016-12-03,21799867,Ryan,"A beautiful little apartment, fully equipped for an overnight or week long stay. Great location and great value for money"
10285222,129987442,2017-02-03,34334379,Vinh,Great location. Nice place to stay after a day of wine tasting! 
10285222,131310472,2017-02-11,31041400,David,"The location is excellent. An old home but quite nice. Would be lovely in winter with the fire or if you had time to use the pool. Biggest downside was the bed, two singles to make a double has a hump in it, but one side is rock hard. Sadly the worst bed I've slept in and I have 130 nights a year away from home. Otherwise it was excellent. "
10285222,198016721,2017-09-28,642178,Kerry,"We were disappointed, the place was dinghy and smelt of smoke.  If you're not a small person you will struggle to get behind the bathroom door to the toilet. The couch is at the end of the bed too close to the TV and you can't watch from bed as the couch is in the way. We found this way over priced and found other much nicer places to stay for much less cost."
10285222,221221894,2017-12-25,77626300,Jamie,"Good location, nice pool and bbq area, nice full kitchen with good quality appliances. Building is run down but only because it's historical. With this expectation in mind it was well worth the money."
10285222,614354024,2020-03-04,42174874,Laura,Great little AirBnb in the heart of Tanunda. Shame the weather wasn’t bright enough to make use of the pool. Very happy with our stay at Kym’s!
10285222,619751989,2020-03-18,188920172,Jackie,"Spotlessly clean and well equipped and easy walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. An old building so quite dark inside."
10285450,63415264,2016-02-22,57335368,Chelsea,"Memory Lane was a great place to stay at our time in the Barossa Valley.  It was withing walking distance to the main street of Tanunda. The booking process with Kym was very easy and even when I'd forgotten to call to check-in, Kym's team gave me a call and sorted everything out. They were very friendly and made the booking process a breeze."
10285450,73359095,2016-05-08,41321208,Natalie,"Loved this place! I took my mum up to the Barossa for Mother's Day weekend and Memory Lane was the perfect place for our stay, we didn't want to leave! I can't wait to come back during Winter time and make use of the open fireplace. A beautiful home with a lot of character in a great location. It's just like the photos!"
10285450,75428588,2016-05-21,54165858,Natalie,Place was absolutely gorgeous! Thoroughly enjoyed the spa bath too - perfect location for a Barossa visit :)
10285450,77233040,2016-05-30,59080268,Zarina,"The house was very comfortable and cosy. It was clean and tidy. We enjoyed our stay, the house was close to shops and wineries. <br/>We loved the fire place which came in very handy as it was quite chilly. Would definitely recommend to others. Thank you"
10285450,93341866,2016-08-12,41203137,Kathleen,Memory Lane was as described & pictured. Was a warm & comfortable place to stay after touring the Barossa in winter - the open fire was especially great after a cold day. We were 6 friends travelling & there was ample room for us all. Very handy location to the main street to be able to walk around town. The team was very easy & quick to respond to all messages. We enjoyed our 1 night visit. Would recommend.
10285450,103133910,2016-09-20,93120489,Amica,"Absolutely perfect for what we wanted, great spacious bedrooms, beautiful gardens and Bbq area. Any questions were promptly answered, check in was easy. The open fire was enjoyed with a port in the evening. Easy walk to the Main Street and all good restaurants. Will be returning. Thanks "
10285450,108317361,2016-10-15,69495179,Tamara,We loved our stay in Memory Lane. The place is very charasmatic with plenty of space for the 4 of us. Sleeps quite a lot of people though so we look forward to another visit with the rest of our family along perhaps. Lovely little outdoor spaces too to relax and enjoy the serenity.  <br/><br/>Walking distance to the main street so great location.
10285450,112277131,2016-11-05,13868505,Chris,"Kym's Memory Lane is the perfect home away from home. As soon as my wife and I entered the front door, it was as if we were returning to our ideal home. The dignified elegance, thoughtful availability of general food items and peaceful tranquility of the location made this our favourite place to stay in the Barossa Valley."
10285450,116834950,2016-12-03,31881946,Kristy,"Highly recommend. This is a lovely house in a great location, only a few minutes walk in to town and a<br/> short drive to some nice wineries. House was clean and comfortable and check in /out and communication all great. Suitable for families or a romantic couples getaway. "
10285450,122058270,2016-12-20,92413743,Susan,The location of this accommodation was absolutely ideal. The cottage was clean and tidy and we even got a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary!
10285450,124887455,2017-01-02,3488178,Dale & Gaby,"This house is very comfortable and has a lot of charm. It is close to everything but provides a peaceful and quiet retreat. We would recommend to couples or groups wanting a comfortable, well equipped and clean base to explore the beautiful Barossa region. Thank you! "
10285450,126426481,2017-01-11,57072813,Lynne,"The cottage matched up to the photos and the location was good but there was no wifi, I was told it was subject to availability, this had not been told to me when I booked, 2 days prior to arrival. I was told that it was available in cafes but as the time difference in U.K. was  11 hours cafe opening times were not appropriate for contacting my family with wifi which I am reliant upon for communication.<br/>I also presumed that the cottage was privately owned and not part of a tourism business. It did lack the personal touches which I've become accustomed to in the many other Australian airbnbs which we've enjoyed staying at."
10285450,131128819,2017-02-10,26658411,Andrea,Lovely little cottage within walking distance from all Tanunda's shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend!

10285450,134569171,2017-02-27,7272045,Rhiannon,"Great location, close enough to the main road for convenience, but far enough to be nice and quiet. Check-in was easy and the accommodation was comfortable."
10285450,141783835,2017-04-04,54560530,Krystina,Such a fascinating cottage. A history buffs dream. Such a welcoming home and the ability to bring our four legged friend with us was brilliant.

Comfortable lounge and beds, super clean, great homely kitchen, a HUGE relaxing spa bath and to top it all off for us.. dog friendly. We loved being able to stroll down the road for shopping or dinner (with or without the fur-babies) and the door to door service for our Barossa highlights tour,  just perfect! Thanks again for having us: Lisa, Michael, Henry & Charlotte"
10285450,545737507,2019-10-12,47728971,Dan,"Perfect location in the heart of Tanunda, makes exploring on foot or by car very easy. Peaceful location, with a nice outdoor area."

10287444,113988315,2016-11-14,89600870,Courtney,"Unfortunately our toilet got blocked twice which may be a reflection of the old plumbing - however, a plumber was sent out as soon as possible. The communication was great!  The shower head isn't the greatest and water got everywhere - there was no TV remote and we were really disappointed to find no wine glasses in the house. Otherwise we had a lovely stay and was right in town with great accessibility. "

10287444,207784924,2017-10-29,35350543,Gina,"Beautifully kept house right on the main street in Tanunda. We were a group of friends enjoying the wine regions after a work trip and this house was spectacular to explore. You very much get an historic sense within the home, however everything has been well maintained in the style of the house. Despite traveling in late October we still got to benefit from the fireplace on a chilly evening (quite a novelty for us!) Perfect location for enjoying the town and visiting local wineries."
10287444,216039329,2017-12-03,142106649,Nick,Clean and comfortable. Easy access to Tanunda township. Would recommend this accommodation.
10287444,216443961,2017-12-03,23018009,Philippa,This house is well located for visiting the Barossa. Unfortunately it smelt like previous guests had been smoking in the house.

No traffic after 10pm, it was really quiet. Plenty of heating, neat, tidy and clean. Off street parking, perfect for my workplace away from home with heaps of power points and spacious dining table. Loved the local truffle, thank you, the biscuits with a cup of tea making me feel right at home. Tanunda is a picture perfect and hospitable town. Thanks Kym and co. I'll be back."
10298152,102671498,2016-09-18,88181554,Kelly,"Central, clean, well equipped and quaint maisonette in Tanunda. Comfortable beds. Sweet addition to leave a dog toy and bowl (but we brought our own and would have preferred a bottle of Barossa wine ;) Large bathroom with spa bath (although some decent shampoo and conditioner would have been a nice touch). Good communications with the staffwho manage SA Getaways. Just felt it was rather overpriced compared to equivalent accommodation we have stayed in. Thought the additional charges for children under 10 years and for the dog (refundable deposit would be more fair) and for the wifi made it expensive and not great value for money."
10298152,133985706,2017-02-25,9374776,Lindsay & Tim,"Barossa Best is a nice cottage on the main street through Tanunda.

10298152,263763146,2018-05-13,105523418,Alida,Fantastic home in the middle of town. Highly recommend!
10298152,266992549,2018-05-21,278235,Vivien,"Location is amazing! Easy orientation to get to the different winery regions and on the doorstep (walking distance) to great restaurants, coffee and easily pick up groceries to cook in Kym’s well stocked kitchen! Thanks again!"
10298152,294261294,2018-07-22,201687463,Amy,Served our purpose wonderfully. Great location to eateries and shops in Tanunda. Amenities were clean and the touches of hospitality really made it an easy and enjoyable experience. Spacious rooms. Would stay again if coming back to experience wineries of Barossa. 
10298152,309827285,2018-08-19,37633976,Deanne,"Great find, cosy and welcoming, excellent location in town."
10298152,335324879,2018-10-12,208785382,Katrina,This is a delightful cottage that is perfectly located in the main street of Tanunda. It is an easy walking distance to great eating options and other amenities and has a great coffee shop right across the road. The booking process was easy and Kym made us feel welcome from the get go. The cottage is clean and comfortable. For winter it is easy to heat. The bedrooms are huge and the beds comfy and spacious. My only regret is that I didn't make time to use the spa bath in that great big bathroom -maybe next time. There's just so much to see and do in and around the Barossa and this was a perfect base.
10298152,405953016,2019-01-28,47291939,Kelly,"Kym’s communication, information and check in details were great. The indoor spaces were clean and perfect for 2 couples, and the location was within easy walking distance to shops and eateries. Outdoors could do with a good clean and also a tidy up (removal of old and seemingly unused outdoor furniture and plant pots in bad condition). <br/>NB this spot shares a front gate and front garden with another BnB immediately next door, and the back outdoor areas are adjacent. So, if you’re after complete privacy ‘Barossa Best’ might not be for you. <br/>If you’re not fussed by overhearing each other’s conversations and don’t mind sharing the front area then go for it!"
10298152,445271910,2019-04-29,165664375,Clive,Tanunda is a wonderful place to visit.<br/>Secret Garden is central and easy to walk to the best eateries in town.<br/>Car park under cover off the street at the back was great.<br/>Handy having the wine tour operator next door.
10298152,548168962,2019-10-17,2390743,Catherine,"Listing did not advise that there was an additional $25 pet surcharge, and I did not receive any communication about this until well after the 48hr cancellation window had elapsed. Was left with no other choice but to pay this fee or lose my full booking cost. Shame though as this is otherwise in a good location."
10298152,579989693,2019-12-21,7249671,Tracey,"This place is a perfect gem with plenty of character if you want to stay in Tanunda! Centrally located with a cafe across the street and a Restuarant a few steps away, it has everything you need. Loved the freshly ground coffee in the fridge, great touch!"
10298152,588649009,2020-01-04,22819468,James,"The Getaway team were great, responsive and made our welcome care free and really enjoyable. Thank you :)"

10298152,715062743,2020-12-13,33957175,Kerry,"Great spot, shared front yard which did not bother us at all but would be great for friends or family joint stays. The location for local Dining is excellent and Tanunda is a great place to locate yourself for a Barossa wine and dine weekend or longer."
10298152,726719061,2021-01-25,215136990,Kylie,Great place and location

10298152,532896230820196511,2022-01-05,426435318,Letitia,A charming place to stay right in the centre of town. Everything we needed within walking distance. Lots of space and enclosed parking.
10348508,90717586,2016-08-02,76512774,Claudia,"This house is in a fantastic location, walking distance to shops and eateries in Tanunda. Would suit two couples, family or a few friends on a get away. We loved the location, size and vibe of the place."
10348508,94062529,2016-08-14,86617877,Lisa,"Our host was very friendly and let us in to the property and showed us through. The property is very clean and well maintained. The central location meant an easy walk to shops and restaurants. we requested prior to arrival that beds be split and this was done with no fuss at all. The beds were comfortable, the décor was simple and stylish. We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Thank you so much Kym for allowing us to stay at your property. We will be back."
10348508,112362523,2016-11-05,12989830,Poppy,"Central spot in Tanunda, near to cafes and the pub! Clean, spacious and very nice supply of tea, coffee, milk etc. 2 massive beds and handy fold out sofa bed. Friendly, easy contact through agents next door. 'Secret' garden so secret we couldn't find it :) Thanks for a lovely stay."
10348508,115214795,2016-11-22,59047358,Sheldon,The listing and pictures were accurate.
10348508,126829815,2017-01-14,41967957,Rebeca,"The place was exactly what we wanted- central, clean and comfortable. Communication was excellent. I would come back again."
10348508,136022033,2017-03-07,106586404,James,"Amazing experience from beginning to end. House was much larger than I had anticipated, so there was plenty of room to spread out. Beautiful house in a quiet yet conveinient location.<br/>Will definitely use again!"
10348508,138720917,2017-03-21,71594200,Samantha,"Beautiful spot and the house was adorable.  Perfect for what we needed and the house so clean and set up with everything you'd need for a weekend away. <br/>Thanks for our stay kym, we had a wonderful time."
10348508,148493371,2017-04-30,43468377,Seona,"Great location, very clean"
10348508,187935738,2017-08-28,33951032,Margaret,"Perfectly situated right in the heart of the main street. We could walk to the pub for dinner, cafes for brekky and then head off exploring easily. But, in side the house, you wouldn't know you're right on the main street. Couldn't even hear the traffic at all! Would stay here again."
10348508,755248140,2021-05-05,231181059,Sam,Perfect location to walk around the towns cafe and restaurants. House was quite big and clean.
10619599,296483132,2018-07-26,46747172,Donna,"Kim's place is in the front and part of a large beautiful home on the main street of Tanunda, residential area.  Lovely garden in the front area. Very handy to shops, cafes & restaurants.  Beautiful high ceilings large rooms very warm & inviting.  Great place to stay & reasonably priced for Barossa.  Good communication & self-check in no problems."
10619599,708608144,2020-11-14,112624675,Lucy,"Place was lovely, great location and customer service. The garden outside the suite makes for a lovely atmosphere, especially in spring. I highly recommend this place for a short stay."
10634089,62443048,2016-02-14,1692419,Joy,"We ended up not meeting Kym because we were driving around the Barossa Valley, but we were able to check in via telephone. The process was easy and we used a code to get into our room. The suite is located in an old house which is divided up into 4 separate units. Bed was comfy, and the ac worked well. We could easily walk up to the main street and found several cafes open for breakfast and had reserved for dinner at the 1918 Bistro. Tanunda is a very charming town, and I wish could have stayed longer. <br/><br/>The swimming pool was nice, just a bit chilly when we stayed."
10634089,91804921,2016-08-06,86802733,Mark,The booking process was fine however the room was quite tired with a hotch potch of furniture provided and lacked any appreciable decor or theme. It had a lovely wood fire and an old inefficient  split system Air Con that couldn't keep the chill out of the room. Unfortunately the toilet was broken so in the end we decided not to stay the night. The room would probably be fine for most people but at over $200 a night there are probably better options around.  
10634089,100712094,2016-09-10,24780127,Jess,A cute place with charm and beautiful fireplace. The location was superb. Thank you. 
10634089,127919106,2017-01-21,25516646,Claire,"Excellent hospitality! Comfortable bed and situated in  great part of the area, we will be back."
10634089,142566113,2017-04-08,62572916,Wayne,"Comfortable and quiet suite, close to everything that Tanunda has to offer "
10634089,207804139,2017-10-30,2369659,Karina,"The room is quaint and well decorated. It has a full fridge and there are wine and champagne glasses available. It got a little noisy if other guests were sitting at their outdoor area, which is near the entrance to the room. Not having wifi for foreign travelers was a bit hard to stay connected and look up wineries to visit."
10947532,62635790,2016-02-15,2343373,Elise,"Super friendly, warm and helpful hosts who went out of their way to make our stay special. The property was even more beautiful than in the pictures and has some lovely surprises you don't get to see in the pics. The room has a leafy private courtyard and easy access to the lovely saltwater pool. Excellent breakfast provisions including gorgeous home made jams and marmalades and real milk with cream on the top. Great location for visiting wineries and restaurants. We couldn't have been happier with out choice, it's great value for the quality of the accommodation. "
10947532,63422447,2016-02-22,58434041,Anna,"The Stables proved to be the highlight of our (much too) short weekend stay in the Barossa Valley. The super talented hosts were exceptionally welcoming and delightful to chat with. The accommodation itself is a beautiful stone cottage with views of the gorgeous gardens which have been fertilised with hours of love. The personal-touches in each corner of the room have been perfectly balanced with the history contained in the walls and the modern-day amenities. Location-wise, it was ideal for visiting many wineries and restaurants. When we return to this beautiful region we will definitely be staying at The Stables again but for a much longer period, so we can explore all the hidden gems it has to offer."
10947532,64372522,2016-03-03,34805496,Gail,"Set within the Vineyards of the Barossa Valley this delightful retreat had everything.  Newly converted, the accommodation was comfortable and the hosts very friendly.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Stables and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mixing it with evening drinks on the riverside deck and enjoying the company of Tibbs the oh so friendly dog.<br/>"
10947532,64864446,2016-03-08,12312790,Phil,We really enjoyed our weekend getaway to The Stables.  The accommodation was perfect and we really appreciated the pool in the hot weather.  The hosts have the right balance between welcoming you and making sure everything is OK  but also allowing you some privacy to relax.  The setup of the building really works well.  We also enjoyed the many sculptures around the property and then meeting the artist was great too.  What a perfect place to explore the Barossa from.
10947532,66998639,2016-03-26,30128798,Stephen,"Just off the main road between Lyndoch and Tanunda is this sweet little farm and generous host. Really enjoyed the space, the garden, the pool and the company of Tibs the dog. Probably suits early risers as there occasional truck noises, rooster crowing and other country sounds. Kay is a real sweetie. "
10947532,67463580,2016-03-29,7389816,Georgia,The stables was the perfect place to start our Barossa adventure. The gorgeous stone cottage had all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. It was extremely clean and tidy and the hosts very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking past the vines to the wonderful riverside deck. The Barossa bike trail also runs past the back of the property which was great to walk along. We couldn’t have been happier with our choice. 
10947532,67646532,2016-03-30,25324655,Kellen,Wonderful visit. A tranquil setting in the middle of wine country. Lovely hosts!
10947532,68492173,2016-04-05,2839836,Hannah,"Kay was an excellent host, offering lots of assistance but also giving us privacy. The cottage was beautiful and just what we were after. The property was also great, with a beautiful deck to sit and read or have a glass of wine. The dogs were also a highlight. "
10947532,68541201,2016-04-05,28326804,Bernadette,"This place is beautiful! Kay made us feel very welcome and the little cottage was very clean and tastefully decorated. Very comfy bed and gorgeous bath! This place is in a great location for wine tasting, restaurants and golf! "
10947532,69709667,2016-04-12,60299042,Jessica,"From the moment we arrived at the Stables, Kay and Madeleine made us feel so welcome. The property is absolutely beautiful with lovely gardens, a vineyard, and quirky sculptures dotted throughout. <br/>Excellent attention to detail, with so many thoughtful touches: fresh flowers from the garden, bath salts, plenty of extra towels and linens on hand, and fresh local grapes to snack on.<br/>We slept very well in the quiet of the countryside and the bed and bedding were very comfortable.<br/><br/>The best part about the property were the hosts though. Warm and friendly, they were always happy for a chat but gave us complete privacy as well. <br/><br/>As far as the area goes, we felt very centrally located in the Barossa and had easy access to the bike path and the various towns.<br/>The location in the countryside can't be beat! Close enough to town to pop in for dinner but tranquil and relaxing for downtime.<br/><br/>We'd definitely stay here again.<br/>"
10947532,71259704,2016-04-24,42881435,David,"We both had a wonderful time staying at The Stables.   Our hosts were welcoming and the accommodation was wonderful, cosy, clean and well appointed.  It was just right for our romantic weekend away.  We loved the location and enjoyed everything our hosts provided.  The description of the accommodation was accurate and we were not left wanting anything.  Thank you to our hosts for such a great time."
10947532,71856007,2016-04-29,28167255,Tiffany,"Our stay at the Stables was a highlight of our trip to South Australia. The cottage is charming and well-equipped, surrounded by lovely gardens and vinyards. Great Barossa wineries and restaurants are a short drive away. Breakfast fixings were all delicious: homemade jam, apples off the tree, eggs fresh from the 'chooks'! Kay and Madeleine were wonderful hosts, offering advice for touring the area and making sure we had everything needed for a comfortable stay. "
10947532,72722784,2016-05-04,5728990,Sebastian,"Kay was a wonderful host and had great knowledge of the local wineries and most importantly, good coffee! The stables were a beautiful conversion and we had a wonderful time staying - can't wait to go back."
10947532,73310118,2016-05-08,29531092,Sarah,"We had a great weekend away at the Stables. Lovely, welcoming and personable hosts. The B&B was comfortable, clean and tidy, with a homely feel and lots of spots to sit and relax on the property. It is also in an ideal location. Highly recommended and would definitely come back. "
10947532,74457637,2016-05-15,45398521,Amanda,"We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome when we arrived late at night after a long drive in the rain! The stables is a beautiful place to stay, located perfectly near Tanuda but not in the bustle of town. The accommodation is everything and more that is shown on the website- I can't recommend staying here enough! We even were able to pick apples and pears from the trees just outside our room! "
10947532,75675388,2016-05-22,59992297,Philip,"We really enjoyed our stay, the cottage is very comfortable and Kay is helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a stroll along the bike/foot path to Jacobs Creek visitor centre, and wine and cheese by the river, with a fresh contribution from Kay's fruit trees! Would definitely return for a longer stay."
10947532,76141223,2016-05-25,36570331,Peter,"What a gem. Lovely accommodation in a 3 acre productive site with vines, chooks and their own produce. If you were looking for an organic place this would be hard to beat. Situated right on the Barossa cycle path but out of town it gave us the sort of access and freedom we wanted. Great bed by the way. Thanks Kay and Madelaine, great to meet you."
10947532,76823560,2016-05-29,10936810,Esther,"We had such a lovely stay at the Stables. Kay and her partner are lovely and very friendly. The place is spacious, clean and has a beautiful garden out the back. Would highly recommend this place and would love to go back and visit again. Perfect location for wine tasting in the Barossa."
10947532,78397768,2016-06-06,10138988,R,"Thank you Kay for a wonderful stay. Perfectly located as a base for touring the Barossa, was a gorgeous weekend and we both really appreciated your hospitality and tips!

10947532,80877867,2016-06-20,57988440,Madeleine,"Such a unique space. Lovely hosts. Gorgeous gardens, animals and river nearby. Couldn't have asked for more! Will definitely be back. "
10947532,82206192,2016-06-26,15002635,Daniel,"Kay and Madeleine welcomed us warmly (with a hug!) and showed us around the beautiful stables. The accommodation is spacious and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Their friendly dogs are a bonus! Big bath, comfy bed and even some CDs to set a relaxing mood. The brekky stuff was appreciated, as was the fruit and chocolates. A gorgeous spot, lovely hosts and magnificent surroundings. "
10947532,83490807,2016-07-03,17583101,Patrick & Ava,"The ideal Barossa experience! Kay's place has everything one could think of: beautiful decor, ideal situation, and comfortable living. The space is also thoroughly clean and in great taste, her hobby-farm has all the quaint fittings associated with the area, and to top it off, she is hands-down an excellent host! Highly recommended for all times of the year!  "
10947532,83868127,2016-07-04,24382073,Hazel,"Kay made us feel welcome on arrival and was on hand to help us with directions over the weekend. The Stables were immaculate and Kay provided a well stocked fridge with lovely fresh eggs. <br/>Perfect location for travelling to wineries of the Barrossa."
10947532,89625144,2016-07-29,1945966,Jessie Carol,"Kay was a lovely host and very welcoming & informative. My sister & i really enjoyed chatting with Kay & her partner and especially cuddles with little Minty the baby lamb :-) The property with the gardens & many sculptures is very picturesque, even in winter & the short walk to the creek & deck overlooking the running creek was a surprise. The property was easy to locate & well situated to explore the Barossa by car. We would definitely stay again if back in the area!"
10947532,92260232,2016-08-08,76690448,Sophie,"We can not recommend the Stables enough! Kay was lovely,  and gave us a warm welcome when we arrived.  She was enthusiastic and very helpful in suggesting things to see and do in the area.  The accommodation was absolutely gorgeous,  like your own slice of Barossa heaven.  It was private and cosy for our winter stay and for summer stays there is a big swimming pool. Rowland Flat is very well situated right by some amazing wineries and close to Tanunda town.  The bike path also goes right past their property! We loved our stay and will definitely be returning. "
10947532,96192238,2016-08-22,6709478,Ellie,"Kay's B&B was perfect for our getaway to the Barossa. You feel like you're out in the country but only a 5 minute drive from the main strip in Tanunda. The studio is very homely, the bed is comfortable and Kay kindly supplied us with the basics - milk, juice, bread, choccies and port. She is also a local and gives fantastic suggestions for places to visit and local knowledge. We loved our stay in the Barossa. "
10947532,98247707,2016-08-30,32321775,Thomas,"Kay was amazing. We may as well have been meeting a relative or family friend who could not have tried harder to make our stay a special one. The spot is incredibly iconic, to walk through her little farm with its metalwork sculptures and rustic outdoor setting looking over a river was an experience in itself. This was coupled with a very cute little private house and a bath supplied with lavender salts and a kitchen with freshly laid eggs! Everyone in the town knows Kay and she was able to point us in all the right directions. Kay, you will be receiving all of our visiting family members who come your way!"
10947532,98949161,2016-09-02,86979292,Coralie,"Staying at Rowland Flat was a pleasant experience for us. The compact and beautifully designed space is private and very comfortable. Kay is a gracious host who made sure we were well looked after. The property is full of beautiful gardens and bountiful chooks, whose lovely eggs were in a basket in the fridge when we arrived. The kitchen is new and nicely done. The old brass bed is not only gorgeous but ver very comfortable. All in all a very good Airbnb experience. Thanks Kay! from Coralie and Peter McKinn"
10947532,100152329,2016-09-07,31828608,Matt,Lovely place and surroundings
10947532,101212144,2016-09-12,26093291,Karen,"We loved staying at the stables. The exquisite garden was about to burst into spring colour with the backdrop of vineyards, along with a few sheep and chooks. Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking on the bike track through the vineyards which was easy to get to at the back of the property. It was also a very central but quiet location for visiting local cafes and wineries and generally imbibing the joys of the Barossa."
10947532,101318423,2016-09-12,23001142,Cara,"Kay and Madeline were exceptional hosts at their beautiful converted stables in the Barossa. The accommodation was just stunning, well set up with everything you need for your stay. The property has vines, gardens, a pool, a deck overlooking the river, sculptures, animals and more! A great location, close to everything, yet far enough away to feel rural. The highlight for me was the hospitality from the ladies... Thankyou for the conversation and the laughs! Will be back again next year!!"
10947532,102120932,2016-09-16,58965714,Peter,"Kay is a welcoming and engaging host. Stables is a quaint, rustic well-appointed cottage set in a serene garden with Kay's own Shiraz and Grenache vines within close proximity to the Barossa wineries. It would have been easy to stay extra days and get to know Kay better as she is vibrant and obliging host."
10947532,102963060,2016-09-19,1480130,Sarah,"Kay made us feel very welcome. She is an excellent host. The Stables is a beautiful, quiet place to stay. Every little detail has been thought of. Comfortable & super clean. Lovely touches like free range eggs, home made jam & port. We can't wait to plan our next trip to the Barossa to stay at Kay's place. "
10947532,104259874,2016-09-25,27832520,Emily,"Kay was fantastic!!! we loved every minute at the stables!!!! Kay supplied eggs, fresh bread, milk and juice for our stay along with some  yummy choccies and port! We loved waking up to the beautiful gardens in the morning! Kay helped us with choosing wineries to visit during our stay and was a pleasure to be around! The property is fantastic and close to everything! We will make sure we stay with Kay again on our next visit to the beautiful Barossa!"
10947532,105441169,2016-10-01,46533776,ChrisandWilf,Great place in fact perfect for us. Close to vineyards and everything you expect in this area. Caring hostess.
10947532,107254761,2016-10-09,9711288,Susan,"Kay was such an amazing host! I was visiting the region with a group of friends (who were staying at the Novotel), and she was really accommodating with the time of arrival (late afternoon, after some wines!). The place was very clean and tidy. It had everything I needed, including some delicious eggs from her chooks! The whole place is beautifully done."
10947532,108697012,2016-10-16,25331424,Judith,"The Stables are a charming and beautiful BNB. The hosts are very friendly and helpful and our stay was made extremely pleasant by their interaction and manner. The rooms are exactly as described and very homely and comfortable. Spring had certainly sprung in the surrounding gardens full of lavender, roses, rosemary and fruit trees. Rowland Flat is very close as is Tanunda, both charming towns full of stone cottages and interesting shops, restaurants and cafes. The Stables is conveniently located in the Barossa Valley and is close to many famous wineries. We drove from Adelaide through Lyndoch to Rowland Flat which I would recommend to others. This journey is through the Adelaide Hills and although slower than the motorway far more picturesque. "

It is an ideal location for exploring the Barossa and surrounds and Kay and Madeline made us feel very welcome! We will be recommending this property to friends and family when traveling in the Barossa area! Thanks for our lovely stay!

They take great pride in their gardens and the hard work has certainly paid off - wow! The property is even better than described and cleanliness absolutely exceptional. Breakfast was supplied, with eggs coming from their very own free-range chickens. The location couldn't have been more perfect for exploring the Barossa and we will certainly be coming back to stay; we have never felt more at home at someone else's place and never before welcomed with such love! Thank you Kay and Madeline!<br/>"

I would definitely stay with Kay again when next in the Barossa"

Also very close to Lyndoch, which is a small town with restaurants and cafes. The property itself was beautiful, it was like a quaint English cottage. The house has everything you could need, with eggs and milk provided in the fridge and your own private outdoor seating area. It was truly idyllic. And Kay was a fantastic host! She was very welcoming and accomodating. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"

Kay showed us to our accommodation and settled us in and made us feel at home right away. There aren't enough superlatives to describe how gorgeous the accommodation and property were. The cottage was stocked with everything we could have asked for, and the free range eggs from Kay's chickens were about the best we've ever had. We cannot recommend this property enough and we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else the next time we visit the Barossa!"
10947532,116085274,2016-11-27,12524624,Renee,"We had the best time staying at The Stables, from the first smiley greeting from Kay to the last hug when we left.

Although I planned to spend time in the gorgeous claw-foot bath, I found myself too busy enjoying the pool which was a welcome relief from the summer heat. The most gorgeous little hand-made stools offer a lovely view of a beautifully tended and well-thought out garden. Kay left eggs from her hens in the fridge for us so we were fully equipped for a little breakfast. She was gracious and old wordly enough to even leave out some complimentary port! We were thoroughly comfortable there and Kay was a bit of a delight to meet and chat with. The grape vines are literally just over the fence offering a beautiful outlook and there is also a little stream nearby to soak up the sunset at a portable set of table and chairs. I can't rave about it enough. Just go. Stay a while. Barossa a lot. "

10947532,142600889,2017-04-08,90214812,Nigel,"I stayed with Kay in the days leading up to my wedding and my wedding night. Kay and her partner were fantastic, caring and helpful - even helping to fix my father's boutonniere, which had the rose head fall off while we were getting ready on my wedding day.<br/><br/>It was the little touches too, like a congratulatory note on the chalkboard, a bottle of bubbles and an awesome bath bomb for our wedding night."

From the scented garden, free ranging chickens to the warm hilarious hostesses with the mostess. We had such a chilled food frenzied long weekend in the Barossa and couldn't think of a more gorgeous place to stay. The Stables are straight out of a country style editorial. Perfectly refurbished with all the right touches. Highlights were eating fresh eggs for brekky, taking a soak in the  claw foot bath, and binging on books on the verandah.

The bed was fantastic, the bathroom deluxe and the serenity was second to none. There were fresh eggs and coffee in the morning, topped off by a peaceful wine on the deck, at night. We loved watching the Kelpies and Polly the horse roam free, amongst Kay and Madeleine's home grown vines. <br/><br/>The location was perfectly placed between Lyndoch and Tanunda, allowing for a short drive to many wineries - there are even a few that are in walking distance!<br/>We felt extremely safe and secure whilst staying here and would absolutely visit again. <br/><br/>Thanks to Kay and Madeleine for a relaxing and refreshing long weekend!

Gorgeous quaint cottage, picture windows filled with sunlight, beautifully furnished with personality and stunning surrounds. Kay really has nailed the set up, thinking about all the little needs and delights that guests hope to find and provided a lovely brekkie with self-contained kitchenette to cook it up in! Highly recommend walking past the vineyard, past the horse and chooks, up to their deck which overlooks the river. If you are a light sleeper you may hear the odd vehicle on the nearby road during the night, although nothing to put us off coming back. Thanks very much for having us Kay and your hospitality. <br/>"

Kay and Madeleine were such wonderful hosts - warm, welcoming, and so hospitable. They were very willing to offer suggestions and recommendations for out-of-towners. The Stables is in a great location - at the start of a nice stretch to Tanunda with more than a handful of wineries on the way. We definitely recommend borrowing the bikes - the bike path is beautiful (slightly challenging for a wine lover but definitely worth it for the view - and the wineries along the way!). The Stables was the epitome of country charm - it was lovely to wake up with a view into the private gardens, enjoy a long hot soak in the claw foot bath, and partake in a leisurely breakfast of local produce including home-made preserves and fresh eggs! We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this AirBnB and hope to visit again soon. "

Chooks, a horse and beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) truly a fairytale. The bed is super comfy and the home is equipped with everything you'll need, not to mention a deep claw foot tub with homemade bath salts and candles. The place backs up onto a sprawling vineyard and a short walk takes you to a verandah overhanging a beautiful river below. It's a little paradise.

Between the fruit trees, vines, dogs, horses and chickens - what a fun experience. And the stable cottage was beautiful with small touches everywhere - including apple juice, chocolates and a tasty dessert liqueur. I rented a bike and hopped on the convenient bike trail (literally along their property) and easily toured the local wineries and road into town for some food.  After a long day of riding, I came home and took a bath in their amazing clawfoot bathtub with some provided bath salts. What a great place. Highly, highly recommend!"

The cottage is surrounded by a beautiful garden, and beyond that vineyards and forest.  Whether sitting out under the verandah at the back of the cottage, or sitting at the kitchen bench top looking out the window, the views and general ambience are superb.  The cottage itself was well laid out, and very clean, and Kay's attention to detail and thoughtful touches - eggs from her own chickens and local milk in the fridge, ground coffee and quality muesli in the cupboard, chocolates and port - made for a thoroughly enjoyable stay from start to finish.  We cooked dinner each night on the BBQ at the back of the cottage, and also particularly enjoyed walking along the cycle/walking path that runs along the back of Kay's property, alongside a creek with wild olive trees and then on through the vineyards to Jacob's Creek and St Hugo's.  Highly recommended."

The port, fresh eggs, bread and juices were lovely. Kay and Maddy were very welcoming and always keen to give us local advice.

We did a great early morning walk (30-40 mins) through her paddock onto a bike / hiking trail that heads to Jacob's Creek winery that gave us some beautiful vistas over the vines. We had to cut our stay short due to family circumstances and Kay was very understanding. She gave us a list of villages to stop in on our way back to Adelaide, travelling through the Adelaide Hills which we thoroughly enjoyed."

Kay provides a gorgeous supply of breakfast ingredients, all local or home made. the tranquillity of their home is food for the soul. Loved the deck area overlooking the creek too. The property is very close to enough wineries to fill at least a weekend, Jacob's Creek, Rockfords and Lou Miranda were our favourites. We cycled to the wineries as the property is very close to the bike track, which was quite challenging but worth it. One of the best airbnb properties we have stayed in and we have stayed in many, all over the world."

Great to have a private pool to yourself and the deck is a picturesque spot for evening drinks. The bed is firm if this is your thing and the cottage is very nicely styled and clean. We loved the friendly dogs and chickens! The hosts were great at giving local tips of where to go and what to see throughout our stay."

Set amongst the vineyards and tucked away in a quiet spot just outside of Tanunda, but within a stone's throw of Australia's best wineries.  Chooks on site providing fresh eggs each morning.  A beautiful deck over the creek frontage.  Immaculate gardens.  Swimming pool.  A gorgeous cottage.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Kay and Mads were the best hosts we have encountered, providing wonderful tips about local restaurants and sites.   We felt like we were staying with old friends.   This property is the gateway to everything the Barossa has to offer.   Book!  It will far exceed your expectations"

Perfectly positioned just out of Tanunda, it’s a cute little place with chickens, dogs, a swimming pool (which was great when 40C), a veggie garden and deck overlooking the river.

The accommodation was spotlessly clean and well appointed with amenities. The personal touches (like homemade jam and fresh eggs from the henhouse in the fridge) were an unexpected touch.

Kay was a super friendly host and her dogs and chickens were adorable."

10947532,421250983822342955,2021-08-04,274872501,Tracy,"From the moment we met our host Kay at the gate to the moment she waved us goodbye we knew we would not forget our time at The Stables. The cottage and its surrounds were peaceful, calming and beautiful. A surprise behind every gate and around every corner. From the special treats left in the fridge to the tasty local port this place will make you glad you didn’t go anywhere else. Kay and Madeline are lovely and full of local knowledge to guide you through their little part of heaven in the Barossa Valley."

They are passionate about their private piece of paradise and a wealth of knowledge for the local area. I recommend leaving some spare time to ponder their sensational garden, homegrown produce and enjoy a tipple on their deck, perched over the Para River. Their puppers are super friendly welcoming committee."

Great welcoming hosts who have done an amazing job with this property. The dogs and chickens give the place a warm homely vibe.

The cottage was set up very well with a well equipped kitchen. There were also some great personal touches throughout. And the property is great. The deck down the back, the gardens and plenty of space to explore and walk around. Plus Daisy and Tib were always there to welcome us back. Highly recommend and hope to be back again some day"

The place itself was lovely to stay in, and was not too far from Tanunda, and other areas of the Barossa we visited. Kay and her partner were extremely welcoming, and we absolutely look forward to a future stay at the Stables!"
10947532,510361027312477640,2021-12-04,176690735,Dean,Cannot recommend The Stables more highly. A perfect place to set up and explore everything that the Barossa Valley has to offer. The private deck over the creek was a perfect spot for sundowners and a cheese board. The bike and walking trail through Jacobs Creek and St Hallets was gorgeous.
10947532,534980316029227644,2022-01-07,245651140,Emily,"If you’re thinking about booking it, just book it! This is by far my favourite Air BnB. Not only is ita perfect location to explore the Barossa, but Kay and Madeline are the most beautiful hosts. The cottage is surrounded by the most stunning gardens (Kay has a brilliant green thumb) to enjoy relaxing, reading, a swim in the pool, or a wine on the deck. We’ll definitely be coming back hopefully soon."
10947532,545910706683309320,2022-01-23,6770107,Marlyn,Simply stunning is the only way to describe The Stables accommodation and it’s surrounds . We enjoyed 9 nights here and didn’t want to leave . This beautiful accommodation is enhanced by two brilliant hosts who are very accommodating. The Stables is a great place to enjoy all the Barossa has to offer .

10971607,84393090,2016-07-07,73686754,Anna,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the Angaston Masonic Lodge !<br/>Firstly we were welcomed by a cosy fire, a surprise platter and a bottle of wine . Then a spacious apartment that was both very comfortable and clean. We were really appreciative of off street parking being on the main strip of Angaston.<br/>The Masonic Lodge was a perfect central location for the Barossa wineries and HOSPITABLE eateries as well.<br/>We found Robyn to be a thoughtful host that is clearly passionate about creating an appealing , homely and relaxing ""bnb"". We look forward to returning to Angaston Masonic Lodge again !<br/>Anna and Friends."

10971607,115130553,2016-11-21,91763584,Natalie,"I am so excited to write this review. We had the most wonderful experience staying in Angaston at The Masonic Lodge - and it was all because of our host Robyn. <br/>This was my first holiday travelling with Bub, 8 months old, and we were flying so I was pretty nervous.<br/>When I told Robyn we were travelling with a baby, she went well above what I ever expected.<br/>Robyn organised a high chair, change mat, helped me organise a portacot, made me feel confident there was a supermarket / chemist  across the road that had everything I needed. Which was perfect we were flying.<br/>We arrived to a smiling face and a welcome pack of nibbles, cheese and wine - aircon was on and the lodge just felt like a home.<br/>We stayed for 5 nights and I just didn't want to leave! The bed was so unbelievably comfy! <br/>It just kept shocking me of all the things Robyn thought of, from supplying absolutely everything we needed (shampoo/conditioner, body wash and I mean top quality products), to a little medical kit of panadol and bandaids!<br/>As we were new to the area, I texted Robyn throughout our stay and she assisted with our every request.<br/>The lodge had such a glorious heritage feeling and the styling just made me feel like I had stepped back in time, from the original piano (I think over 100 years old!) to the high ceiling (I mean very very high!)<br/>I informed Robyn we wanted to have a BBQ so she set up an outdoor area with an umbrella with all utensils, oils etc.<br/>I would highly recommend in staying here, we will definitely be back :)<br/>Thank you Robyn for your incredible hospitality. Angaston is an incredible little town and The Masonic Lodge is right where you need to be."
10971607,207297252,2017-10-29,130525649,Peter,"The check in procedure, facilities and service was super!!<br/>Loved the local wine and cheese board waiting for us along with food for a great cooked breakfast the next morning"
10971607,248638377,2018-04-01,20287280,Neil,"Brilliant accomm, right in the middle of Angaston in the midst of the wineries, great, big, comfy space to relax, celebrate and have a great time! Thanks Robyn for all the extra little touches to make our time even more special, from the cheese board to the Easter eggs, it made our time even more enjoyable."
11380095,65417065,2016-03-13,3884758,Meredythe,"the house was great.   new, modern and had pretty much everything you needed.     the house was clean,  lots of space if you had a big group.   2 sitting areas, outdoor dining table, modern appliances.  it had clean modern bathrooms.    it was close to the main street of town and about 5 minutes to some of the best wineries.    "
11380095,79618672,2016-06-13,13287226,Vahram,"The house, as well as the hosts' service and responsiveness, exceeded all our expectations. The house is quite large, easily fitting our group of 4 couples. And it was in immaculate condition. Only minutes drive from the best wineries in the region, this place makes a perfect base for a short holiday.<br/>The hosts' responsiveness was also perfect, with communications prior and during our stay. In fact, during our stay the responses to our emails were almost immediate.<br/>A 5 star experience all around."
11380095,101347803,2016-09-12,61424740,Nick,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Little House in Barossa. John and Bianca were very responsive throughout the booking process as well as being available for questions on arrival via text and phone.   We certainly appreciated the welcoming bottle of wine they left for us!<br/><br/>The house itself is contemporary in style with all the convenience of new modern appliances. There is a washer and dryer in the huge laundry room for longer stays.  More than enough room to accommodate our large family event with 3 queen bedrooms and one room with a bunk bed and trundle. Individualized heating for different zones of the house was nice as well. Very comfortable, clean and spacious. <br/><br/>The location is perfect for getting to wineries and activities inThe Barossa. We are extremely happy we found such a wonderful house. <br/><br/>Our only suggestions would be the following:  in communications just prior to arrival it would be nice to have been given the house number. That or put a sign on the house saying 'Little House in the Barossa'. <br/><br/>Secondly. For the amount if money we spent per night, we feel that there should be wifi included in the price particularly in todays connected world. <br/><br/>Overall we rate this 5 stars and really loved our stay. Thank you John and Bianca "
11380095,106051261,2016-10-03,58400395,Emma,A fantastic little home in the heart of the Barossa. We had a group of 9 girls and there was plenty of room without feeling like we were constantly on top of one another. Everything was very clean and tidy and comfortable for our long weekend stay. John and Bianca were very friendly and accommodating prior to arrival and I would definitely recommend this place to others.
11380095,111580416,2016-10-31,45260233,Simon,Bianca was very helpful. Had a great stay!

The bbq was really dirty and we could not use it. <br/>* Supply garbage bags and dish washing liquid as the ppl who would hire this house would more than likely use the kitchen. <br/><br/>Overall a great, comfortable home in the heart of the Barossa that is well suited to a family."
11380095,146845519,2017-04-23,61058490,Lisa,Had a great stay. Great communication with owners with great information about the area. Clean and comfortable. Would recommend others to stay during their time trying out the beautiful winery's in the Barrossa area.

We loved our locally baked vegemite scrolls and our children loved the games room. We were not home much due to exploring the region but did miss free wifi. A dishwasher, washing machine, Weber Bbq lessened the cooking and cleaning load and with a well equipped kitchen cooking your meals at home saved us a few dollars (although we spent it all on wine). Gracious hosts with great communication and ease of check in and out made our week enjoyable...."

11380095,320498950,2018-09-09,99845447,Norma,This is a great place to stay if you are touring the Barossa and need somewhere comfortable to lay your head and have breakfast. It is in a new housing estate so perhaps lacks some of the atmosphere of the area but  makes up for that in comfort and cleanliness

11428035,125811720,2017-01-07,26149964,Rebecca,Gorgeous house. Great for a lazy holiday. Walking distance from winery Chateau Tanunda.
11428035,127396568,2017-01-17,47068234,Rebecca,"great house, so much character and super central location"
11428035,128684238,2017-01-26,14875014,Emma,"The tin house at tanunda is perfect for any kind of trio. We came for business but did not feel like we were working. Beautiful massive old house with all the mod cons. Amazing yard full of fruit trees, central to everything.. Could not have asked for any more. Thanks for opening your house to us."
11428035,128973722,2017-01-28,9710139,Camille,Lovely home with every thing you need.
11428035,134008236,2017-02-25,117242583,Jodi,"Brilliant getaway with friends, Inside is super cute and  cosy, however we spent most of our time enjoying the quiet under the vines at the back door, followed by a delightful snooze on the green lawn in the sun the next day. Highly recommend and we will return."
11428035,135193004,2017-03-03,36849227,Nat,"Great, centrally located house. Really lovely feel. "
11428035,142581591,2017-04-08,5675025,Lisa,The house is in a great location. It's very quiet but only a short walk to the centre of town. It has a lot of lovely period features and a wonderful eating area out the back of the house under grape vines. The only problem was that the back bedroom bed is only a twin and it is uncomfortable. 
11428035,169015350,2017-07-11,20840344,Corinna,"We had a lovely stay in this beautiful house. So close to the main street, but quiet and peaceful. The kitchen was well equiped and there was plenty of wood for the open fire (the central heating was great too, but it Winter getaway and all). Thanks."
11428035,171178260,2017-07-17,98856934,Nikita,"This house is gorgeous and roomy. There is a great large working fireplace in the lounge room which we took great advantage of and there is a pretty cool cellar underground in the kitchen which ties in so perfectly with the fact that you have tons of fantastic wineries at your doorstep. Unfortunately the beds weren't partically comfortable or long enough (I'm 5'10). Overall, great value for money, good spot for a family or a friend's weekend away!"
11428035,175806878,2017-07-29,110605911,Jason,Lovely place to stay with the family.  Very hand location as well.
11428035,233262181,2018-02-08,45338746,Tyson,"A wonderful abode in the Barossa, perfectly located in a quiet street yet still just a quick stroll to all of the best locations in Tanunda. A delightful place to stay, uniting historic charm with renovated polish. We look forward to returning again soon!"
11428035,261083384,2018-05-06,2097797,Scott,"The location was great, the house was fantastic and we are looking forward to the next visit when we can hopefully stay in Kym's Tin House again"
11428035,276481977,2018-06-14,136711507,Nicole,"Beautiful house in a great location. Perfect for a young family like ours - close park, comfortable beds and a backyard to explore. Thanks for having us!"
11428035,332268962,2018-10-05,33343516,Leanne,"The Tin House is in a great location with plenty of space for up to six people. Cosy lounge room with open fire, and fabulous gardens front and rear.  Would be great to see all the roses in bloom!"
11428035,336106251,2018-10-14,79637119,John,"A beautiful place, spotlessly clean, great gardens and centrally located. We couldn't ask for more."
11428035,344562634,2018-11-04,95639481,Robert,Lovely house - comfortable - clean - close to town - perfect....
11428035,350287992,2018-11-18,126834318,Kath,"Great location, only a short walk from the main street of Tunanda. Perfect for a weekend get away."
11428035,420183856,2019-03-05,34705824,Lukshmi,Convenient to all Tanunda and ideal for 2 - 3 couples to stay

Great size and facilities for 3 couples wanting an authentic Barossa experience. Cosy and warm with a wood fire and aircon. Responsive communication and customer service."
11428035,574170336,2019-12-08,5243031,Michael,"It would be hard to find a better located property in Tanunda. The Tin House was spacious, with a nice backyard to enjoy a morning coffee or a glass of vine in the afternoon. I wouldn't hesitate to stay in the property again on our next visit. Thanks Kym! Michael"
11428035,586529691,2020-01-02,52049675,Calin,"This is a great place, right in the heart of Tanunda! You are within a short walking distance of several great coffee shops and restaurants, that would satisfy even the most demanding tastes. At the same time, you are less than 10 min driving from most Barossa wineries, and some of them are actually within a short walking or biking distance. I couldn't have asked for a better place as a base camp for all our Barossa valley explorations!"
11428035,711535404,2020-11-27,53652453,Andrew,Great location and very close to the centre of town...
11428035,749670058,2021-04-18,22475355,Scott,Great central location. Recommended.
11428035,752253854,2021-04-26,95222646,Natalie,"Great location, Squeaky clean, Amazing facilities, Cosy and Warm, Beautiful house, Spacious and comfortable"
11428035,532084510257681591,2022-01-03,1270502,Rayna,"The house was clean, spacious and well-located. It looks nicer than in the pictures. The fireplace was pre-setup with firewood and kindling already built to use, which was great.<br/> <br/>However - the house is advertised as having a spa, however when we went to shower there was no hot water. The management company rang us and gave us instructions to change the gas bottles, which we followed (this was outside in the cold late at night), but to no avail. They must have all been empty. Steve, who we spoke to on phone, was incredulous that they would all be empty, but he drove in to check/change them. He was working on them at midnight, and they must have turned out to be empty or some other issue, as he came back at 1am to continue/finish. This meant we slept very poorly despite the comfortable bedding (he tried to be quiet, but our room was on the same wall as the gas bottles...). <br/>We had hot water the next morning, thanks to Steve, but didn't have time to use the spa as advertised. Also, when I finally got to have my shower, the nozzle adjustment module was broken so it sat at the bottom of the bar and I couldn't fit under it. I could only fit under it to wash by hair by holding it up with one hand. <br/><br/>I reached out to the management company before submitting my review, but they didn't respond to my email (I sent it 11 days ago at time of writing). Overall we didn't get the value and features of the house we paid for, and could have found more affordable accomodation. <br/>A related-tip: these days there are many airbnbs run by accomodation managers, regardless of the listed owners. Many of them are also listed on (Website hidden by Airbnb) for much cheaper. I found some houses run by Getaways in Tanunda for $200 cheaper on (Website hidden by Airbnb) than airbnb (as in the same house is on both sites). Too late for me as I'd booked already. For the quality, the lower prices are probably fairer, not sure why airbnb has gotten so expensive."
11857399,97498598,2016-08-27,6261997,Steve,"Wow!  Amazing building, brilliant location, tip top hosts, and every conceivable extra.  Too many special touches to list.  "
11857399,105748216,2016-10-02,3820999,Alex,"Robyn was very welcoming, and provided delicious snacks, drinks and food for breakfast, which made our stay wonderful. The bedrooms were cosy and warm, and the main room was huge, with pool table, music and fire (but it was a bit smoky from opening the fire door). The location is easy to find and walking distance to many places in Angaston, and easy to access the rest of the Barossa with car or taxi."
11857399,111029579,2016-10-29,29668692,Andy,Robyn was great to communicate with in the lead up to staying at the Angaston Masonic Lodge. This is a unique building and a comfortable place to stay in the heart of the Barossa.
11857399,112362263,2016-11-05,18946061,Tarnia,"The Masonic Lodge at Angaston was by far my best Air BnB experience yet. With a location as beautiful as this, you would expect a high quality stay, but Robyn truly went above and beyond to make our weekend spectacular. She made recommendations of what to do and where to go, and all the restaurants are within easy walking distance. <br/>So many little touches made such a big difference to our stay, from the picnic that she organised for us to take on our bike ride around the Barossa, to  stacking the fireplace, providing candles and a bath bomb for the spa, and supplying a beautiful fresh breakfast. You could not find better than this! 10/10"
11857399,117101110,2016-12-04,29670708,Neil,"We booked the Masonic Lodge for a road cycling holiday base in the Barossa and it turned out to be perfect for our needs.  Robyn's communication was truly excellent and responsive.  The lodge was spacious, clean and had a real uniqueness to it.  We were welcomed by a well stocked fridge and a bottle of very good local Shiraz.  The local town of Angaston is quiet, but has good selection of restaurants and shops nearby.  The coffee from Blonds next door was excellent too.  We honestly could not have asked for much more out of this lovely place."
11857399,123812128,2016-12-30,29961153,Alex,This place is amazing! Great little spot in the Barossa. Right in the center of Angaston and easy driving distance to all the great wineries. Robyn was a lovely host. If your looking for a historic stay in the Barossa - this is it! 
11857399,136650240,2017-03-11,116899997,Duy,"Robyn went the extra mile (literally, she drove many extra country miles) to ensure my friends and I made the most of our short stay in the Barossa. From the initial engagement, to itinerary suggestions, locally-sourced food and beverage provisions, and personalised transport, we could not fault the spot-on service or the spacious setup. Would definitely recommend and return for a unique stay."
11857399,144942316,2017-04-16,16460983,Melinda,"Robyn is a wonderful host and the lodge is a great space to stay in. Beautifully decorated and very large we felt very welcome and comfortable. Especially appreciated was the thoughtful yummy supplies that were left for us, after travelling for a while it was so nice to not have to go out for a meal.  Thank you :) "
11857399,146405071,2017-04-22,119545157,Emily,Fantastic location & so much charm!
11857399,159391646,2017-06-11,125295909,Margot,"This B and B is the best of many we have stayed in prior. The building was fascinating history, immaculately presented  and a pleasure to return home to after rambling through the beautiful countryside, classics Barossa towns and amazing wineries. Breakfast  and cheese provisions were very generous however with so many great eateries within a short walk we indulged in the local eateries often. Heating was great and furnished with stylish comfort in every room. . Robyn was very helpful in our planning and offered to drive and collect us to our restaurant for dinner just out of town,  I highly recommend this accomodation in beautiful Angaston. . "
11857399,170591856,2017-07-16,47433622,Chelsea,"What an airbnb to stay at! Everything you need! Robyn was very easy to deal with! She showed us around the lodge. Included was fruit, breakfast and different chesses (thanks Robyn!) Everything you need was here! There was a wood heater that was very toasty! The bedrooms had heating and electric blankets. A pool table. And even make up wipes and hair spray! Very central to everythinf yoy need as well. Would recommend this airbnb to anyone and would stay here again! "
11857399,175847157,2017-07-30,47291939,Kelly,Robyn was an excellent host and the lodge was perfect for our weekend in the barossa. Being mid-winter and with huge spaces to heat we were very pleasantly surprised at how effective the combustion heater was. The beds were comfy and breakfast provisions were phenomenal! 
11857399,181517833,2017-08-13,37025046,Joe,"Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Robyn was incredibly helpful, quick to respond to questions, and gave us amazing suggestions for things to see/do/taste in the region.<br/><br/>The building and amenities were absolutely stunning. The provided wine, cheese, and breakfast ingredients were wonderful. The wood fire was roaring before our arrival and the rooms were more than comfortable.<br/><br/>We lounged, played pool, had a game of chess, ate, drank, and relaxed, all in the utmost comfort. The region is stunning but the Angaston Masonic Lodge is even better. Our only regret that we didn't stay longer. Could not recommend this highly enough."
11857399,182124558,2017-08-14,109368227,Michelle,"Gorgeous weekend, accommodation was perfect and the extra special touches of detail by Robyn were first class. Thank you Robyn we will certainly be back."

The food was fresh, amazing and plentiful. Thanks Robyn for all your - everything that you could think of was there and the food stocks thoughtfulness I would not hesitate to recommend the Masonic Lodge and look forward to returning again soon."
11857399,194403136,2017-09-17,9306871,Andrew,What a wonderful place to stay in a beautiful part of the world<br/>Highly recommend the walk to Thorn-clark winery <br/>Robyn is a wonderful host and we highly recommend her fantastic Masonic Lodge with welcoming fireplace
11857399,196691322,2017-09-24,41576718,Zita,"Robyn's place at Angaston is amazing! My husband and I traveled with another couple, and we all had a very comfortable stay in this beautiful converted hall. The luxurious, warm bedrooms are at the front of the property, near the main street, but there was no real traffic noise. The back lounge room is truely enormous, and we loved sitting around the fireplace chatting and laughing after playing some very bad pool games on the pool table. Although we didn't get to meet Robyn, her communication was great; she had many suggestions for things to do in the Barossa region. We really appreciated her ideas and also the delicious breakfast supplies provided. This property is walking distance to cafes, shops and other places to eat. Thanks Robyn!"
11857399,200041430,2017-10-04,40366315,Jane,"We stayed for 10 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Robyn is a great host, very responsive and really wants to make sure you have a good stay.<br/><br/>The place is huge.  Really comfortable.  The water pressure was great for showers.  Robyn and Andrew provide plenty of firewood every day.  When Robyn mentions about providing breakfast provisions... she provides a lot of provisions.  Couldn't ask for more.  She tries to cover all bases - cereal, fruit, yoghurt, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, herbs, halumi, cheese, bread, crumpets... a lot.  Very generous.<br/><br/>there's other nice touches, such as face wipes, hair spray, shaving foam, anything that Robyn can think to provide she does. <br/><br/>The place is old, it creaks in odd places but it is a historical building.  The beds were very comfortable.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay again."

11857399,220149832,2017-12-21,48652727,Sue,The house exceeded our expectations.  It was a lovely space and we felt at home immediately.  We enjoyed playing pool again after many years of not playing. There were lots of welcome provisions which was great after a long journey.  Location was perfect and Robyn was a great host who was very welcoming and gave us great suggestions on things to do.
11857399,230307855,2018-01-28,1400990,Anet,"Robyn and her partner have been the best hosts I have been with so far and I have been to a lot of Airbnb places! Everything was special, the place, the location and most of all the hosts. It was a 360° all around amazing experience! The building itself and all the beautiful little touches and interior designs, close to absolute perfection. <br/>They showed us some amazing wineries and even sent the scarf back that I had forgotten.<br/>We absolutely loved it. If you plan to stay in a central place in the Barossa, this is it :)"

11857399,266955545,2018-05-20,151161596,Elizabeth,This is a unique property in a fabulous location. The attention to detail was amazing.  Plentiful local produce for breakfast as well as pre dinner cheeses and after dinner chocolates and fresh fruit. Robyn thought of everything. The abundant fresh flowers were a nice touch and it was great to arrive to the fire already warming the enormous living area. We just wish we had booked for a couple of extra nights.
11857399,269117239,2018-05-27,82048906,Kathryn,"The unique property in Anguston was a beautiful place to spend a weekend away in the Barossa.

11857399,294278795,2018-07-22,34486144,Emma,Staying at Robyn’s house which is tucked into a sleepy town in the Barossa was lovely. She was incredibly helpful with local knowledge and provided a great list of things to do. The house is an interesting historical hall converted into a lovely home. Robyn provided all the comforts we needed for a night and more! 
11857399,301252058,2018-08-04,9637935,Drew,great location with lots of special touches from local wine and cheeses to an awesome breakfast selection. the log fireplace was already on and made the place a wonderful place to relax at the end of a long day.

11857399,343515393,2018-10-31,10953070,Jen,"This fabulous space, once Angaston's masonic hall built in 1912, was a great respite for us - 2 older couples on a road trip through South Australia!. None of us were on a romantic getaway so the spa and the sheep skin rug  in front of the fire didn't entice us. But the quality linen on the brass beads did beckon us all to a good nights rest after a good hot shower and white fluffy bath towels.. We opted to stay at home and cook that night so shopped in Angaston for local product which was almost unnecessary because the Welcome package was the best I've ever encountered anywhere ever. Our hostess Robyn left us wanting for absolutely nothing. Her attention to detail was beyond the pail. Our  airbnb experience here was the best.."
11857399,344571535,2018-11-04,23437354,Katherine,"This accommodation far exceeded my expectations. The Masonic Lodge was very clean, had fastastic facilities and was in a very convinient location."

Robyn goes out of her way to make your stay enjoyable. A generous amount of locally produced food and wine was left for us to enjoy.<br/><br/>Would recommend to anyone wanting to set up a base for touring the Barossa.
11857399,352165493,2018-11-24,224267326,Joanne,"Robyn is a fantastic host. The breakfast ingredients were of the highest standard, local Barossa bacon, eggs, tomatoes, avocado, asparagus and spinach. Cheeses, salami, biscuits, nuts, wine none of which I was expecting. Robyn also took us for our lunch reservation and picked us up. She was very helpful. We loved the place, the pool table and the fire. Great location in a beautiful town. Would definitely recommend."
11857399,354450413,2018-12-01,41811556,Mandi,"Fabulous place to stay in the Barossa, easy reach of local attractions. Robyn & Andrew were awesome hosts, made our stay very enjoyable & easy. Would highly recommend."

11857399,418774674,2019-03-03,150769137,David,Great communication from Robyn from booking to check-in. Robyn provided us with tips on the local restaurants and offered to prepare to accommodate for our toddler with portacot and high chair. The accommodation itself was amazing and beyond our expectations. We thoroughly enjoyed our night and the amenities provided. The local produce for breakfast was delicious. Would highly recommend. We ourselves intend to rerun for the winter experience.
11857399,422377087,2019-03-11,251626,Adam,"Robyn's place is stunning, absolutely loved our stay!"
11857399,433626522,2019-04-07,26893297,Heather,"Robyn’s place is outstanding. Amazing place with super high ceilings. 2 rooms with extra comfortable beds. There is plenty of space and then some and is set up well for whatever you desire- sitting on the couch, listening to music or even getting on the mic for a song. <br/><br/>We didn’t give ourselves enough time to enjoy the breakfast provisions but were impressed at all the food that had been left for us. <br/><br/>Great location right on the Main Street on Angaston. We will definitively come back again."
11857399,440494033,2019-04-21,166506364,Maxine,"Robyn was our perfect host. The ‘lodge’ is centrally located in the town of Angaston. We were charmed by its history and character, so many little touches were included. We loved a game of pool with a glass of Barossa red at the end of each day. The kitchen is small but we coped. We had a lovely stay."
11857399,441482575,2019-04-22,4648960,Sarojini,Beautiful heritage place very centrally located. The house was warm and clean and to add on there was spa which we thoroughly enjoyed. Robyn had also arranged tour to the wineries and had packed us nice lunch. Very friendly host recommend to all

Andrew even popped in to help us with the fireplace! <br/><br/>A magestic building with all the mod cons set in a town steeped in history I thoroughly recommend this experience! For us it was the perfect stay with great hosts! Thank you Andrew and Robyn!
11857399,500923827,2019-08-03,187203746,Wiktor,"What an amazing weekend we had at Robyn’s place! From the crackling fire that was ready for us when we arrived to the bottle of wine on the table welcoming us to the beautiful Barossa region, everything was just perfect. There’s something really special about coming home to such a beautifully preserved historic building and sitting in front of the fire.  There was great local produce stocked in the fridge for breakfast and wine-touring snacks which we certainly tucked in to! But, if you’re after a more active weekend than we had, Robyn was full of suggestions. Cannot recommend this place enough!  <br/>Many thanks again - love Caitlin, Wiktor and Wolfgang!!"
11857399,554759169,2019-10-27,58708136,Michael,"Throughly recommend staying here should you travel to the Barossa.

It’s a little dated but that adds to fun of staying here and fits in well with the wine tasting experience. The activities such as the pool table got good use and Robyn leaves you food for breakfast and snacks which is nice.

Highly recommended. - Glen & Karen
11857399,388670628868457229,2021-06-20,219404193,Anna,"Such a wonderful and unique way to experience the area! The hall was massive and well situated on the Main Street close to cafes, grocery store etc. The host went over and above leaving food and wine, plus the place was well stocked with blankets, toiletries, kitchen utensils etc. Pretty much anything you need or  might have otherwise forgotten was there! The fireplace was also a highlight for us. Thankful for a wonderful stay and would 100% recommend to others!"

Fantastic location in the heart of Angaston - it has a lot of history and something a touch unique. It had everything you could want including a comfy bed, great breakfast provisions and a fire to keep you warm whilst playing cards as you enjoyed some of the local wines bought during the day. <br/><br/>Would absolutely stay here again. Thanks to Robyn for a fantastic weekend, we loved it!"
11857399,398117892201977806,2021-07-03,70416327,Emily,"This was our second stay as we’d done a cheese making course at the cultured cheese school in tanunda. We enjoyed it as much as the first, it was a cold weekend but the wood fire and heaters in the bedroom helped with the chill & the electric blankets. <br/>Such good value for money with breakfast provisions, cheese and wine on arrival which was very welcomed. Amazing location too, short stroll to the local pubs and a food land across the road. Great host who is very accomodating, will stay again!"

11915715,84394248,2016-07-07,45124734,Tamara,"The property was absolutely gorgeous ( photo's do not do it justice) green and lush paddocks with plenty of space to walk around or set the kids loose. The home was really warm and inviting, Richard was kind enough to have the fire burning before we arrived. The beds were comfortable with electric blankets. The whole house is tastefully decorated and much bigger than we were expecting. I had a friend down from Sydney to give her the Barossa experience and this was the perfect place to stay after a day of wine tasting. I would highly recommend this Airbnb property, I will be back with the rest of the family!!!"
11915715,90561261,2016-08-01,6034036,Guadalupe,"Amazing adorable idyllic cottage. The photos do not do it justice. We were there on a very cold wet winters day and the cottage was warm, cosy and spotlessly clean. It is the type of place you feel at home immediately. The gardens and isolated location were an absolute bonus- without feeling like you were completely alone. Love, love, love "
11915715,97535363,2016-08-27,88581056,Nicole,loved the cottage it was lovely the surrounding property was gorgeous and it was great to be able to stroll around down to the creek . would highly recommend staying at riverstone cottage you wont be disappointed.

11915715,139508919,2017-03-25,72827404,Matt,"The photos don't do this gem justice. If you don't mind staying slightly out of Tanunda, you'll love the setting and charm of this cottage. Relaxing and tasteful, and great AV and food/coffee. If you get time, walk down to the canyon to find kangaroos and birds. Lovely. "
11915715,169832883,2017-07-14,134600775,Yvonne,"The cottage is in a perfect setting.  The private garden was beautiful, as were the charming Toulouse Geese and the lambs  in the farm house grounds outside the cottage garden.    We needed a restful holiday and the  it was a tonic,   peaceful and very beautiful.   The house is generous, with a well equipped kitchen,  big dining room and we  enjoyed the gorgeous fire in the living room each night. The walks are lovely.  You can share a part of the history of the Barossa Valley and enjoy!"
11915715,211708942,2017-11-13,154417869,Kate,Beautiful farm location for staying in the Barossa. Only 20min to any winery. And a relaxing quite place to come back to after a days travel and tastings.

11915715,244593862,2018-03-19,29751953,Lee,"This is a beautiful cottage with lots of character.  Very spacious.  The kitchen is very well equipped.  It's in a lovely setting, very quiet and peaceful, occasionally you can hear the baaing of the sheep.  We enjoyed sitting out in the garden.  Richard responded immediately to our messages.  The gas tank was changed within 30 minutes when we ran out of hot water.  We never met Richard, but we enjoyed talking to his parents."
11915715,254720402,2018-04-18,35928721,Grant,"The cottage is perfect for a quiet, secluded escape. You feel like you are a million miles from anywhere, when you are only 10 minutes from town and 20 minutes from all the wineries in the Barossa. The cottage is cosy and well appointed with all the appliances you could imagine. Richard was a great host and the breakfast basket (which was delicious) was a nice touch. Can't recommend staying here enough."
11915715,335683210,2018-10-13,131122911,Nicky,"We had a fantastic stay at the cottage, the kids absolutely loved it. Would definitely recommend it if you’re heading to the Barossa!"
11915715,347139043,2018-11-11,150792705,Astrid,"The perfect location, tucked away on a working farm. It was easy to get into Lyndoch for coffee or shopping. The house is very cosy and you are tempted to stay home with a nice bottle to take in nature and the views. We in particular appreciated the outstanding breakfast produce that was offered - the best bread ever, amazing eggs, jam, milk and butter! A place to return!"
11915715,366625743,2019-01-03,10257531,Jennifer,We had a lovely time at the cottage! Was a great base for exploring the Barossa and the hospitality provided by Richard and family were second to none. The breakfast was one of the best we’ve had and the sunsets on the farm were stunning. Would definitely stay here again!
11915715,406748139,2019-01-30,95818245,Simon,"The cottage gets a 100% recommendation from us, the quiet location is great, the place is well equipped (good coffee machine and even a soda stream), stylish and immaculate. Richard gives a warm welcome and gave us some great local tips along with wonderful bread, farm fresh eggs and jams. Can not recommend it high enough"
11915715,414197892,2019-02-18,28214497,Helen,"If you want peace and tranquillity off the beaten track stay at Riverside Farm cottage where the animals are well cared for and allowed to roam free. <br/><br/>Lovely views and sunsets, you’ll enjoy seeing and hearing the birds and sheep right outside. Richard was kind enough to show us around the farm, introducing us to his friendly Chickens! You might spot one of the Maremma sheep dogs which guard the chickens or even an owl at dusk. The cottage was very homely and had everything we needed - nice and cool to come back to after a day in the heat. Check out the Barossa farmers market in Angaston - delicious produce! Thanks Richard for having us stay."
11915715,418766852,2019-03-03,157603294,Keren,This cottage is very quiet and private. A perfect place to unwind after a busy day in the Barossa Valley. There’s plenty of space and a great kitchen. We appreciated good air conditioning too. Highly recommended.
11915715,423067988,2019-03-13,308464,Chris,"The cottage was exactly what we were looking for!  Peaceful, serene, gorgeous views and very private.  The cottage itself was spacious, clean and had all the amenities we could possibly need.<br/><br/>Definitely sit under the stars at night.  There's no ambient light, so it's quite the show.<br/><br/>Also, be on the look out for kangaroos.  We saw two hop by during our stay."
11915715,516026886,2019-08-23,28427057,Patrick,"With its high ceilings, rendered walls and terracotta tiled floors, it was easy to imagine oneself in a sprawling Tuscan villa – although the views of lush rolling hills and valleys out each grand window served as a constant and breathtaking reminder that you were indeed in the heart of the Barossa. A truly beautiful house and a postcard worthy location, the Cottage was the ideal base-camp from which to explore the region and sample all it has to offer (a task made easier by Richard’s fantastic tips on local eateries!). From the lambs next to the house, to the welcome basket of local produce, our stay was filled with little touches that helped us relax, decompress, and settle into the Barossa pace of life...a glass of Shiraz near the fire certainly didn’t hurt, either!"
11915715,521386336,2019-09-01,156510144,Greg & Anne,"The Cottage is a fantastic place to stay for a weekend in the Barossa, very stylish and secluded.  We had a very relaxing time there."

Thoroughly recommend this place!"
11915715,637974768,2020-07-14,242675580,Jim,A lovely cottage in a truly beautiful farm setting. We loved walking by the creek watching kangaroos and soaring eagles and then returning to sit in the cosy sitting room warmed by the fire.
11915715,643509571,2020-07-28,27129566,Graham,A perfect spot for a quiet getaway. <br/>Still close handy to all the Barossa Valley charms.<br/>Perfect

Her communication was excellent, home absolutely gorgeous and I highly recommend Jacqueline and her home for a short or long stay."
12192423,72320767,2016-05-02,23965628,Emma,"Jacqueline and her assistant Judy were really communicative in the lead up to our stay at the barn and this made finding the property and gaining access to it a smooth process. The barn is a stunning, unique space full of  original artwork and gorgeous soft furnishings. We did feel as if we had stepped into the pages of a design magazine! At the same time, however, the barn still felt homely and relaxed. Many of the original features such as the cattle trough and exposed brickwork remain. We were welcomed with a selection of provisions including milk, bread and other sweet treats. Kapunda was an excellent base for exploring the Barossa and we couldn't recommend staying at the Barn highly enough. Thanks Jacqueline."
12192423,78062893,2016-06-05,6722350,Corinna,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying in the barn. It was a beautiful, cosy, clean and perfect for a large group to enjoy dinner around the big kitchen table or relax in front of the fire. Jacqueline was very welcoming, leaving breakfast provisions and a fire laid. She also dropped in on the first day and shared lots of helpful tips and ideas for things to do locally. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. "
12192423,80974890,2016-06-20,67871129,Thiru,"Wow is all I can say, what a beautiful place, it was warm cozy yet colourful and artistic! There is not one element of the barn that I would change it was a magical stay and the fact it was only a short drive away from the main areas of the barrossa meant we could enjoy the great wineries and come back out of the  hustle bustle and sit by the fire and enjoy some great reds. The support also from Judy and Nicole was magnificent whenever we had a question they were right there to help out. Thanks guys for a wonderful stay!! I would recommend the barn to anyone!"
12192423,84326880,2016-07-06,15462435,Maria,The house was absolutely stunning and we loved the garden. For foodies the kitchen was well appointed to enable some home cooking<br/>The art work was beautiful and the place so tranquil- just what we needed. Ideal of you are looking to unwind 
12192423,85226117,2016-07-10,67690556,Christian,"A lovely place to stay with more than adequate resources available and extremely well equipped. It was a very clean house and was great to come back to after a short trip to the Barossa. Food provisions and a laid out fire were very welcoming and made the stay much nicer and more comfortable.  I highly recommend the house to anyone, Jacqueline and her assistant were easy to reach and the entire experience was very comfortable and extremely enjoyable. Thanks for the great stay!"
12192423,92070225,2016-08-07,1173506,Jamie,"A wonderful place. In fact, the photos don't do it justice. Jacqui was incredibly helpful too. Highly recommended."

12192423,102935353,2016-09-19,17490294,Natalia,"Such a beautiful relaxing stay. The barn is truly gorgeous with original art work hanging on the walls and a lovely rustic yet homely feel. Jacqueline was such a treat, messaging us tips and tricks of where to go and eat and telling us to make sure we enjoyed some wine in front of the fire and was always easily contactable. This property is one not to miss and definitely one I'll recommend to others and try come back to myself. "
12192423,103476765,2016-09-22,60701,Jasper,"A lovely and unique converted barn yard a short drive from the main Barossa Valley centre, we had a lovely stay just relaxing in front of the fireplace. Comms with Jacqueline were straightforward and the place was set up well for our arrival. Would highly recommend to others. "

12192423,114655711,2016-11-19,7726910,Yann,Great place - beautiful garden - spacious bedrooms. A delight.
12192423,123153546,2016-12-27,19466125,Lorna,We had an amazing time at the barn- it is absolutely beautiful and a really unique place to stay. Every room is beautifully decorated with plenty of amenities for everything you need! Jacqueline was also great with communication and gave us tips and advice. 
12192423,124026050,2016-12-31,61036063,Karlene,"We had a brilliant stay at Jacquelines gorgeously renovated barn! Would definitely recommend, we plan on heading back! "
12192423,136640622,2017-03-11,23823989,Tyson,"Such a unique and interesting home...very charming and comfortable.  <br/><br/>Bigger than I anticipated, for two of us the barn was huge.  Great property as well.  <br/><br/>It had everything we needed and the owner was very kind enough to include breakfast items and a bottle of wine.  Just a minute from town which was convenient.  <br/><br/>Two things to point out...<br/>1.  If you are (Website hidden by Airbnb) careful.   I walked away with a few lumps on my head from the beams in the upstairs bedroom/hallway.   <br/>2.  We had a few encounters with spiders...a few dead and a few alive.  We are cuty dwellers so this was an adjustment.  😀    <br/><br/>Highly recommend.  "
12192423,146182064,2017-04-21,41026495,Beau,Absolutely gorgeous location and the perfect place to stay for a trip to wine country. House was immaculate and homely - the perfect place to return to for a few after a day of visiting the local wineries. Jacqueline provided some delicious food and also had great recommendations for the region. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Barossa and would have no problems booking again. 
12192423,159869179,2017-06-11,10029038,David,"Jac' place is lovely, bigger than the photos show, and located in a large private garden. Unfortunately after we checked in late afternoon, we found there was no power to any GPO sockets due to a faulty breaker, so a majority of amenities not available. (E.g. loss of included breakfast supplies as fridge not working, unable to store cold drinks & food supplies we brought with us, unable to charge Phones/iPad, limited kitchen e.g no Fridge, Dishwasher, Kettle, Toaster, Microwave, no WiFi or TV, no Washer or Dryer, limited Wood Heating without fan, no Hair Dryer of Iron etc). This made the stay impractical. We were unable to easily resolve the fault after several calls/msgs & trying to reset the breaker ourselves. Unfortunately Jac was overseas and the local contacts provided were unable to assist. We are not claiming any compensation for first night, but have requested refund of second night as we checked out a day early. I should add that Jac was very apologetic, and we realise it was just very bad luck. "
12192423,173187009,2017-07-23,139976096,Kane,Amazing! Loved it
12192423,182541391,2017-08-15,22787557,Leanne,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Barn. It's  an awesome space with plenty of room. The gardens, the fire, the decor all made for a enjoyable short break from the city. Loved it❤️"
12192423,189491844,2017-09-02,48654348,Steve,Beautiful property. Cosy with the fireplace. Super romantic and cute. Everything you want for a weekend away 😊
12192423,197565646,2017-09-26,24804986,Holly & Alex,"Gorgeous creative home, which is completely private and makes a good base for following the wine trail. Enjoyed our time here and would stay again. Thanks Jacqueline "
12192423,221824697,2017-12-27,43056339,Michael,"Fantastic base for exploring the Barossa, wonderful & helpful host and one of the nicest places we've stayed at so far."
12192423,224682387,2018-01-04,12630128,Brent,"We found it randomly and it was a long way from where we were intending to stay. Once we saw the description of an old barn turned into a much loved & peaceful Home, we had to take a chance and give it a go.<br/>Jacqueline was excellent on email, all was considered so we didn’t go without but it was the unique and comfortable nature of the place that had us falling in love with it.<br/>A glass of the local, non labeled wine at night as the sky goes pink allows you to drift off to the south of France, with only the many pink Galahs to bring you back to a real Australian experience. <br/>We even read a few chapters of Jacqueline’s book (and later bought a copy) which explained why the place has so much love invested. <br/>Almost like an adventurous cubbiehouse, we highly recommend it for a lazy time to experience the Barossa. <br/>For us, it was our first holiday as a young family and the comforts allowed us to sleep on our 3 month old’s times. It made this special time in our lives very unique and well worth looking a little outside the vanilla box. <br/>Many thanks,<br/>Brent, Saraya and baby Havana"
12192423,253279264,2018-04-14,98512535,Karena,"Charming cottage. A tiny bit out of the ways but we managed with local taxis etc. Loved loved loved the house, styled beautifully, amazingly actually. Perfect touches like fruit, bread, butter etc. Would love to go back!"
12192423,275425191,2018-06-11,10789235,Elizabeth,"Jacqueline's Barn in the Barossa home was a lovely stay location over the June long weekend for our family of 3 (including our 1 year old, thank you for supplying us with a foldout cot!). It is a beautiful renovated barn with all the modern amenities, spacious yet cosy & we were toasty warm despite it being winter 😊 Good location to come home to after being out & about in the Barossa, would definitely recommend to others! 😊"
12192423,296478768,2018-07-26,71045869,Shelley,"Lots of quirky treasures to discover.  Main bedroom well heated by fireplace! Open spaces including spacious bathroom without screens, curtain or glass - just watch the overspray. Fabulous access to the Barossa and surrounds. Thanks Jacqueline!!"
12192423,301851585,2018-08-05,205779479,Angela,"Beautifully renovated and styled. The fire was very warm, downstairs and upstairs. About 20mins away from Barossa Valleh wineries and restaurants."
12192423,309894241,2018-08-19,191314144,Steven,"It was a very modern yet vintage space. Everything was very clean and well organized. It was very spacious and could easily fit 6 people. There was minimal artificial lighting to allow for the sky lights to fill the house with beautiful natural sun light. Although there was a stunning wood fire there was also 3 heaters spread throughout the home for added warmth. All the amenities were sparkling clean and the whole house was beautifully decorated to compliment the style of the home itself. There was a large book of recommendations for food and fun throughout the Barossa on arrival along with fresh eggs, bread, milk, orange juice, water chilled, tea, coffee and spreads amongst many others. It was a stunning space inside and out. It was so hard to say goodbye to and couldn't flaw a thing. "
12192423,339730740,2018-10-22,14957244,Catherine,"This is a lovely and unique place to stay in the Barossa; you'll feel as though you are in the south of France. And the mix of arty and rustic decor is very attractive.  Spacious bedrooms and very comfortable bed.  It's an easy drive to the wineries and eateries in the area, and the town of Kapunda has its own history and charm. Jacqueline provided some great tips for activities you might not discover on  your own as well as info on places to eat."
12192423,365953220,2019-01-02,23754972,Brett,We had a lovely stay here! Location was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone. On our arrival the fridge was nicely stocked with some brekkie goodies which was highly appreciated.
12192423,419436828,2019-03-03,4082566,Tracey,"Beautiful barn, creative touches and restful place. Lovely fresh eggs and supplies for breakfast definitely recommended."
12192423,440445799,2019-04-21,12398041,Alexander,Loved this place. Would stay here again if we returned to the Barossa
12192423,442594644,2019-04-24,49586874,Madeleine,"Pictures do not do this gorgeous barn justice. Had the most relaxing weekend away, close to the wineries and was great to come back here and have a wine outside and enjoy the garden. Great place!"
12192423,467030964,2019-06-10,79236162,Ashleigh,Great stay!
12192423,482718974,2019-07-07,73483439,Adam,"Such a wonderful place! Very stylish and had great amenities/facilities, and Jacqueline was really fast with responses and any questions we’d had. Lovely hospitality, perfectly situated, and well maintained and perfectly presented. Do not hesitate!"
12192423,484939809,2019-07-10,9552607,Kim,A lovely stay not too far from the vineyards. Fridge stocked with goodies and loads of fire wood.
12192423,506674041,2019-08-11,13120592,Catherine,"Jacqueline's place is charming. The converted barn is full of character. Jaqueline had stocked the place with snacks, juice, milk, wine etc for our arrival. The weekend was cold with 4 degrees overnight but we were very snug with the heaters and very effective pot belly fire. Check in was smooth and Jaqueline communicated fantastically. The accommodation is the prefect base to discover the Barossa but also a great place to hang out and enjoy dinners in."
12192423,516889079,2019-08-25,276253413,Will,Had a lovely weekend at the barn and would definitely come back when I have the chance. Good location and a great space to enjoy a few glasses of wine.
12192423,542967778,2019-10-06,59289813,Estelle,Charming Barn in the Barossa
12192423,564928726,2019-11-16,293507167,Anthea,"The barn is an old world charm<br/>so peaceful, birds chirping, yet all you need at your finger tips.<br/>great place to rest , unwind and relax"
12192423,583609739,2019-12-29,15163948,Theresa,"Nice clean stay, well air conditioned"
12192423,598386684,2020-01-27,45350499,Emma,"We had such a wonderful girls weekend away at Jacquelines place.  The barn is absolutely beautiful and would equally be lovely for a romantic couples holiday.  It was very homely and had everything we needed.  Before we arrived, Jacqueline let us know the barn was having some wifi issues, so she left a bottle of rose in the fridge for us.  It was this open communication and personal touches that made the stay that much more special.  Would return without hesitation!"
12192423,628419666,2020-06-08,6071956,Kelly,This place is far grander than the photos. Simply stunning with wonderful hosts and a beautiful garden surrounding.
12192423,637051561,2020-07-12,199880540,Jack,Had a fantastic stay. The barn is exactly what we needed for a get away. Great location to go out and explore the surrounding area. Jacquline was always quick to reply and super helpful.
12192423,639678068,2020-07-19,187368245,Gabrielle,Awesome relaxing place to stay for a quiet getaway. Fireplace is amazing and Jacquelines communication was fantastic. Watch out when using the shower though because the floor will get wet.
12192423,648507165,2020-08-09,5479131,Paula,"A calm, beautiful and cozy home that was just what we needed for a weekend away. Jacqueline was very thoughtful  and helpful especially when it came to local recommendations. We loved the place so much we’ve recommended it to friends and family looking for a getaway from the city. Looking forward to staying there again next time :)"
12192423,652531662,2020-08-17,5393169,Juliet,"A lovely old barn building in Kapunda, near the Barossa, this is a wonderful spot to stay in an interesting old copper mining town. <br/>Very beautifully appointed, warm and full of paintings and treasures, the house is comfortable and generally well appointed- log fire and bath being my two ‘must haves’ for a lazy weekend away in winter.  The house is very spacious and it also has a gorgeous rambling garden that hints of a much loved history. It would be a wonderful spot for meals in summer I’m sure…<br/>There are most basic provisions available, but If you are planning to cook and eat in (and there’s good reason to stay in and enjoy the cozy old-world charm here) I would suggest bringing a good cooking pot with lid and any special bits you might need for cooking. Some of the plumbing is a bit impractical (no shower curtain in the bathroom with a lovely rain shower over the bath makes showering a very wet event, and the kitchen sink is easy to flood with the tap position), but these are small details that I mention only so you are ready for them!<br/>I would happily return. Thanks Jacqeline!"
12192423,668264442,2020-09-27,209639301,Craig,"Jacquline’s Barn is a beautiful & peaceful space & was perfect for our family of 4 with 2 teenagers. We enjoyed the lovely surroundings, unique furnishings, artwork & the generous breakfast provisions. It is a short drive to the Barossa Valley."
12192423,671395258,2020-10-04,31125053,Neil,"Very nice, would stay again."
12192423,673094635,2020-10-11,45725849,Elgar,"This is an excellent place to stay, I could not more strongly recommend it. Jacqueline has done an incredible job on the place. The garden, living and kitchen areas and welcoming mezzanine bedrooms. We also appreciated her hospitality and extras. Well located with a drive to the wine regions and other towns. Great place, thanks for having us."
12192423,705571961,2020-10-31,4958232,Jennifer,Amazing place! Thoughtful and artistic touches and breakfast provisions. Garden is beautiful and great stable conversion design. Will be back for sure
12192423,718971850,2020-12-27,361532,Sandris,"We had the best time at the barn and beautiful Christmas. What a gem it is and central to everything in Barossa. It is bigger (inside and outside) than showed in the photos - plenty of space for a big family or enough intimacy for a couple.<br/><br/>This was like staying in my Italian country home (which I never had). Jacqueline has made sure this place has everything, including original artwork around the barn. We'll be back!"
12192423,721809674,2021-01-04,9341512,Teeghan,"Jacqueline’s place was lovely, full of personal touches and beautiful artwork. The beds were so comfy! My one caution would be that the lightning is very dark in the bathroom (I’m vision impaired, this was fine during the day but problematic at night) and the stairs are (as expected and noted in the listing) narrow and steep. <br/>All in all we loved our stay at Jacqueline’s place and would recommend to anyone looking for a base close to the Barossa but away from the crowds of Tanunda."
12192423,722894789,2021-01-08,17131462,Dale,"The architecture of the barn is amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the garden.  Unfortunately that is where it stops.  <br/><br/>The barn itself was  dirty and needed TLC. For instance the bathroom was dirty with the toilet having pubic hair on the seat and under the seat - It also was unclean to touch, hair in the bath, and tiles.  The bed had hair in it. The kitchen was filthy and needed cleaning. The plates, cups and mugs also needed a clean before use, dust everywhere and a there were a few spiders in the pots and pans.  We also could not close the windows in the roof with birds nesting in there it made for a very echoing and noisy night!"
12192423,747606411,2021-04-11,145237284,Maurice,The house has lovely rustic charm and has some nice touches.  It is set in a quiet area of town and if you are older I suggest you have a vehicle available to go shopping as the supermarket is quite a hike.  The grounds are quite large but on out visit the driveways were becoming overgrown and could have done with a tidy up.  The upstairs area is nice and roomy but there is a bit of water spill when showering as the shower is over a free standing bath.  The stairs are steep but manageable with a good handrail. The touches that were supplied in food and the accommodating nature that allowed for early check in was appreciated.
12192423,748793296,2021-04-15,109048159,Jayne,Brilliant. Spacious. Welcoming. Warm. Highly recommended.
12192423,752263735,2021-04-26,63701378,Sarah,"We loved our stay at the Barn. The photos truly don’t do it justice, it was much bigger than we expected. The Barn itself and garden were lovely. Jacqueline was a wonderful host and provided us with ample food, drinks and info. We would definitely stay here again"
12192423,756314872,2021-05-09,249717539,Amy,"Really enjoyed our stay, Barn in the Barossa is such a dream place to stay. Jacqueline recommendations of place to see and eat were brilliant"
12192423,758572798,2021-05-16,69282560,Daryl,Lovey get away. Awesome host. Quick responsive and loved the little extras
12192423,761184986,2021-05-22,121163336,Liz,A beautifuland tranquil place to stay .  The fireplace was all ready to go when we arrived late in the day.  Amazing variety of art work to admire.  Can’t wait to rebooand explore the area more.
12192423,763944480,2021-05-30,388766109,Josslyn,One of the nicest places I have stayed at  - you’ll feel welcome from the moment you walk through the door.
12192423,770330492,2021-06-14,75680089,Jamie,"Well worth the stay, lovely place for a few days away."
12192423,387883715138906601,2021-06-19,36484700,Tammy,The Barn is a unique place and we loved being able to stay in a place that was full of interesting things and had an interesting history.  The fireplace was so cosy to sit in front of with the added advantage that it warmed our loft bedroom so well.  Great location for us to explore both the Barossa and the Clare Valley.
12192423,403858527713473397,2021-07-11,224092706,Jess,Enjoyed the stay! Cute spot and very thoughtful touches including the fresh produce in the fridge.
12192423,424185303999660769,2021-08-08,3699379,Kate,Lovely spot for access to Kapunda and surrounding areas. The barn and fire were well-stocked. Slightly less ‘rural’ than we expected but the garden was lovely.
12192423,435083286414238192,2021-08-23,83438477,Tom,"A beautiful barn conversion in a quiet town, Jacqueline was a great host- easy to contact and quick to reply. The breakfast provisions were a lovely touch. The house is well equipped and there’s plenty of room to relax, the wood burner fireplace worked a treat and the garden was beautiful. Great spot for a break."
12192423,439348498196018160,2021-08-29,292183342,Jayvee,Jacquelines cottage is everything you could ever dream of! the place is immaculate and very comforting which is exactly what you need for a little getaway or even just to have some leisure time in the barossa!
12192423,443775380383513016,2021-09-04,51795006,Travis,Lovely place. Perfect for anyone that wants a quiet weekend away whilst still remaining close to all there is to see up in the Barossa and surrounds.<br/>The facilities provided and the setup of the property was delightful and perfectly put together.
12192423,454628329087273250,2021-09-19,117247116,Anneliese,The barn was very clean and tidy and had everything we needed for a quick getaway. Location was close to town but on a road that could be noisy at times - there was also no curtain on the bedroom window so hopefully no one saw us from the main road! The barn was a great place to relax but could do with a bit of TLC/refreshing. The fireplace was amazing and overall our stay was comfortable.
12192423,461879589245169986,2021-09-29,6071956,Kelly,"This is our second time staying here and I don’t think it will be the last. The place is open and bright, yet cosy. It feels rustic and relaxed, yet luxurious. It seems perfectly set up for two couples or young families, but we love it as a getaway just for us. <br/><br/>The scented candles, fresh towels, and big bath make it feel like you’re in a luxury spa. <br/><br/>I absolutely love the skylights with natural light everywhere. <br/><br/>It’s well set up for cooking and relaxing. We barely left to explore the wineries as we were so well set up in the barn :)"
12192423,463992368015891555,2021-10-02,39751220,Daniel,An excellent space in a sleepy little town a stones throw from Barossa and not far from the Clare Valley. Recommend a soak in the tub and a night by the fire after a day touring the wineries.
12192423,530616026971194492,2022-01-01,246342437,Ryan,Very nice place! We loved our stay 👌
12192423,532838392697619548,2022-01-04,18492211,Hayley,A gorgeous character stay in a wonderful part of SA. We booked the barn for a quick getaway from Adelaide and couldn't be happier with our stay in such a gorgeous place. Jacqueline also had plenty of suggestions on what to do (and eat) while we were there.
12856765,77288667,2016-05-31,56238985,Natalie,"We had a great couple of days away at this accommodation. Lots of room for a couple of families, kids had a ball in the big back yard & exploring down the creek.  Spa bath was an added bonus. Robyn was extremely helpful and loved all the little extras too, breakfast was glorious. Thanks for a great stay Robyn & Andrew, would highly recommend and we will be back. "
12856765,79770738,2016-06-14,15991112,Julie,"We stayed here with 2 other couples over the June long weekend & had such a wonderful relaxing time. <br/>Robyn & Andrew thought of everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. <br/>The house is very clean,  tidy & spacious. After we cooked dinner in the full sized kitchen and bbq out side, we all sat infront of the fire place in the lounge or played boardgames on the big dining room table. <br/>It's really close to the main street in Angaston so we could walk down and visit the local shops.<br/>The bed were very comfortable, the hosts are very easy to deal with and the scenery is beautiful & relaxing.<br/>Thanks for a great stay Robyn & Andrew"
12856765,80852510,2016-06-20,74560988,Sarah,Couldn't fault one thing about our stay at winter by the creek! Robyn made our stay so welcoming and enjoyable. We will be back and will highly recommended it to our friends and family. Thankyou once again Robyn 
12856765,81656804,2016-06-24,77215790,Martine,Hosting and responsiveness great. Spa and fire made it. Will be back and highly recommend.
12856765,82110115,2016-06-26,47530036,Bryony,"We had an excellent trip to the barossa. Robyn was there to show us around when we got there. She had provided us with an amazing cheese and wine spread, beautiful breakfast selection and some local biscuits. It was more then we expected. The house was super comfy with enough space for 7 of us. <br/>The only thing was the smoke detector kept going off with cooking but there is a BBQ outside.<br/>Definitely recommend this place "
12856765,83813711,2016-07-04,10182874,Liz,"Everything about our stay was just perfect. Couldn't recommend more. Robyn & Andrew went above & beyond to make our stay smooth and comfortable. From coming over to help with the fire, to organising a driver, to providing the most wonderful welcome hamper... We fell in love<br/>With the place & hope to come back one day. Thank you!"
12856765,85165507,2016-07-10,74091539,Allison,"Hi Robyn & Andrew, thanks for a lovely stay. We had a great time in Angaston, drinking wine, relaxing and eating yummy cheeses. We were very impressed with the home we stayed in for 5 nights. The wood fire was extremely cosy and the jaccuzi was a pleasant way to end each cold night. Some lovely extra touches were included in the stay and this was much appreciated.  Highly recommended. Thank you :)"
12856765,87307818,2016-07-19,47594948,Andrew,Robyn was very helpful in communicating about our needs for disabled access.  The provisions were excellent and a huge basket of fruit was provided.  There is plenty of wood for the log fire which ran all the time and kept the house warm and cosy in winter.
12856765,90442036,2016-08-01,72076864,Jessica,"Thanks Robyn for such a lovely retreat.  The house was lovely and warm on arrival, fire glowing, and lovely and generous breakfast provisions for both days.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and would definitely return again (with or without the kids!)"
12856765,93927226,2016-08-14,54937698,Roger,Robyn was a fantastic and friendly host. Great communicator. Location in Angaston was very convenient. Fresh eggs each day from the chooks were delicious. BBQ was great. Backyard fire pit was great. House was warm with great heating options. Beds and rooms were large and comfortable. House was clean and well presented. TV was excellent and lounge chairs very comfortable. Showers hot and water pressure excellent. Bathrooms will need new tiles fairly soon but no big deal. Highly recommend Robyn's place. 
12856765,97512643,2016-08-27,23688343,Ian,"<br/>Wow! On entry to the property you are taken back by the amazing gardens and warmness of this cosy log cabin. Equally amazing is the kind and friendly host, Robyn, whom goes the “extra mile” for ensuring a comfortable, relaxing, trouble free stay. From being greeted with a food platter with wine to assistance with re-starting the log fire, you truly feel the host has considered your every need. <br/>I booked this place for my wife’s surprise birthday getaway with our three daughters (aged 6 to 12) for two nights. And Yes, in her eyes, I hit a home run :) The only regret was not booking for longer!  The place itself is centrally located in Angaston and fully equipped to accommodate for all your needs, regardless of age. I highly recommend this listing if you are looking to treat yourself to a peaceful and relaxing escape  in one of South Australia's oldest towns. <br/>Thank-you Robyn & Andrew for opening up your beautiful home! We had the most amazing experience and look forward to returning in the near future. <br/>The Saumi’s. <br/>"

12856765,101037814,2016-09-11,9151210,Cortney,"This place could not be more magical. We had six guests stay and there was so much room and the place was absolutely gorgeous. Think the perfect swiss chalet in the middle of the Barossa. Angaston is the perfect location to access the Barossa, and there were little cafes and restaurants close by for the days we didn't want to leave. Honestly - everything about this place is exceptional. "
12856765,104404294,2016-09-26,33006135,David,Robyn was very understanding and helpful despite last minute changes. The  house was perfect for the weekend.
12856765,106783598,2016-10-08,83021631,Lee-Anne,"Robyn was the perfect host. She welcomed my family into her home with a smile. <br/>My children loved every moment and had the best time exploring the garden and creek. <br/>Robyn had games and toys for them play with on rainy days. <br/>The delicious nibbles and wine for the adults were enjoyed and a lovely touch. <br/>The fire was warm and welcoming on our arrival. <br/>Robyn went out of her way to help organise meat trays and birthday cakes, which she kindly offered to collect and was waiting for us when we arrived. <br/>Robyn also assisted us with directions to her property and helped with information on doctors when our daughter became sick. I can not fault her helpfulness. <br/>The location was perfect, with just a short walk to shops and playgrounds. <br/>The house was comfortable and warm and well stocked with everything needed for family life. <br/>I totally recommend this property to anyone wanting a peaceful break away in the Barossa. <br/>You couldn't ask for a nicer host.

The house was set up perfectly, breakfast and snacks supplied was full of local, first-rate delicacies. Robyn supplied us with lots of tips on what  to do during our trip that we found very useful. The house itself was perfect for our long weekend visit, hot tub, fluffy towels and plenty of games and dvd's. Our kids were particularly delighted with being able to collect eggs from the chickens each morning! We had an excellent stay, would highly recommend!"

Robyn was a fabulous host, everything was there for us, we just had to arrive with the attitude of having a great time! We did just that.  The weather was perfect, the spa was utilised and the grassy patch in the garden was a lovely place to spend Saturday afternoon, indulging in local produce we had collected throughout that day.  Breakfast supplies were ample and attention to detail made our stay homely and comfortable.  Thankyou from all of us ""the bookclub""!"

Very central for all that you may want to see and do around the Barossa.  <br/>Our host Robyn - one word again - PERFECT, fantastic communication from first contact, very flexible with our booking as we weren't sure on how many were staying with us right up until the last few days but Robyn was very accommodating<br/>Our welcome - warm and homely as soon as we walked in the door, with the wine and cheese on the dining table to  farm fresh local produce breakfast ingredients in the fridge - and that was just the beginning - there was nothing for us to think about, right down to the fluffy white bath robes and slippers!!.. <br/>Great experience, great house and fantastic to share with friends and family, would highly recommend...and already have :) "

We'll definitely be keeping this accomodation in mind for our next trip to the Barossa. Thankyou!!"

12856765,116822012,2016-12-03,4636410,Wendy,"We ( 3 couples)  just spent a lovely week end in the Barossa. <br/><br/>Angaston by the Winter Creek was a rare find with 4 bedrooms,  3 of which had queen beds and 2 + bathrooms. This in itself is not the norm and is what attracted us to the home as well as its outside area of BBQ, spa and eating area. <br/><br/>We appreciated Robyn's  effort with the breakfast, nibbles and wine left for us to enjoy and the high quality products for guest's use in bathrooms. <br/><br/>An enjoyable stay. <br/>"
12856765,120106249,2016-12-07,41951903,Shayne,Robyn would have to be rated as a fantastic host.  The additional extra touches were greatly appreciated by the whole family.

12856765,121771081,2016-12-18,59677313,Sue,"House was quirky, with everything we needed for 5 adults. Local pantry items were tasty. Gardens hard to leave for other destinations. Handy to wineries and good choices for dining. A lovely weekend place."
12856765,122956986,2016-12-26,2530283,Marianne,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay over Christmas. The house was perfect for our needs - plenty of room for 5 adults, close walking distance to angaston's main street, and very effective air conditioning. The lovely back deck and beautifully maintained grounds were a bonus. We were particularly impressed by how well stocked the kitchen was - so many lovely local treats and loads of quality kitchenware and wine glasses. Check in was a breeze and Robyn went out of her way to assist and make us feel welcome (she even put up a delightful little Christmas tree for us!). A great experience all round. "
12856765,123549790,2016-12-29,106191411,Nathan,"This place is peaceful, quiet and tastefully decorated and equipped for a great get-away. Certainly a thoughtful host. "

Robyn even provided some treats and sparklers for our NYE celebrations!<br/>One of the most difficult decisions we faced was choosing our rooms! All are lovely and have their advantages!<br/>The property offers many different areas where you can play sport, suntan, lounge, spa, eat, bbq and in the colder months even sit around a fire pit! Luckily we had three nights to try a bit of everything in the beautiful warm weather.<br/>Even though the property is in the sweet suburbs of Angaston, it feels like a secluded farm retreat. You can walk to the local shops in 5 minutes.<br/>We loved our stay and would love to come back!"
12856765,125269994,2017-01-04,3023184,Lee,"Robyn was a wonderful host, she takes care of every little detail to make sure your stay is perfect. The property and home is very lovely, clean and well equipped. W e especially enjoyed the garden and spa. It's a 10 minute stroll or very short car ride to the shopping strip of Angaston.

12856765,128986409,2017-01-28,86665949,Lou,"We had a group come to stay for several nights and had a wonderful time at the house.  The spa was amazing and the hosts provided us with lots of outdoor entertainment (backyard cricket, croquet, etc) on the beautiful green grass outside - which was also nice for sitting back and relaxing! We were welcomed with many good surprises - wine, cheese, fresh fruit, breakfast, delicious biscuits, plus more.  It was a very spacious house fitting our group of 3 couples nicely.  Robyn was very accommodating to our needs and was able to help us organise some meat from the local butchers (delicious!) as well as provide us with information regarding transport during our stay.  We would highly recommend!! "
12856765,131615955,2017-02-12,415780,Helen,"This was my best AirBnB experience ever, and I've stayed in homes all over the world. The house was excellent, even better than in the photos, and Robyn was an incredibly thoughtful host- the snacks and treats were a lovely surprise, and one we were very grateful for after a long drive! A lovely area, and the house is a short walk to the the little high street with a couple of cafes, pubs, a wine bar and restaurant, not to mention the excellent cheese shop that is well worth a visit. If I could give six stars I would. "
12856765,133991137,2017-02-25,20921553,Sarah,"This place is amazing. Robyn is so friendly, helpful and fantastic to deal with. The house is big and a great space for entertaining. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "

12856765,137349647,2017-03-14,98720636,Fay,This property is close to the main street of beautiful Angaston.  It is spacious.  The children enjoyed the spa very much.  The breakfast supplies were amazing.  
12856765,139140965,2017-03-23,114284413,Grant,"Angaston on the Winter Creek is a wonderful, comfortable place to stay, and Robyn is a generous and gracious host. We were struck by how well appointed the house was, and how much was available in the way of housewares, linen and towels, and so on. Also, Robyn was very generous with the breakfast provisions and other pantry items she left. She is going to be a hard act to follow."
12856765,139546239,2017-03-25,30569411,Marika,"We were blown away by the beautiful log-cabin style house and stunning garden and surrounds. Although two streets away from the Main Street in Angaston, the location was very quiet. Angaston was the only interesting town in the Barossa this weekend--all the others closed their shops at 12 noon. The house was roomy and comfortable--with 4 double beds in 4 bedrooms--perfect for groups of friends. There are only two rooms that are next to each other, the others are spaced out around the house. There is a huge 8 person spa with TV and dining table under the private veranda out the back. Inside there is a kitchen w a generous amount of provisions for breakfast and other treats!! There is a Nescafé coffee pod machine and gas stove and all the cooking utensils you could need to cook a dinner party! There is a huge dinner table for 10 and you can relax in the lounge room later with massive TV and dvds. We just loved it there and it was a hit with our guests too. Just book it you'll love it!!"
12856765,142577049,2017-04-08,19542573,Nicole,"Where to begin!! Robyn and Andrew's house is perfect for a group of friends looking to enjoy the Barossa from a beautiful and comfortable base. The house is just a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston and a 20 minute drive to most of the Barossa wineries, but is in a quiet neighbourhood on a large block.<br/><br/>The house is decked out with everything you could possible need. The linens are lovely, it is spotlessly clean and there are plenty of things to do in the house - games, cricket, a spa, sound system and a huge TV (great for footy). There is also an open fire which would be amazing in winter (it was way too hot when we were there).<br/><br/>Robyn really is the hostess with the most! She left the fridge full of delicious Barossa goodies including wine, cheese, eggs, bacon, fresh bread, tim tams, fruit, vegetables and even Maggie Beer icecreams! We had a delightful breakfast in the garden alongside the creek one morning. Robyn also offered to help out wiht transport (which in a wine region is a huge plus).<br/><br/>We will definitely be back. Robyn's place was great value, accurately described and the hospitality was second to none.<br/><br/>Angaston is a great base for the Barossa - it's small and quaint but has everything you need. We ate at the Wine Bar in town which was excellent and visited the farmers market on Saturday morning - amazing. <br/><br/>Thank you so much Robyn and Andrew! We will see you again. Kind Regards, Nicole, Noel, Josie, Ben, Martine and Dave.<br/>"
12856765,143650537,2017-04-12,116136210,Taryn,"We had a great stay here. Leading up to our holiday, Robyn went above and beyond to provide up with email information about the house and the local area. Check in was easy and Robyn even made the effort to come by and show us around the house and how everything worked (e.g. The awesome spa!). The house had more than enough space for our group, with a large kitchen for cooking as well as huge indoor and outdoor dining tables. Robyn provided loads of local foodie treats, like smoked bacon from the local butcher and wine from a local vineyard. We would definitely return for another holiday."
12856765,144942174,2017-04-16,24207378,Natalie,"Robyn's place is AMAZING. We had two couples stay there but you could easily accomodate another four people / two couples in the house as there's a lot of space both inside and out. Robyn has thought of everything in this place, from a lovely welcome snack, to outside dining and fire pit, games corner, awesome home theatre, even a karaoke machine! There's a great kitchen if you love to cook as it has all the essentials and more. It is the perfect house for a fun relaxing getaway but also close enough to walk into town if you feel like venturing out. We based ourselves there for four days and it was a nice easy drive to a whole range of amazing wineries. The house is perfect, I would highly recommend it, and it's made even better by Robyn's helpfulness and thoughtfulness. We will definitely be back! "
12856765,145956050,2017-04-20,7062663,Deborah,Great house for a family or group of people! Central location for the Barossa and close to the shops in the lovely town of Angaston. Robyn left us little surprises and I would highly recommend this property to anyone!

12856765,151670233,2017-05-13,72429626,Anthony,"Angaston by Winter Creek is exactly as described. It is super spacious, yet very cosy, especially with the combustion heater. Robyn met us at the house and gave us suggestions about where to go and what to do. The house was very clean and the fridge was stocked with local produce. It is also in the perfect location, just behind the main street of Angaston. We would definitely be back.  Thanks Robyn."
12856765,152518177,2017-05-17,124337940,Yi,"Clean, spacious, warm, cosy, well equipped house with unique structure. Enthusiastic, detailed host. She even prepared special bath gel and sweets for my son! Thanks Robyn, this is one of the best stay I have ever had!"

12856765,157416383,2017-06-03,125494882,Kylie,"Robyn is a terrific hostess and has a gorgeous place! I celebrated my 30th birthday in the Barossa with 6 friends at the beginning of winter and her cabin-style home was perfect. <br/><br/>-There were local treats left in the fridge, freezer and kitchen in case anyone needs a snack after their journey or before stepping out for groceries/dining locally. <br/>-The property was adequately heated (it was the beginning of winter) but if you are still cold there were robe options, throw blankets and slippers. <br/>-The main street is just one block over and is a very short walk. <br/>-It easily fit 7 people without feeling crowded at all. <br/>-The grounds are gorgeous and there are outdoor dining options (we had our final breakfast near the hen house on the outside tables in the sun, it was amazing). <br/>-If anything is on in town or the surrounding towns, Robyn is very considerate and will let you know in case you'd like to add it to your itinerary.<br/>-It sounds silly but I was worried if there'd be enough towels for the spa, but I needn't have! There were plenty of big beach towels for all of us and still plenty of bathroom towels to shower with. <br/><br/>Thank you for allowing us to have an absolutely wonderful experience in your airBnB home! I cannot recommend it enough!<br/>"
12856765,159860511,2017-06-11,47373117,Wendy,Thank you for allowing us to stay at such a wonderful home. The food and goodies were a pleasant surprise.

Thank you and we highly recommend to anyone looking to hire this place go for it! "
12856765,182517012,2017-08-14,38880676,Chiara,"We had 4 couples stay at Robyn's house for 3 nights and we couldn't fault the experience. Robyn made check in very easy and walked us through the house. She stocked the fridge with amazing local produce for us to have breakfast cook ups including fresh eggs from her chooks in the backyard. The house has a lovely outdoor spa and she supplied 8 fluffy robes to make the experience feel even more luxurious. Robyn also supplied body wash, shampoos and all the little necessities in case you forgot to pack! The fire pit in the backyard can be used for $25 extra per night and is well worth it! The house is located a short walk from angaston town and this was a perfect location to access the Barossa wineries each day! Overall an absolutely wonderful stay that I would recommend to anyone!"
12856765,185128107,2017-08-21,118647580,Denise,"Robyn greeted us when we arrived, and provided us with a thorough overview of the houses amenities, and even started a fire for us.

We visited with a 1 and a 3 year old and they loved the beautiful yard and daily trips to the chook pen. The house is clean, comfortable and well stocked with the essentials including a great selection of cheese, and local produce and a delicious breakfast platter. Robyn has thought of everything and provided clean and safe children's equipment and linen. A great location in the heart of Angaston in easy walking distance to the amenities and restaurants. Look no further, you've found your B'N'B!!"
12856765,209970757,2017-11-06,16224493,Allan,Robyns place was simply fantastic. It was the ideal place to base our group get together in the Barossa Valley. The accomodation is as described in the pictures. All communication with Robyn was easy and she was quick to respond. Check in was simple.  We all agreed that we should return if ever back in the region. Would definately recommend. Allan
12856765,215295590,2017-11-28,52906123,Monique,Robyn went above andbeyond to make our stay enjoyable.  in each room there were small additions and special touches that made us feel at home and allowed us to relax and enjoy our stay.  By far the best Airbnb my family has been to thus far
12856765,216466668,2017-12-04,53669629,Paul,"Robyn certainly went out of her way to accommodate us. Lots of yummy food, a bottle of wine, flowers and nice soaps etc. were appreciated.  An upstairs bathroom would be good, but plenty of room and the spa was nice. Cheers."
12856765,217531990,2017-12-09,47594948,Andrew,Very nice place with great entertaining areas outside.
12856765,220136303,2017-12-20,95632635,Kate,"Perfectly located home for exploring the Barossa and then relaxing at the end of the day.  Great outdoor entertaining area and spacious garden area.  Superb hospitality including wine, cheeses and breakfast items. Robyn made sure we had everything we needed for our stay, including accomodating our very young children (e.g: high chair etc).  Her tips for enjoying the area were really helpful too.  Fabulous!"
12856765,222131186,2017-12-29,132396837,Giselle,"Communication was excellent and especially the extra touches of fresh flowers,  breakfast provisions including fresh eggs, cheese platter and special ice cream treats - all very much appreciated.  Also having an Expresso coffee machine was great and saved us searching for that ""elusive great coffee"" in the area.  Robyn also offered to arrange fresh seafood for us for the festive season which was another unexpected gesture.  Would love to visit again in Winter. for that really warm and cozy experience.    Giselle"
12856765,223157955,2017-12-31,39282635,Elizabeth,"Good clean accommodation and excellent breakfast provisions plus extras such as a bottle of wine.  Lovely table setting outside and great lawn area.  Angaston was a bit quiet on New Year's Eve, not that it worried us."

12856765,232885129,2018-02-06,18143813,Shauna,Really nice and quirky cabin. Looks like a lovely place for a couple families... big yard that we didn’t use! Appreciated the wine & cheese on arrival.

12856765,249221952,2018-04-01,51981833,Brayds,"Robyn was extremely helpful and communicated well throughout our stay. Her house is beautifully furnished and comfortable, and was topped by Robyn’s generous hamper left in the fridge along with some delicious port! Excellent stay, highly recommended!"
12856765,253631326,2018-04-15,82604651,Kelly,Robyn was a lovely easy going person to communicate with and helped us in anyway she could. The breakfast and cheese platter were amazing and the BBQ dinner (optional extra) was superb and would recommend to take up the offer for a little extra money was totally worth it. Very relaxing place to stay. We loved every minute of it. Thank you again Robyn
12856765,258243833,2018-04-29,173899013,Joanne,Great location and house has a lovely homely feel . Robyn is an excellent host. Nothing is too much trouble.

12856765,274714530,2018-06-10,3021297,Martin,"Absolutely fabulous, we had 3 generations sharing this wonderful home. Beautiful inside and out,  Robyn welcomed us with a great spread of local produce so no need to do any shopping the night we arrived. The only problem was we werent there long to really settle in and just enjoy the place."
12856765,280706442,2018-06-24,182999905,Genevieve,"This was a lovely place to stay for my friends and my long weekend in the Barossa Valley.  There were lots of nice touches to the property and Robyn was a great host.<br/>My friends and I loved the spa, fireplace and overall ambience of the house and garden."
12856765,298887454,2018-07-30,40362603,Sarah,Robyn was so helpful and the place had everything we needed and more. My kids and husband suffer badly from asthma and this house was spotlessly clean and they had no problems breathing at all! We got the bbq pack and it was absolutely fantastic fresh and tasty food! Everything was easy! We’d definitely stay here again! 
12856765,302672254,2018-08-06,6921124,Richard And Dianne,"We were a group of four ladies spending a long weekend in the Barossa.  We were so pleased we chose Robyn's place to stay.  We each had our own comfortable room with electric blankets, very comfortable bed and pillows.  The living area was warm and cosy and there was plenty of wood supplied for the fireplace.<br/>Robyn was extremely generous with the provisions supplied and the kitchen had all the appliances you would need.  As well, there were plenty of glasses, plates, cutlery etc.  We spent our first night sampling the bottle of very nice Shiraz left for our enjoyment.  The gardens and grounds of Robyn's house are beautiful and would imagine they would be more so in the Spring and Summer months.<br/>We did not use the spa or bbq so can't comment on those, but the area they are in is very nice indeed and would be great to enjoy on not such a cold weekend.<br/>The Barossa Farmer's Market on Saturday morning is highly recommended.  We also had wonderful meals at Vintners, Angaston and 1918 in Tanunda.<br/>I would wholeheartedly recommend Robyn's house for your stay in the Barossa.  <br/>Do note however, that there is no early check in available unless you pay for an extra day in advance."
12856765,305770648,2018-08-12,206391076,Morgan,"Robyn's place was beautifully appointed with lots of thoughtful touches. She went above and beyond as a host by meeting us on arrival to show us around  and by driving us to our dinner reservation at Hentley Farm.<br/>Particularly special features included the fireplace, spa, fresh local produce for breakfast and the chooks!"
12856765,309837391,2018-08-19,15740583,Andrew,Our stay was lovely. Robyn was really accommodating and the house was wonderfully cosy and perfect for what we were after. The house had everything it said it would and is a great location to Tanunda. 
12856765,312611564,2018-08-24,22907598,Rosalind,Robyn truely deserves her super host  status. Absolutely every thoughtful touch was evident in all she did. Great local cheese and fruit plus a beautiful bottle of wine to welcome us.
12856765,313707295,2018-08-26,3591001,Kristy,"A fantastic stay in Angaston. This house had everything. 4 comfortable rooms, multiple bathrooms, a great kitchen and dining table for big meals and it was walking distance to the shops and pub.<br/>The hot tub was HOT but very relaxing and the karaoke machine certainly got a workout. What a fantastic stay we had with a few other couples. Thank you."

12856765,329895257,2018-09-30,28892365,Paola,"Robyn & Andrew are wonderful hosts! They go above and beyond to offer fenomenal service. We can’t thank them enough for all the help with our wedding logistics and for helping us organising a lovely family picnic the day after the wedding. Most importantly, they made us feel at home. We had the best time at their place, it’s a beautiful house, sparkling clean and equiped with all the required items that you could possibly need. We travelled with my two months old niece and Robyn & Andrew made sure she had all that she needed. We will definitely stay there again!"
12856765,331155420,2018-10-01,119705637,Sharona,An amazing property. The second time now that I have stayed there. Robyn has thought of every little detail and supplies the house with great local produces. Very relaxing enjoying a wine in the spa or by the wooden fire. The photos really do not do the house justice. An amazing stay and Robyn is so helpful with suggestions. Will be booking again forsure.

12856765,347109886,2018-11-10,194251270,Karen,"Excellent location, lots to do nearby (Robyn gave us loads of options and ideas) or plenty of space to relax at the property (especially the spa). This was our return  girls trip for the second year ..very relaxing 😌 The side garden facing the creek was pure bliss...we all sat out there and became totally “zen” 👌🏻"
12856765,356033255,2018-12-06,70055260,Eleanor,"What an incredible place. Fantastic location for wine touring, excellent communication and wonderful fresh, local produce provided for delicious breakfasts (and some wine for the spa).

12856765,407655549,2019-02-02,110574999,Crystal,"This place is spectacular. There were little touches everywhere that were great, like shampoo, soap, makeup remover in the main bathroom. The spa was fantastic and it was a bit too warm to have a fire but the fire pit was all set up for us anyways. We had a great time using the karaoke machine and it was so nice to be able to cook up a breakfast with the fully stocked fridge provided. The beds were so comfortable as well. Robyn even pointed us in the right direction for restaurants etc and kept communication with us the entire time in case we needed something. We will be back to the Barossa and will definitely book this home again."
12856765,415964642,2019-02-24,52979642,Rachel,Our stay here was wonderful! The hospitality provided by Robyn & Andrew was wonderful. Made for a great weekend in the Barossa! <br/>The winery tour and grazing lunch was wonderful! They took us to a little ‘diamond in the rough’ winery which was very special! Would recommend!
12856765,422395817,2019-03-11,34604502,Jessica,"Thank you Robyn for providing such a gorgeous property. Extremely spacious, very relaxing surroundings and conveniently close to the town centre (without feeling like it). All four of us who stayed for our girls weekend found the beds to be comfortable and the linen immaculately clean. The food that was left for us was amazing, we made up a wonderful platter to enjoy on the back deck. All in all we had a fantastic time and definitely recommend!!!"

12856765,442588454,2019-04-24,248603934,Peter,Good base for exploring the barossa.  Clean and comfortable accomadation. Nice place with a private and spacious surrounding.  <br/><br/>Nice touches throughout the home from the host.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.
12856765,448206107,2019-05-05,210653089,Rebecca,Highly recommend this gorgeous house in its beautiful setting. Robyn was excellent to communicate with and the amenities were more than we expected. We thoroughly loved our stay and hope to be back one day soon. It's a credit to you Robyn.
12856765,451532031,2019-05-12,156505428,David,"This house was fabulous to stay in.  From the wood burning stove already stoked, and the hot spa, to the amazing breakfast supplies and wine and cheese platter.  Robyn is an amazing host, she met us at the house gave us a tour and explained how everything worked, and where to find things.  The house is in a great location with loads of wineries close by and the farmers markets.  Highly recommend it and would love to stay again!"
12856765,491887333,2019-07-21,268747718,Liam,"Truly the best weekend of my life, cannot recommend highly enough. Book here if you want to have an amazing time."
12856765,501658547,2019-08-04,13085786,Carol,"Robyn's house in the Barossa is absolutely fabulous for a group.  It's so close to the gorgeous township of Angaston (literally 5 min walk if that).  Robyn is one of the most generous hosts, leaving delicious provisions and treats, ample towels (including spa towels), outdoor blankets, umbrellas (we didn't need them) and anything else you can think of to make your stay first class.  There was plenty of heating to keep us warm and the beds were comfortable and beautifully made-up.  We had a ball with 3 generations on the karaoke machine, playing coits, even got the twister game out!  So much fun, thanks so much Robyn."
12856765,516775566,2019-08-25,4287547,Jenny,"Robyn was the perfect host!!! She organised us a beautiful tour through the Barossa, including wine tours, an amazing lunch and a gin tour!! Her welcome cheese platter was amazing, as was the ridiculously awesome local breakfast provisions.. the spa was great as was the fire - overall this was the best Airbnb I’ve ever been to, thank you!!!"

12856765,533647927,2019-09-22,115550773,Rebecca,"We were blown away by all the extra touches Robyn left for us.  So many treats - we’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb places but never had this before! The space was perfect for two families and Robyn provided a baby cot, high chair, changing mat and toys which were all in great condition.  Lovely comfy beds and bed linen, plenty of towels and thorough instructions on how everything works.   It’s a very homely log cabin - and perfectly warm for a cool spring weekend.  We loved it and would definitely recommend."

12856765,637046182,2020-07-12,157449041,Sofia,"A wonderful house in Angaston township. Beautiful garden, relaxing spa and loved the indoor fireplace. The extra touches of board games and amenities made the experience a fantastic Barossa getaway."

12856765,665911102,2020-09-20,349846243,Shannon,"This gem in Angaston is an amazing stay. The gardens and lawn are beautiful, the interior of the house is stunning, and the amenities such as the spa were incredible. <br/><br/>There were so many places locally to see and no shortage of things we could do. The town is beautiful and the local area around it hides some sweet spots in our stay like the Tanunda Bakery which had so many treats, we had to come back the next day.<br/><br/>After dark there was ample space to play board games with friends and spread out in the lounge and share a story or two. The spa was the icing on the cake and we used it both nights we stayed and even considered cheekily using it before we left.<br/><br/>Robyn was an outstanding host and went incredibly far to make us feel comfortable and to give us recommendations on great places to go while we were in Angaston.<br/><br/>If you're a group of people looking to get away for a weekend, you simply must stay here. It will be the highlight of your trip."

12856765,706039825,2020-11-01,96013732,Jenny,"While this property offered plenty of accommodation and amenities for our family, we were disappointed in the lack of attention paid to cleaning, in particular, the oven.  We found the decor tired and dingy rather than cosy and comfortable. <br/>Some of the items left in the “complimentary breakfast” were past their used by date.  It all added up to us feeling a bit “ripped off” as it wasn’t cheap accommodation.  We can’t believe the comments by previous occupants. We’re we really staying in the same place!"
12856765,707269273,2020-11-07,314602306,Jessica,"The host is great, nothing too much trouble. Provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay.

Lovely quirky place perfect for a weekend getaway."

Robyn was very helpful with local tips, and the house is an easy walk to the main street for some cafes. The lounge, dining and outdoor areas gives you ample space for a larger group (we had 3) or a family. Would love to come back again."

12856765,748136073,2021-04-12,10787275,Jason,What a great little getaway to Angaston! Loved the welcome platter and bottle of local Shiraz to start off our weekend away. Breakfast provisions were a fantastic to start our Saturday with a small feast.<br/><br/>Robyns home is a great location being so close to all the good wineries and restaurants not to mention just a short walk from the Main Street.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend and be more than happy to stay again.
12856765,750228315,2021-04-19,389286857,Con,"Robyn was an excellent host and the place itself was lovely. Additionally, Robyn was responsive to any queries we had :)"

12856765,758579843,2021-05-16,217646932,Andrew,"Robyn puts the BnB part back into the platform. Upon arriving, we were greeted with a bottle of wine, some local cheeses, breakfast provisions, a fully set combustion heater and warm jacuzzi. Robyn was a delight to deal with and her house is beautifully kept - clean, plenty of extra blankets and a kitchen that's stocked just like you would keep at home. All these little touches, and a great location within striking distance of the Barossa wineries, really made the place stand out amongst all the other AirBnBs I've been to.<br/><br/>Oh, if you happen to leave the front door open during the day expect a visit from the friendly brown hens."
12856765,760013730,2021-05-19,172789294,Ayan,"Loved our stay at Robyn's place in Angaston. We found the house to be very neat and well appointed, and close proximity to the town centre and vineyards pickup's and drop-offs. Additional touches like a breakfast hamper & complimentary wine went a long way in making us feel welcome. Would recommend!"
12856765,769471114,2021-06-13,91181155,Scott,We had an amazing stay at Angaston by the Winter Creek. 2 x couples enjoying a fantastic few days wine tasting in the Barossa.<br/>Communication with Robyn was perfect on the lead up to the trip and Robyn was able to organise for us to be driven around for a few days by John with Barossa beyond <br/>We all highly recommend Robyn and John . The house was amazing with so many little thoughtful touches like the welcome bottle of wine and cheeseboard. Breakfast basket was fantastic with local area products <br/>We had lots of laughs and a great relax by the fire and a soak in the spa at night after all day wine tasting <br/>5 stars doesn’t feel like enough for the fun we had ! We will definitely recommend Robyn and her amazing place to anybody our friends wanting an incredible time in the Barossa <br/>Thanks for having us !
12856765,401634226856515356,2021-07-07,62316497,Peta,"Robyn’s place was so much more spacious than we expected. It was like being in a Canadian ski lodge! There were so many  small, well considered touches that made it all feel very special. The place was well set up and we found it very easy to get settled in and enjoy the spa, fireplace, food and wine! Robyn provided a breakfast and we also purchased a bbq tray and picnic. These were sensational and I highly recommend them. There was  ample, high quality Barossa produce provided and we were more than satisfied! Robyns place was great for our family but it would also really suit larger families or groups of friends wanting to ‘lock in’. I can highly recommend this as a fantastic Barossa accommodation."
12856765,405998372593498242,2021-07-14,157551931,Melissa,"Such a lovely part of the Barossa to base yourself for a few days, to enjoy the wineries and great food.

12906285,136634345,2017-03-11,23493921,Coral,Rebekah and Ed's place was gorgeous. Simple yet stylish and as noted in the description based on the 1950's era. Very clean with all the things we required for our stay. Beck was easy to contact and her communication was very prompt. The main Street of Angaston was less than ten minutes walk and we enjoyed trying out some of the suggestions for dining including Roaring 40's pizza and Vintners Inn. Bed was brand new and very comfortable. Bathroom had just recently been renovated and was spotless. Would recommend this place for anyone visiting the Barossa.
12906285,138470739,2017-03-19,59665769,Greta,"This is a beautiful house in a quiet neighbourhood of the Barossa valley. The house is a good size for 2-4 guests with vintage furniture to complete the look. Rebekah was very helpful and quick to respond and was happy to leave us to our own devices. With a car it's very easy to get around the area but we recommend booking a tour if you want to indulge in the wine. We went for a fantastic dinner at Vintners Bar and Grill, just outside of Angaston. <br/>The house is a short walk into  town, where you will find a couple of pubs, cafes, a wine bar and food store. "
12906285,139525413,2017-03-25,116740540,Toni,"What a delightfully gorgeous 50's house - so full of charm. Rebekah has prepared the house perfectly for guests - the style, cleanliness, little extras, comfortable beds and beautifully renovated bathroom and laundry are a delight.  We highly recommend it for anyone travelling in the region - close to the main street of Angaston and a few short kilometres from Tununda. Rebekah's hospitality was second to none. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us."
12906285,143664608,2017-04-12,53870696,Jacqui,"Rebekah is a fabulous host. Quick to respond when you need her. House is quiet and cosy. Heaps of space inside with lots of cute little outdoor spaces in the garden. Large bedrooms with extremely comfy beds. Very practical and clean kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Lovely walk into town.

There was a delicious bottle of red left for us and some breakfast provisions.<br/>It's a short walk to the main street of Angaston with a good choice of restaurants and shops. Angaston is a pretty town and a great spot base a Barossa visit.
12906285,149541649,2017-05-04,35761139,Kay,It's like stepping back into the 50's brought back many childhood memories. Good value for money

Lots of space inside and out with a lovely big backyard full of beautiful roses. The house was in walking distance to Angaston town centre and a good area to stay to visit wineries in the region. Would definitely stay again!
12906285,208549845,2017-11-02,391966,Barbara,"Easy access to this property is so convenient and the yard is beautiful to sit and enjoy a glass of wine. Everything was immaculate. We made use of the washing machine and hung our clothes to dry, greatly appreciated after traveling for two weeks.  We spent three days at Rebekah’s and found it very central for exploring the Barossa Valley. Fantatic time, and if we are ever back this way would certainly stay here again"

12906285,229491875,2018-01-24,116740540,Toni,"Our stay in this retro cottage was perfect. It was well appointed with everything that we needed for a comfortable stay; especially the beds! The house is a short stroll from the main street of Angaston and in the heart of the wineries. The kitchen had everything we needed for self-catering but we took the opportunity to enjoyed dinner at Vintners one night as well. Handy wifi and laundry facilities (with powder!). There are plenty of cafes in walking distance with great coffee. <br/><br/>The attention to detail was incredible. From the authentic 1950’s décor, through to the modern luxuries (love that they give you TWO kinds of pillow!) this place is a joy to stay in. Did I also mention there’s wine provided for you, that’s made personally by the winemaker owner?? Can’t wait to come back for a longer holiday!”<br/><br/>Can't recommend enough.<br/> "

12906285,266962397,2018-05-21,706416,Kevin,"We stayed for 3 nights at Rebekah’s Airbnb and enjoyed our stay! It's great that she restored a classic/retro-style home and it was much more spacious than we anticipated. It had all the amenities one would hope for in an Airbnb, and she was kind enough to leave us some local welcome items (fresh bread, jam, milk, wine, etc.). These little touches improve the check-in experience, so it's great she adds that extra touch. The home is spacious, the location is central (close to what you'd want to explore in Barossa Valley), and Rebekah's communication was fantastic. Overall, a great experience and I'd recommend her place for anyone that needs a centrally-located home in the Barossa Valley.  Thanks!"
12906285,280700009,2018-06-24,28892365,Paola,Beautiful house and amazing hosts. The details and retro decor from the house are great. Thanks Rebekah for your assistance with our late check-in and for your hospitality. We would definitely stay again.

The Continental breakfast provisions and complimentary wine made life easy within a fully stocked kitchen with any pan or utensil you could possibly need. The linens were good quality, especially the quilt, and the bed is best for those who prefer a firm mattress. It is in a quiet neighbourhood close to all the delights of the Barossa. Netflix on the big TV was a treat to wind down after being out and about. Rebecca communicated clearly and quickly and checked in during our stay that we had everything we needed. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a stay at Rebecca’s place!"

12906285,418752055,2019-03-03,163725713,Murray,"This charming house on a quiet street in Angaston  provided the perfect accommodation for our weekend in the Barossa. <br/>Each room was well appointed within the theme of period 1950’s, but of course the modern conveniences there to remind you we are in the 21st century. <br/>The bathroom was large and modern and offered all the necessary amenities. Beds were comfy and pillows cloud-like. <br/>Although we didn’t make it out there for longer than a two-minute arrival sticky-beak, the backyard has massive potential if staying for longer - with BBQ area and beautiful garden beds full of life (the sunflowers were blooming when we were there 🌻)<br/>It is a short, pleasant downhill walk through the recreation grounds to the Main Street - so despite feeling like you’re on the outskirts, the property is really well situated to everything. <br/>Beck was supreme with her advice and communication - the ideal host! <br/>If we make it back to Angaston, we’d love to retro-it-up again."

12906285,462133717,2019-06-02,34181114,Kiaran,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  The house is an original 1950s place, with a beautiful rose garden at the front.  The interior is beautifully done out in very stylish original (refurbished) 1950s furniture, and there is a fantastic, spacious modern bathroom with an excellent shower.  The location is terrific - just a few minute walk to the very picturesque centre of the town, a few minutes drive to the fantastic Saturday morning Barossa Farmers Market, and with vineyards and wineries (including the wonderful and historic Yalumba site) just minutes away.  As numerous people have commented, the house is spotlessly clean and Beck is a superb and friendly host.  There was a bottle of local Jersey milk in the fridge, coffee and tea, and breakfast provisions provided, together with oils, sauces, herbs and spices for cooking.  The kitchen itself is very well equipped with high quality equipment - a cook's kitchen that we very much enjoyed spending time and preparing meals in.  And the beds were particularly comfortable.  Altogether a wonderful base from which to explore the Barossa Valley.  Highly recommended!"

I had difficulty finding the cottage( I drove past the clearly marked sign) and Henri was very prompt in calling when I asked for help.  On entering the property you quickly realise that you are dealing with a sensational host.  The little additions of biscuits, wine and the list goes on ( no spoilers here) will make your stay one of peacefulness and comfort.  The ambience and history of the cottage is first class, and please do not think stone cottage and dingy, this cottage is far from that.  Henri let us settle in and then offered to provide some local knowledge.  I would strong,y recommend you take him up on the offer because it will make your touring of the region that much better.  Thanks Henri, you are a great host and the cottage is fabulous.  We will see you again when we next travel to the Barossa or Clare valleys."

Henri was a fantastic host making us feel right at home and giving us lots of tips and suggestions for places to explore during our stay! From<br/>the moment we stepped in the door we felt very welcomed into a warm cozy cabin with great amenities and a lovely selection of food for breakfast (and more!). This is a wonderful place to stay for a little getaway to explore the Barossa Valley from! Our only regret is not staying longer!! Thanks again!😄
14080027,420565571827870285,2021-08-03,24177274,Scott,"Henri's cottage was a hidden gem.  From the moment we walked through the door, we felt like we were looked after and catered for.  Every detail was taken into consideration and you could really tell he'd put lots of thought into what what's really important.  Breakfast provisions were great, the cheese and wine on arrival was a bonus and all the facilities were comfortable.  We'll definitely be staying here again the next time were in the neighbourhood!! Thanks Henri!!"
14080027,439327886583288564,2021-08-28,34266959,Dale,"A beautifully secluded cottage nested between some lovely vineyards. Great location and not too far from many wineries or restaurants in the area. Henri made the check in super smooth and was very knowledgeable about the region. He had a lovely cheese platter with some local wine as well as breakfast options and snacks which accommodated for dietary requirements. The cottage itself is stunning with two toilets, a spa bath and an large open kitchen, a lounge room with television and Netflix, a sun room with games and bedroom with a king sized bed.A lovely stay highly recommend for a couple wanting to get away for a night or two!"

Henri gave me so many suggestions to help me plan our trip to the Barossa and we followed each recommendation for sightseeing, wine tasting and food experiences. <br/>When we arrived at the cottage after dark, the lights were on and the heater was pumping, giving us a warm welcome in more ways than one.  The cottage is very well appointed and comfortable, and the luxurious extra touches of food and drink meant we could have easily stayed put for our entire stay without needing to venture out.  We had wet, cold weather but the cottage and grounds would be even better in the summer months.<br/>Would definitely recommend."

The heritage farm-style accommodation was spacious and comfortable, in character with the family's working winery. jo was a gracious hostess who thoughtfully provided more than basic b&b essentials and all kinds of local knowledge that added to our Barossa experience. Highly recmmended"
14269050,130717988,2017-02-07,949596,Keith,"Wroxton Grange is a heritage Barossa homestead surrounded by sprawling hills with wonderful pockets of vineyards which we thoroughly enjoyed exploring. The accommodation was spacious and  comfortable for the four of us. <br/><br/>Jo was very accommodating who thoughtfully provided lots of local knowledge in the pamphlets/maps in the common areas. It was only a bit of a challenge for us when we wanted to cook up a feast as the kitchen was basically equipped. Nevertheless, we managed it with a big team effort and served up one of the meals of our trip!"
14269050,144938980,2017-04-16,23923651,Elly,What a beautiful spot. Jo made us feel right at home. The accomodation has the authentic cosy country feel.

Fine for couples who share one room but for friends who wanted separate rooms, I would have preferred this fee to be included from the beginning."

14377105,421177422,2019-03-08,79448304,Michelle,"A spotlessly clean house that is on a busy road just on the outskirts of Angaston. We were only given access to two bedrooms but I think there are three. Two very large and modern bathrooms, one with a bath, the other with a spa bath. An outside sitting area that feels a bit like sitting in a car park. <br/>We had some check in difficulties, it wasn’t clear that we had to go to a nearby winery to get the key. The host kindly let us check in early but then we ran late getting to our function because of time trying to contact the host and getting the key. <br/>No breakfast provisions, but a large kitchen."

The cottage was cosy, with a woodfire and cute furnishings making it feel like an authentic cottage experience. Some lovely pieces of furniture and items to appreciate. Bedroom upstairs had a comfy bed. Modern conveniences were available (full kitchen, wifi, tv, coffee pod machine, heater, etc). Included light breakfast provisions. Had everything we needed. Plenty of suggestions provided for places to visit in the area. Owners communicated quickly to all messages. Easy check in/out. Happy to refer this property and"

14697430,630939786,2020-06-21,118353375,Jillian,"It was a chilly day, but the heater was already on for us, so the house and the upstairs bedroom were toasty when we arrived. The chilly weather turned into a pretty serious storm, but Lemke Cottage is so well built and maintained that there were no cold draughts; the house didn't even creak in the wind! We built a fire in the combustion heater from the well-stocked kindling and woodpile, and weathered the storm with some port. So comfortable and well-appointed.<br/><br/>The kitchen had everything needed for breakfast. There's a gas stove and double oven if you want to cook more, though we took advantage of the local restaurants: Fermentasian (fantastic!) and Fino at Seppeltsfield (quite good). The sunken bathtub and shower had plenty of hot hot water, and the bathroom has a laundry and tumble dryer, so we could even dry and fluff our towels.<br/><br/>Moculta is a beautiful little hamlet, with kookaburras at dawn, rosellas and fairy wrens, so we enjoyed a lazy morning with the birdsong. Wish we could have stayed much longer."

14697430,648522832,2020-08-09,35853143,Diane,"John's place is a quiet retreat filled with wonderful items from the past. The location is great to visit anything in the Barossa Valley. Checkin was very easy. There is ducted heating, as well as a combustion heater which is in the formal dining area. The open fire place in the lounge area is not operational. There are plenty of other heaters if needed. The loft stays warmer than downstairs at night time. The bed was very comfy - ensured a great nights sleep. continental breakfast provided was generous, with  tea/hot chocolate and a coffee machine. Kitchen fit out excellent. The bath was great, the shower we could not get to give us a consistent good flow of warm water.  Very clean and tidy. Great communicaton."

The house was very clean and well equiped and our host was very responsive and communicative to my queries. It’s located in a small Barossa village but close to many of the main wineries and attractions. There is a small but interesting arts trail in the village of Moculta itself, not far from the cottage. We’ll worth a visit."

Extremely comfy bed, fantastic shower and a zero degrees plunge pool to get rid of the hangover :) <br/><br/>Couldn't recommend highly enough. <br/><br/>Vintner's is a 4 minute drive away for the farmer's market and a fantastic dinner, if you're over Barossa wines there's a great little authentic Italian place across the bridge from the White House and you can walk to the bike rental place which is directly opposite the bike trail. You can cycle to a number of wineries from there. <br/><br/>Top trip. Thanks again. <br/><br/>Matt and Bryony "

The linen reminded me of a Hospital linen in the 1930's. I just thought that if the bedding was up to scratch, it is worth the price. But i didn't get any sleep at all, my wife and i slept in separate beds because of the beds being way under what you would expect.!! Budget sleeping accommodation.!"

14969874,133996006,2017-02-25,26271951,Alex,A wonderful house. We had a group of 12 and there was so much room for all of us. The kitchen was perfect for cooking for the large group and we had a wonderful stay. Planning a trip back for the wintertime and would absolutely recommend

14969874,144919773,2017-04-16,5201757,Denise,The house is in a good location with easy walking access into Tanunda.<br/><br/>We picked it because it had plenty of rooms. We did not realise it also splits into separate rents if required. <br/>For our stay all doors were unlocked so the units flowed. <br/><br/>Old / antique décor - an interesting place to stay.<br/><br/>Would recommend booking the wine tour through the house too.
14969874,157399297,2017-06-03,3752053,Sonia,"Thank you Kym for a wonderful stay in the most beautiful house in Tanunda.  All the communication from the day I booked the house (and then accidently cancelled it) and then to the purchase of the food processor so we could make our pumpkin soup on the first night, was fantastic.  Response was always quick.  The house was beautiful, everything that we required was there and and in plentiful supply.  If we ever stay in the Barossa again we would have no hesitation in staying there again!.  Thank you so much again.  "
14969874,235780780,2018-02-17,71076417,Georgia,"Would highly, highly recommend this accommodation if staying in the Barossa. we stayed with a large group (13) for a 60th birthday and the setting could not have been more perfect!The house was beautiful and spacious and we were more than comfortable in the beautiful setting.. it was truely an amazing experience! <br/><br/>Walking distance to shops for a little bit of retail therapy or relaxing in a cute little cafe for a coffee.. but far enough out of the Main Street to have a lots of privacy! <br/><br/>We also made use of their bus transfer services to get to and from Hentley Farm restaurant and the bus drive Bob was an absolute delight! <br/><br/>10/10 for the accommodation<br/>and <br/>10/10 for the bus driver and service!!"

Outdoor dining looking over some vines was stunning in the warm evenings.  We were there to cycle the Barossa trail and the house was well positioned for us to achieve that.  Many thoughtful touches to the house including magazines and kids toys.  Highly recommended."

15579249,235203115,2018-02-15,24060304,Andrew,A really wonderful country location with great bird life. Quiet but so close to so many great wineries and restaurants. The house has been modernised to a high standard and was spotlessly clean. The welcome pack was very comprehensive and saved us doing any food shopping. An unexpected bonus was a visit from a family of kangaroos on our second evening.
15579249,236925599,2018-02-20,168822819,David,"Great place, well located, fantastic outdoor eating area and vineyard gave a truly Tuscan feel to the place. Many interesting and novel touches and more food provided than we could eat. Well done, nothing could be faulted and highly recommended."
15579249,243402215,2018-03-15,22293108,Kate,"We stayed at Casa Rosa for three nights. It was wonderful. The location is close to the town, but private, with a lovely outdoor dining area, over looking a vineyard. The bird life was magnificent and kangaroos visited the garden. We found the house exceptionally well equipped with beautiful high quality crockery and cooking equipment. There was a very generous welcome pack. The bedrooms were very comfortable with good quality linen, the bathrooms had great walk in showers and nice toiletries. We watched films together in the evening on the comfy sofa.  We would love to return for a longer stay. Highly recommended, you could not fail to enjoy this lovely house."

15579249,257629414,2018-04-27,179315206,Thomas,"Fabulous home in the Barossa. <br/><br/>We loved everything about this Airbnb stay. Thoughtful provisions were left for our arrival, including bread and spreads, milk, OJ, snacks, and sparkling wine ready to chill. The house is tastefully renovated and well maintained, and appointed to a high standard throughout. We loved the many “extras” available including toys for the kids, board games, the vinyl record collection and turntable and the open log fire. We slept well in the comfy beds.  <br/><br/>The house is located in a secluded location with its own small vineyard. Our only disappointment was that we couldn’t stay for longer!"
15579249,266966040,2018-05-21,28658675,Rebecca,Beautiful place to base yourself while you explore the Barossa

We greatly appreciated the trouble the hosts had gone to with a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us on the kithcen bench, if that wasnt enough there was also an ample carafe of port to enjoy whilst relaxing next to the fire place after a long day exploring the Barossa.  Fully ducted air con kept the place warm and cozy.  Wonderful rural position,secluded and peaceful yet close to shops at Lyndoch and easy access to wineries.  The outdoor area is amazing  youd swear you're  in Italy, surrounded by vineyards and great views over the Barossa  Plenty of stocks for brekkie and a little treat for those with a sweet tooth was much appreciated.  Maria is a wonderful host and has local managers to assist with anything you need, they were great to deal with and prompt with their replies.   Will definitely be back, thank you Maria we had an amazing stay."

15579249,350938514,2018-11-21,10292408,Stephen,"A very memorable first trip to the Barossa Valley!!<br/>We visited the Barossa Valley with another couple.  We were all first time travelers to the Barossa and did we ever luck out when we chose Maria's place.  It was the first time I've booked an Airbnb where the pictures and description did not do justice to what we experienced.  To create that perfect first impression, Maria had left us a beautiful ""welcome basket"".  The location was perfect.  We could drive to anywhere in the Barossa and Eden Valleys in 20-25 minutes or less.  We hiked in the mornings at nearby conservation areas, toured several top notch wineries in the afternoons, and BBQ'd and ate 'al fresco' on the terrace while watching the sunsets in the evenings.  Our wives had a very relaxing and enjoyable experience at a Spa in nearby Gawler as well.  One evening we even had some kangaroos visit us right in the backyard!  An enthusiastic two thumbs up from all four of us!"
15579249,354149633,2018-11-30,21713454,Amanda,"Casa Rossa was the perfect Barossa base for our party of 2 couples. <br/><br/>Stylish, comfortable and really well equipped with more bacon, eggs, juice etc in the breakfast pack than we could possibly eat in 4 days! <br/><br/>Lovely, quiet, cosy, elegant home that we would love to return to and 100% recommend to anyone looking for a perfect, central but private base for a wonderful Barossa experience."
15579249,422749857,2019-03-11,71604510,Susan,"Great house, very clean, lovely towels and linen, nice little touches like wine and breakfast provisions. You do need a car but shops and wineries all within a short drive. We loved the peace and quiet!"
15579249,486017635,2019-07-12,68211602,Sally,"We had a great week at this house, it’s in the perfect position for exploring the Barossa. It was quiet and private, plenty of space for six, very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed to self cater. Views across the vineyard towards to hills. The breakfast provisions were a lovely touch!"
15579249,488349883,2019-07-15,174854136,Georgina,"We had a fantastic time staying at Casa Rossa, loved the location and the house. So close to a lot of the wineries and beautiful scenery. Especially loved the morning and evening visits of the wallabies."

15579249,536494541,2019-09-26,121770944,Lynne,"Casa Rossa is a fantastic place.  It is situated in the heart of the Barossa so you can base yourself there and plan wonderful day trips to many of the wonderful little towns & vineyards throughout the Barossa Valley.  The house was spotlessly clean, the breakfast supplies plentiful, the beds extremely comfortable.  As it was still cool at night, we made a beautiful open fire which was the perfect way to relax with the wonderful wines we purchased.  Equally as nice on a warmer evening would be to sit outside taking in the vines & view, peace & quiet of the Casa Rossa surrounds.  I would totally recommend staying at Casa Rossa, it was a wonderful way to start off a few days R&R."

Lots of space for the kids to play outside as well as some toys and books inside, which were a big hit with our toddler.

Bedrooms are comfortable and kitchen is well-equipped. Nice vineyard a step from front door. Beautiful view of the valley. It’s a little bit noisy in the main bedroom while the air con was on. And The hot water tank is a bit small, had to wait for hot water overnight. Overall, it’s a great place to stay with couple of friends. Would go again."
15579249,658094113,2020-08-30,9358902,Bianca,"Casa Rossa is a perfect base for a Barossa short or long stay. It would make a great retreat for a couple, family or even group with it’s three bedrooms, two lounge areas, large dining table and delightful kitchen space. The records were an absolute treat. The entire space was modern and stylish but with beautiful character driven and historical touches that added a lovely sense of charm. We woke up to a kangaroo with a Joey in it’s pouch outside our bedroom window the first morning there and had lovely kangaroo visitors through the vines in the afternoons as well. The fire was a perfect space for a cosy evening after a brilliant day of vineyard touring and tasting. The breakfast provisions were substantial and the extra gift of wine and chocolate added such a thoughtful touch. It was a comforting enough to feel like a home away from home, but well thought out enough to feel like a wonderful holiday. We highly recommend this property and the swift and friendly communication of Maria. My daughter was thrilled to find the toys in her room and I was thrilled to find the coffee pods! Enjoy your stay in a lovely Lyndoch gem"

We were welcomed with a personalised card and a bottle of wine and some chocolates. It was a really nice touch and we enjoyed the delicious wine on our first night under the stars out in the alfresco dining area. The photos don't do it justice, the house is lovely, warm and homely, yet beautifully styled. The communication was excellent and Maria recommended some great restaurants, wineries and cafes for us to try. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, thank you again Maria."
15579249,766807628,2021-06-06,210370803,Jessica,"Great quiet and private location and a fantastic house, would definitely recommend for a family group looking to visit the Barossa Valley and stay close to the local wineries."
15579249,768218564,2021-06-08,26187,Christine,Great spot for a few days in the Barossa region. Incredibly spacious. Really well-stocked and excellent communication throughout our stay. Thanks for making it such a memorable trip!

15579249,403154329534352886,2021-07-10,26775986,John,"The post on Airbnb says it all. Actually Casa Rossa is even better! It is quite a luxurious home away from home with everything provided. If you don‘t like comfort, tranquility, lavish vineyard views then you should stay home.  Casa Rossa is handy to everything the Barossa Valley has to offer. I would return in a heartbeat."
15579249,407486453827194476,2021-07-16,219819907,John,"This place was a great stay for our family trip to the Barossa. Although it was only four of us, there was still lots of room to have another family and not feel crowded. The bathrooms are renovated and feel modern while the rest of the house has a classic feel to it. The kitchen had everything that we needed including utensils, paper towel, wraps etc. <br/>We will definitely stay here again on our next trip and bring another family."
15579249,410436287881620763,2021-07-20,326942275,Karen,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay.<br/><br/>The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The layout is great and the location is in a beautiful quiet area. <br/>Kitchen is well stocked with all the necessary utensils. Very comfortable.

Maria has gone above & beyond providing guests with complimentary breakfast & local wine. Couldn’t recommend it enough! Thank you for making our stay in the Barossa so memorable.
15579249,449556313428318950,2021-09-12,56165088,Adam,Great accomodation in an easy location for exploring the region. Appreciated all the extra touches like the complimentary breakfast and wine.
15579249,463967057487116575,2021-10-01,284757905,Ee Wah,"We had a great stay at Casa Rossa with our 5yo daughter. This modern farmhouse is spacious, clean, quiet, and beautifully furnished and decorated. We really loved the modern bathrooms (the shower products were lovely too) and the super comfy bed. The location was also great being close to cellar doors in the BV region. <br/><br/>Amazing outdoor setting that we didn’t get the chance to use due to the wet weather. But we thoroughly enjoyed the views of the private vineyard from the kitchen and even spotted a kangaroo hopping past. The fully equipped kitchen also comes with plenty of cooking pots and pans to whip a lovely family meal. <br/><br/>Special touches such as a complimentary bottle of wine + chocolates awaiting us, a cupboard full of fun board games to play, and the night lights along the long hallway and in the bathroom (very thoughtful especially for family with young children) were all appreciated. <br/><br/>Overall a wonderful experience. This place had everything you need for a comfortable stay."
15579249,465470733566631243,2021-10-04,87157922,Faraaz,Great experience staying at this beautiful house. Location was great but the the main highlight was the warmth the house provided.
15579249,485779141218961826,2021-11-01,144910377,Brenton,Perfect for 2 or a group. Great location being close to everything but a private spot. Why stay in a cramped little place when you can have this full house. Excellent clean kitchen and bathrooms. If you enjoy a bath then you will love the one here. It’s huge. Comfortable beds and everything you need is here.

The attention to detail was shown throughout the house, from the decor and little luxuries scattered around the house to the Netflix and apple tv access. <br/><br/>The kitchen is fully stocked, making the breakfast cook up a breeze. Oh, and the breakfast provisions, what a bounty! <br/><br/>With fantastic restaurants and cafes at our doorstep it was everything we could have asked for and more from a weekend in the Barossa. <br/><br/>We look forward to staying again, thanks from the Carraghers and the Nunans<br/>"

We felt like we were staying with old friends due to the warm correspondence beforehand and how we were greeted upon arrival. The space was clean, well lit, and quite private, with the ability to interact with the hosts in the shared space if you wish or keep to yourselves. We chose to enjoy a wine and a chat in the evening when we arrived back from our winery visit. This location is great value for a person or couple enjoying the Barossa and surrounds."

Anthea and Stefan were very welcoming on arrival and their fur family were just gorgeous. Anthea also shared some great walks to do around Angaston of which I went on one after I checked out and loved every minute. It is a quiet, clean and cozy place to stay."
15811271,269730269,2018-05-27,141236902,Christopher,"Anthea and Stefan are a couple of natural hosts who make you feel welcome and at ease very quickly. Our bed was very comfy and even had electric blankets for those chilly autumn nights. Even without that, the fire was going 24/7 to keep the whole house warm. We enjoyed the company of Merry (small dog). The 2 cats kept their distance, sadly for us. The house has Anthea's art work everywhere, which is just lovely and certainly adds a special touch to the house. Both of our hosts were accommodating, helpful and natural. We would highly recommend. The house is close enough for a stroll down town for a meal out, although the driveway is quite steep. Not for the faint hearted, but great exercise. Special little touches included a packet of local dried fruit blend and a bottle of red wine, should you choose to indulge. "

Pets and a few steps are within the home. The driveway is steep, but manageable. We found Anthea to be very warm, friendly and helpful. Check in was no problem. The bed was comfortable. There was a separate sitting room,  bedroom,  toilet and bathroom for guest use only. Didn't have to share anything, which we were very pleased about. Everything was very clean and neat. Anthea is an artist and has many pieces of her work on show. Very interesting.<br/>Thank you for a very   pleasant stay Anthea."

Anthea and Steffen were really friendly and really heart warming people. We also had dinner with them and it was a nice evening with really good talks. Also their dog and the two cats were cute. We can definitely recommend this place. Anthea also gave us good tipps and spots what to do in Barossa Valley. She organised for us our wine tasting tour. <br/><br/>All in all we had two wonderful nights in the Art Gallery Box with two wonderful people. Thanks Anthea and Steffen. :-) <br/>See you later !

Inside there are also a few steps, but very safe.<br/><br/>It's plain to see why Anthea and Stefan are Superhosts!"

15811271,751692194,2021-04-25,14739106,Stan,"As soon as you are greeted by Anthea and Stefan - you will automatically know you made a great decision to stay in their place and enjoy their warmth, hospitality and incredible house. Located a stone's throw away from Angaston centre and with sweeping mountain views, the house is littered with character and you'll be spoilt by special welcome touches, a cosy vibe and so much space! Very easy to reach the hundreds of wineries in the Barossa by car, bicycle or even foot (Yalumba). Anthea's artwork brings a unique character to the place and the pets are ever so fun. But the best part is Anthea and Stefan's company - they gave us so many great local tips, lifts to and from town and constantly made us laugh. A brilliant experience."

15811271,482879658137944934,2021-10-28,185275539,Nadia,"Firstly, Anthea and Stephan were the loveliest hosts. Such warm, fun loving people. I felt welcomed like family in their home. The space was spotlessly clean, very comfy bed with a lovely view of the hillside. Nice bathroom and private sitting room. At first I  was worried about not being able to cook for the 3 nights but there was everything needed to make coffee etc. or prepare some pickies to have with a glass of wine at the little table in the back garden. Also many good cafes and restaurants in town which was a 10 minute walk away. Great value for money.Thoroughly recommended!"

16519738,151733692,2017-05-14,83193385,Kathleen,"We really enjoyed our stay at Old Mill Cottage, the place itself is private and quiet and has a cosy feel. The cottage was well presented and clean, and the heating facilities are good as there is both a wall heater and a cast iron fire to light up for extra heat and ambience. Yvonne was helpful and quick to respond to all our needs. She was also able to provide us with a portacot which was a bonus. The kitchen doesn't have an oven, but has everything else required to cook family meals. The master bed is very comfy, with lovely soft bedding! All in all this is a very nice little hideaway, only 20 mins drive from tons of big name wineries. "
16519738,153365674,2017-05-21,69949008,Josh,The cottage was beautifully renovated with quirky themes. My partner needed more than 10 (Hidden by Airbnb) s to cover all the things she liked about the design. <br/>It was very comfortable and made for a lovely weekend away from Adelaide.

Kapunda is so close to everything, the garden is a gorgeous spot to sit in the sun and relax with a wine and enjoy a BBQ. It was still cool at nights so we sat by the wood fire inside and chatted. We had dinner one night at the Kapunda North Hotel which was also amazing. <br/>A coffee machine would be a great addition to the kitchen and some extra pillows would also be good."

With the way the Cottage was decorated, we felt like we stepped back in time, but the bathroom and kitchen renovation provided the comfort of the modern day. It was clean, comfortable and welcoming. It was such a pretty place to stay in, and the welcome of eggs, butter, bread, milk and juice was just so special after weeks of being on the road. The Old Mill Cottage was in a convenient location to check out Kapunda and the other towns in the Barossa Valley. We would highly recommend a stay here :)"
16519738,224945489,2018-01-04,69455935,Sarah,"Great place, tucked away on a quiet street, next to what looks like a reserve. We came on a very hot day and the air-con was super efficient. Loved the old stone walls & polished floorboards combined with a modern kitchen and bathroom. If you're after a large claw-footed bath to soak in and dream away the day, this is the place!"

16519738,336086643,2018-10-14,28903316,Palash,"Snuck into the Barossa for a friday wedding and booked this cottage without any hassle. The place was easy to find, easily accessible and very very clean inside. It had all that was needed (and more) including linen, towels, some breakfast supplies, toilet paper, wood for burning (if thats your thing), books, DVDs, a TV and a portacot. My wife was a huge fan of the supplied marmalade. The shower and bath is a cracker, and the hot water system is quick and excellent. <br/><br/>The location was outstanding with a reserve next door (including a large pond with plenty of ducks to see) and a nearby park 3 min walk away with a full size steam locomotive to play on - these were appreciated by my 2 year old daughter. Overall the place was great and I'd highly recommend booking it if you wanted to base yourself in Kapunda for a barossa trip. We ended eating at the North Kapunda Pub and FermentAsian which I highly recommend.<br/><br/>The place itself is great - and I have given it 5 stars. However if there was anything negative to note about the place, then its the following:<br/>- there is a tiny tiny amount of termite damage on one doorway - but this doesnt effect your stay<br/>- there are not many fly screens on the windows - so if you're keen to open up the windows and doors and let the breeze through you may need to be aware that bugs may join you inside.<br/><br/>Overall a lovely cottage"
16519738,341831103,2018-10-28,57997969,Mads,would highly recommend the Old Mill cottage. Such a cosy and clean place with great amenities and space. GREAT VALUE!

16519738,441476647,2019-04-22,14996554,Ali,"The cottage is a stylish cosy space on the fringe of Barossa valley with nice touches to it.<br/><br/>Pros: quite location, 20min drive to the pretty part of the valley and all the wineries. Nice living area with a vintage fireplace.<br/><br/>Cons: uncomfortable beds and mattresses. Second bedroom is very small with very little space when Occupied by an adult couple. Not very clean especially on the outdoor areas.<br/><br/>If the host addresses the above the cottage is worthwhile staying."

16519738,533564050330656436,2022-01-05,41688101,Lachlan,Beautiful home and fabulous hosts made our excursion to Kapunda really enjoyable.
16519738,537892164114242423,2022-01-11,67524843,Aaron,Amazing place for a getaway with everything you need. <br/>Yvonne and Glenn were very accommodating and easy to communicate with. <br/>Will definitely stay again!  :)
16519738,542234413066414178,2022-01-17,7633398,Heather,Lovely charming place to stay. <br/>Very comfortable.
16693931,128997716,2017-01-28,5631849,Cameron & Angie,"Go-go's was perfect for our stay in Eden Valley. It was much more spacious than we expected, and lovely evenings were spent in the cool breezes on the front verandah after long days exploring and wine tasting. It had everything we needed and the general store and pub were just down the road. It was super quiet, perfect for star gazing at night, and was wonderful to wake up to the sunrise and birds in the morning. Karine and Michael were great hosts and we'll definitely be back again. Thank you!"
16693931,136031269,2017-03-07,61327287,Ian,"Fantastic, comfortable and homely place to stay in Eden Valley, close to Barossa region. Clean, tidy and spacious. Lovely to sit on front verandah and listen to the birds. Especially loved how well equipped it was, even with supplies in the fridge and pantry, which was great as interstate travellers. Recommended"
16693931,136995201,2017-03-12,113435339,Susan,"My husband and our two friends just spent 4 nights in this fantastic accomodation. Everything was perfect from the spacious clean house to the host ""Karines' most knowledgable and local tips. Thank you. We can't wait to come back again as soon as possible. "
16693931,144896767,2017-04-16,121452039,Linna,"The property is set on a reasonably quiet road, located near some nice wineries a short (5 - 30 minute) drive away. The rooms are clean and spacious and looked better than they did in the photos. The kitchen was well equipped, including a stocked pantry with all the basics. The single bathroom and separate toilet worked out alright for four adults. The host was very friendly and helpful (and also environmentally conscious, which was a bonus).  Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and would consider staying there again. A few things that did not really bother us but may be worth noting for some guests are (i) there is no internet access and we had Optus network on our mobiles. The mobile connection dropped in and out a fair bit during our stay. Not sure if other networks would be better in the area. We had a GPS and did most of our research before the trip so it did not bother us; (ii) the house was very clean but perhaps given the season (autumn) we found a number of caterpillar-looking worms inside the house. We were not bothered but just had to watch where we put our steps when walking around the house; (iii) the TV signal was very weak on two of the three nights, with only one channel working. Again we were not bothered as we did not go to Eden Valley to watch TV but if you would like to stay in one night and put a show on for the kids then it would be tricky as there is no internet or DVD player. Overall it was a lovely stay at Go Go. Thank you Karine."
16693931,147456050,2017-04-26,116329651,Rob,A great retreat.  We loved the space for kids to play and a sense of being away from the business of life.
16693931,161424912,2017-06-18,3852768,Wilmie,"Go Go's was great, we had absolutely everything we needed and more. Excellent location - we were so happy we picked Eden Valley to stay and even happier with Go Go's. It was right in the middle of so many great wineries and other places to visit and really comfortable and well set up for relaxing after a busy day of sight seeing. "
16693931,162668004,2017-06-22,135424489,Amy,Thanks for having us! 
16693931,194425720,2017-09-17,143877236,Rebecca,A great place to stay. clean and tidy with room to move inside and out. The fresh baked bread waiting for us on arrival was a nice touch.
16693931,199425003,2017-10-01,142969854,Leslie,"Great Place, Great Stay, Great Hosts.  Brilliant place for Plenty of R & R.<br/>Enjoyed by all of us. Very Clean abode. The 2 dogs loved every minute of the wonderful gardens. Hosts supplied fire wood so we could enjoy an open fire under the stars brillant"
16693931,205308587,2017-10-22,54288921,James,"Set in the picturesque Eden Valley, Go's Go's is a great base to explore the Barossa Valley. The house is extremely spacious and has all the amenities, including a fully stocked pantry, for a no hassle stay. Host Karine is extremely helpful and prompt with responses to questions/requests. Overall, very good value."
16693931,209248895,2017-11-05,37354186,Justin,The house was excellent and very clean. Karine was very friendly and hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Karine!

16693931,212699346,2017-11-19,135338006,Ron,"Although we only spent two night's at Go Go's we were very impressed with the location and amenities, The rooms were spacious and tidy. The surrounds were well kept and it was pleasing to wake up to the sounds of country wildlife. The atmosphere was typical of Peace and Tranquility and very relaxing. The location  is within close reach of many wineries and the larger towns of the Barossa Valley. The hosts are a young couple who were very keen to please and ensure and ensure our stay was an enjoyable one. Thanks to Michael and Karine."
16693931,221241503,2017-12-26,158506485,Chris,"A fantastic place to stay. The house is clean and spacious with plenty of natural light through large windows. The rooms are large which is an added bonus when 2 toddlers are in tow and is well stocked from a pantry/amenities perspective. Set on a sizeable piece of land, there is plenty of space for outside play. The birdlife in the early morning and late of an evening was just wonderful to hear. While Eden Valley doesn't have a general store, this is easily countered by some forward planning. All in all, thoroughly recommended - a wonderful few days were spent here."
16693931,221817578,2017-12-27,103252146,Divya,Karine was an amazing host. The house was beautifully presented with a lovely backyard and all amenities also extremely clean. Could not ask for more.
16693931,224346517,2018-01-02,1123245,Dasha,"The place was great, very well equipped, we had everything we needed and more ( we were traveling with two young boys and grandma). It was clean, communication was great, we were welcomed with all basic groceries like bread, eggs and great wine :-) as we arrived late. Great location - lot to see around or in Adelaide and Glenelg village. Stay at least 3 nights to experience it all and visit some vineyards too :-)."
16693931,240486513,2018-03-04,138805060,Bernadette,"It was exactly what we were looking for. The friendly touch like a fresh loaf of bread, flowers and a well stocked pantry were certainly very much appreciated. The location was just perfect for us, a place surrounded by nature and beautiful birds."
16693931,249820425,2018-04-03,82615296,Terence,"Located in a very peaceful place with heaps of space inside and out, a very comfortable and spacious  house in which you feel at home. A very clean and tidy place with everything needed at hand."
16693931,257916041,2018-04-28,16224405,Mark,"We had a lovely couple of nights at Karine's place with my parents and our two kids. It was easy to check in and the communications prior with Karine were quick and accurate. <br/><br/>The place itself is located well, short drive to Fernfield Winery and easy reach to Henschke and the heart of the Barossa only a scenic drive of 15/20min away.<br/><br/>The house was clean and surprisingly well stocked pantry. We cooked at home for a night and whilst the place is of a certain age, everything works well including the heating and hot water in the shower.<br/><br/>Karine has done a great job putting some nice personal touches throughout the house and the real party piece is the garden, which is fantastic to just look out over and have the kids run around to chase the morning rabbits.<br/><br/>Thank you for letting us stay."
16693931,360001560,2018-12-19,40926607,Lester,This home is a very stylish and well-organised. Karine did a wonderful job as the host and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible. <br/>Thanks again Karine

Good location close to the wineries, and a very specious garden where the kids can enjoy themselves for ages. We liked it that everything we needed in the house was there. Super convenient. Karine was very quick and helpful in her communication."
16693931,440444169,2019-04-21,46223526,Petar,"We had a lovely stay at Karine’s house with our two young children. They played so much in the huge yard, and we even saw a rabbit crossing the garden on Easter morning! There was a swing outside and so many toys and books inside, so they were happily occupied all the time. The house is in a great location, close to beautiful Angaston and to so many lovely wineries. It had everything we needed and much more; Karine had kindly left some home made bread, Easter chocolate eggs for the kids, as well as a very well stocked pantry. We are so grateful for her hospitality and would love to be back to Eden valley for longer one day!"
16693931,491880716,2019-07-20,9675622,Sandrine,"Go go is a gorgeous spacious house with each room quite large, it was great for both our children with toys and games their age, the garden is delightfull, and we loved waking to the winery 1 km walking distance and did an awesome walk in the little conservation park 10 km away. Thank you for the delicious loaf of bread too!!"
16693931,582943273,2019-12-27,234599313,Jessica,"Go Go's was such an amazing place to stay!! Karine made sure we were alert, safe and looked after during the horrible fires in the Adelaide Hills even welcoming our family members who's properties had been affected by the fires to stay with us as they could not go home. Karine is an incredibly thoughtful person and we feel so lucky to have been able to stay in her property, everything you could imagine needing was already in the house from toys, extra bedding (which definitely came in handy), to a stocked pantry and even and emergency kit. If you ever get the chance to stay here I recommend you do it as soon as possible. You will not regret it!"
16693931,665552243,2020-09-18,9395883,Claire,"We stayed there for 3 nights with our 2 young children and we had the best time. There were fresh bread and eggs when we arrived and the house was spotless. Plenty of toys the kids would play with. The house had everything we needed and the garden had everything to entertain the kids. The region is so beautiful, lots of things to do and visit for the kids and adults! Great and relaxing stay. Thanks Karine for the hospitality, we will be back!"

16693931,718989543,2020-12-28,48841864,Richard,It was a 'home away from home'. All the things you expect to find at home are there. Plenty of space inside and out. Also thrilled to find a loaf of freshly baked break from Karine on arrival. That was delicious and so thoughtful.
16693931,721797212,2021-01-03,31865658,Sara,We had such a lovely stay- the house was very clean and Karine left us a loaf of homemade bread 😊

16693931,745853320,2021-04-05,158319528,Craig,"The house is perfect for a family, with lots of space and everything you need to self cater your holiday. The location is great for going anywhere in the Barossa."
16693931,759421425,2021-05-17,30082373,Karina,"Our family of 5 had a wonderful stay at Karine's place. It was perfect for our visit to the Barossa Valley, and had everything we needed.

We can't wait to go back!"
16693931,763929570,2021-05-29,273266668,Sarah,"We loved the large property and tidy, spacious house. It is well equiped with everything you could need. You can sit on the porch and enjoy the serenity, while being greeting by the neighbouring sheep. Twas a lovely stay."

16693931,408220859115986447,2021-07-17,10562004,Shaun,"Beautiful property with plenty of space to roam and soak up some peaceful country ambience.<br/>The house is amazingly well equipped with everything you could ever need in the kitchen, pantry, and the kids toy room is so well stocked. Plenty of toys to keep our little ones entertained- from 1 year old up to 8 years old. Loads of different board games too.<br/>There is no shop in the town of Eden Valley, we got all our supplies from Foodland in Angaston, which is about a 15 min drive away. <br/>Beds have electric blankets which was so great for our winter stay. And the rooms are really big so plenty of space to play and spread your suitcases out too! <br/><br/>It was a perfect home away from home and Karine was super friendly in all our communications. Self check in but she  called by in the evening to see if we had any questions and to ensure we had everything we needed. <br/><br/>Definitely recommend for an all in one family getaway!"
16693931,429184121122046059,2021-08-14,24313403,Sio,"What a wonderful place to stay! A stunning property, with everything to make our stay comfortable. The local sour dough, fresh eggs and milk a lovely thoughtful bonus! The friendly sheep next door a highlight for the kids and the electric blankets magical for the cool nights! We can’t wait to return! Eden Valley is enchanting with a pub meal a short stroll away! Thank you so much!"

It was definitely a very relaxing and much needed getaway for our family of three, after having to cancel two interstate holidays! Our 2.5yr old son loved the toys and books, the garden outside, the sheep, basically everything... and if he’s happy, so are we! Karine came to even say hello and checked if we got any questions at all, there was a fresh loaf of bread upon our arrival and both Karine and Michael were easily reachable at all times during our stay. Overall, everything was great :) We hope to be back."

16795559,135395249,2017-03-04,113341642,Leah,"The cottage at Buckbury End farm is situated on a picturesque property. Beautiful country breezes, an outlook of peppercorn trees and gums and a gorgeously appointed cottage await. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing, romantic escape then Buckbury end is your destination. Every detail has been attended from fresh cut flowers to the gourmet farm breakfast products and natural Australian bath products. We can't recommend this place enough!"
16795559,136294511,2017-03-09,52288543,Margaret,"John is a kind, caring host who has created a beautiful escape."
16795559,136460331,2017-03-10,52288543,Margaret,"John is a kind, considerate and hard working host. He has created a beautiful place to escape."
16795559,136634015,2017-03-11,450379,Tim,Great secluded location which offers all the amenities of Tanunda (10 min drive away). The cottage has everything you need and the inclusion of a surprise breakfast in the fridge was unexpected but totally appreciated. Would stay here again and again!
16795559,137017904,2017-03-12,5395250,Corinna,John is a lovely host! We really enjoyed the mini tour around his property and wandering down the path to the creek. The cottage is lovely - has everything you need and really sets the scene for some excellent R&R! A perfect getaway for those wanting to be surrounded by nature and not too far from wineries and attractions! 
16795559,137859785,2017-03-17,11668133,Julie,"John's place had absolutely everything you could want. We even saw a kangaroo close by while we had our breakfast - a must for overseas visitors. The attention to detail in the cottage was well appreciated, as was the peace and quiet. A special place. Highly recommended."
16795559,138075399,2017-03-18,115721708,Carmel,"Located on a farm, but still very handy to all the scenic and tourist attractions of the Barossa. A lot of love and care has gone into restoring an authentic slice of Barossa architecture. Gives you the opportunity to experience a stone cottage but with all the mod-cons. Fabulous!"
16795559,138851878,2017-03-21,28088758,Julie,"Wow if you want country - you have it here!  Location just a little out of town but very easy to find when you follow the instructions given by John.  Ample food for breakfast, bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, bread, yogurt, fruit, juice and all the condiments necessary.  The very new and modern kitchen is equipped with all the mod cons.  Top quality cookware, crockery etc...  This farm cottage has been decked out with exceptional detail...lovely linen too.<br/><br/>We arrived and I was reading when husband went out to explore, next thing I recive a phone call from my husband to come and join him. I find him with John (our Host) and there they were beers in hand having a right old talk, I was then handed a drink myself.  Now that is what I call a host and country hospitality.  John is in the process of renovating the main farmhouse - an enormous job - we look forward to coming back in 5 years ? 10 perhaps? :) Great stay...thank you"
16795559,139329673,2017-03-24,7727030,Alison,"John was the perfect host, very prompt in responding and giving directions. The cottage is comfy and lots of mod cons. A great setting for close access to the Barossa Valley."

16795559,143647110,2017-04-12,101860244,Joanne,"We had a wonderful stay at Buckbury end farm - quiet, lovely views and walks. John provided lots of information ahead of time, the fridge was well stocked with eggs, bacon, sausages, etc for breakfast, and John's dad dropped by after a couple of days to see if there was anything we needed.  Wonderful place to get away from it all."
16795559,144133763,2017-04-14,43734378,Michael,"Book this place now. It has everything you could want for an escape to the Barossa. Quiet, clean, beautiful property, and extra little touches that make it just magic. Thanks John."

16795559,146826907,2017-04-23,14556643,Rebecca,"This gorgeous little cottage is the epitome of the beautiful scenery and heritage of Barossa. Newly renovated and attention to detail with comforts like a fridge of essentials as well as breakfast essentials, bathroom essentials and the lovely crisp and clean bedding. So close to town and all the wineries you can imagine and in a quiet, country location this is the perfect getaway accommodation! We will absolutely stay here again. John was organised and communicated quickly. He was very generous and gracious and we felt totally at ease. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Barossa. We loved our stay thank you John!"

16795559,148474224,2017-04-30,22142584,Sarah,"John's cottage is a cosy, authentic place to stay in Barossa Valley. My husband and I stayed there for 3 days for our anniversary and we would definitely stay there again. The bed is very comfortable, the shower is nice, the kitchen has everything you could need. There is a TV, however there is no Wi-Fi. John has left little treats everywhere - breakfast, chocolates, magazines, toiletries, BBQ, etc. The location is great - close to all the wineries but far enough for peace and quiet. There's even a stream you can walk to on the property."
16795559,150049187,2017-05-07,122991474,Kath,John is a great host and the cottage provides every comfort needed while on a trip.  Attention to detail in providing a well equipped kitchen and bathroom was really appreciated - and the quality of bath/bed linen was a wonderful bonus.  Thanks for providing such a gorgeous cottage getaway.  A close drive to Tanunda (15-20 mins) with plenty of wineries and a scenic countryside drive - and so quiet at night.  Thanks John.  It was wonderful!
16795559,150726771,2017-05-09,120266473,Svenja,"This place is a recommendation for everyone who enjoys staying in a romantic and cozy cottage in a secluded area with a lovely country side. Take a walk to the nearby river, enjoy the peacefulness of the area or drive to Tanunda in 15-20min. It has all the nice touches and essentials for a wonderful stay. Everything is spotlessly clean. Thanks again John. You have done a great job."
16795559,151453347,2017-05-12,37111252,Greg,"This place is fantastic. Take it from an Adelaide local... If you're travelling in the Barossa Valley, this is the spot where you want to be staying. Only a short drive away from wherever your Barossa adventures happen to take you. Gorgeous setting, great host. Next time we'll look to stay longer and have a beer with you!"
16795559,151683573,2017-05-14,59444979,Catherine & Naomi,"What a gem!<br/>This cottage was so peaceful, tranquil and beautifully located. Set in the rolling Barossa Hills in a tucked away part of the world, we felt miles from civilisation. <br/>The cottage was tastefully renovated and decorated with quality linen and kitchen supplies. We had everything we needed. <br/>Thanks John, what a fantastic job you've done! See you again! "
16795559,153851291,2017-05-22,632928,Chuck,"This place is extremely close to everything in the Barossa, but very secluded. Charming home, very private, and more views and birds than we ever expected. We chose to get back before sunset each evening so we could just hang out around the property. Highly recommended, and we will return when we get back to this great wine area."
16795559,154326854,2017-05-24,128209074,Milly,"Absolutely beautiful little cottage, was exactly what we were after for a relaxing little getaway by the fire"

The cottage is beautifully restored, very cosy and with top quality soft furnishings and so many little extras that were greatly appreciated. Highly, highly recommended."

It's located in close proximity to many wonderful wineries. John recommended Pindarie for lunch and the views and was one of<br/>The best places we visited and would<br/>Highly recommend it. Do call for<br/>Reservations if it's a long weekend or you want to eat at a certain time. Thanks again soo much John!
16795559,167787973,2017-07-08,137380629,Margaret,Amazing cottage! John was very helpful. It was fullly equiped with everthing we needed. The small personal touches like flowers and chocolate made it even better. Very cozy and close to everything you need it the barossa.

A lovely, peaceful getaway.  "

Warm and cozy on the coldest day, comfortable armchairs and the bed is hard to leave being one of the best away from home mattresses I have ever slept on.  Highly recommend this cottage and we will be back ourselves!"
16795559,189497387,2017-09-02,56558193,Marie-Therese,"A lovely, cosy & refreshing place. Old stone cottage, juxtaposed with very new fit outs that make it comfortable, interesting and relaxing.

16795559,206324471,2017-10-25,124474041,Al,Wow!  John has created a little slice of heaven with his restored cottage.  Very tastfully done utilising the old stone cottage highlights with modern very clean facilities.  Everything for a relaxing quiet getaway.  Access to the creek and picnic spot is exceptional in the afternoon for a glass of wine and a beer in glorious country solitude.  The cottage is close to all the Barossa Valley attractions and takes no time at all to get to the wineries and local shops.  We cant recommend John's cottage highly enough!!  Well done.

16795559,212432722,2017-11-17,116640427,Abigail,"A well appointed cute little cottage, on a super quiet and peaceful block of land. John's done a wonderful job of setting up this little getaway to feel like a home away from home. It's gorgeous on a nice day, and super cosy and comfy in bad weather. We were totally left to enjoy the space in peace, and appreciated the generous fridge contents and personal touches of the property. John was a great communicator and kept us apprised of a road closure that was to occur during our stay meaning we could plan around it and make the most of our time. We will be recommending it to others. Thanks again!"
16795559,212653677,2017-11-18,106069151,Michael,Perfect accommodation for attending a function in south Barossa. Rustic and quaint but also everything we needed. Little details taken care of... and we love the breakfast supplies!
16795559,214403982,2017-11-25,10963073,Kate,John's farmer's cottage is a pleasant and comfortable place to stay. We stayed after attending a wedding in the Barossa. It was located in an convenient location (although accessed via dirt roads) and was a good choice for us for an overnight stay.
16795559,216006653,2017-12-02,5745312,Jean,"My husband and I had a wonderfully peaceful stay at John's wee cottage. Everything was as we pictured and the amenities all of superior standard.

16795559,225910829,2018-01-07,25819808,Kristy,"John’s place is just beautiful! A gorgeous little cottage with all of the modern amenities you could want. Breakfast supplies were delicious and plentiful. The place was absolutely spotless, and there were even fresh flowers on the table!<br/>The property itself was so lovely and peaceful. My husband and I enjoyed a walk down to the creek and wildlife spotting. We would have loved to go down there for a picnic with the provided bag, but it was 42 degrees so we stayed in! John’s communication was super efficient too. He was always so fast to respond to my questions, and was able to facilitate us arriving early, with the air conditioning on waiting for us!<br/>The property feels very remote, but is actually only 15-20 minutes from major Barossa towns. We were able to have a winery tour pick us up from there and also a taxi driver drop us off with no problems at all. <br/>An amazing stay overall! Thanks so much John!"

We really appreciated the thoughtful touches - the air conditioning switched on ahead of our arrival, the brekkie provisions and the picnic basket. It was such a peaceful spot but still close to everything. Highly recommended!"

16795559,260148545,2018-05-03,70447563,Bill,Interesting location for the cottage surrounded by relics of a bygone era yet indoors a delightful contrast between the old world in the part slate floor and old fireplace with high quality modern appliances and fittings which include an induction hot plate for cooking and a Bose speaker unit for streaming on mobile phones. Everything provided for a great break in a secluded setting. Overall a great credit to Joh
16795559,260737968,2018-05-05,47350468,Michael,Thank you John - such a spot and such a host. We felt incredibly welcome and couldn’t think of a better place to unwind for a few days.
16795559,261760131,2018-05-07,125422956,Sue,John's cottage is warm and welcoming. Craig and I felt safe and relaxed there. We enjoyed walking down to the river and having a chat with the sheep.

Appreciate the breakfast provisions eggs, bread, milk, cereals provided. Location is secluded & quiet.<br/>Don’t miss boutique wineries Charles Melton & Pindarie as well as Barossa weekend market! As others mentioned a bit of dirt road leading to the cottage but it’s not an issue for us & the drive was easy."
16795559,269145796,2018-05-27,12378541,Laura,"Johns property did not disappoint! The cottage was very clean with high quality amenities. Check in was super easy, especially as we arrived late at night. John was very helpful in suggesting the best ways to access the property - local insight is best! Small touches like the included picnic basket, breakfast items and coffee were a nice touch. It was lovely waking up to cows and sheep on the surrounding farm. This property was great value for money and I would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting the Barossa region!"
16795559,284699573,2018-07-02,3520998,Carla & Jenna,"My partner and I stayed at the cottage to celebrate our anniversary. We loved the place, it was so clean, had loads of original features but also felt luxury. John is a top host and went out of his way to accommodate us! We loved the location as it felt remote, but was only an hour to Adelaide and a couple of minutes from some great Barossa winery’s. I’d recommend booking a winery tour through Getaway tours as you can be collected from the gate. We’ll be back and I’d highly recommend the cottage to others looking for an awesome weekend away."

It was a pleasure staying in this traditional cottage, enjoying the old world charm, whilst having all the modern comforts of electric blankets, heaters and dishwashers! You can decide if you want to have a toasty wood fire or stick to more modern heating options. John really provides a welcoming experience, fresh flowers, ethical products, treats and best of all, a very peaceful and private experience, thank you! "
16795559,295112019,2018-07-23,40236354,Harriet,Cannot recommend this wonderful cottage enough. John was so accommodating with our stay and the thoughtful details made our stay very comfortable and memorable.

16795559,315062394,2018-08-28,47429019,Jesse,Really enjoyed our stay. Was a little disappointed to have to provide our own firewood for the fireplace (and only found this out on the morning of check in) but aside from that we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend.
16795559,316246237,2018-08-31,94699866,Megan,I really do not want to do this because I believe it is  a wonderful secret of the Barossa and I do not want to share...but to be fare this is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had...and I have used Airbnb quite a lot in the past few years. <br/>The cottage is set back from Johns property and is very private with a lovely out look onto a garden and the farm its self. The attention to special details is amazing and the cottage has absolutely every thing you could possibly need to make your stay completely self sufficient. It is close to many wineries and Tanunda. <br/>I have no hesitation in recommending this property for couples who need a getaway from their busy lives. <br/>Thanks so much John for making us feel very welcome
16795559,317217494,2018-09-02,113784576,Amber,Our stay at Johns was a very enjoyable one. Cosy little cottage about 15 minutes out from Tanunda on a beautiful farm. One of the best airbnbs I have stayed in. Will be recommending to friends and family!
16795559,320433763,2018-09-09,203852974,Gillian,Such a great little cottage with everything you need for a comfortable weekend away. We loved it!
16795559,324400382,2018-09-17,189425802,George,A great studio cottage for a couple looking for a quiet time off the beaten track and away from the hustle and bustle. Most enjoyable. Johns little extras are certain to please.
16795559,326730306,2018-09-23,33166631,Marnie,Perfect little getaway cottage on a beautiful farm! Johns hospitality was excellent too! We really enjoyed our stay and will defiantly be back.

16795559,331205664,2018-10-02,100323658,Laraine,"The farm cottage at Buckberry End Farm is delightful, very comfortable and well set up.<br/>It's situated in beautiful and peaceful countryside. We enjoyed walking down to the river each afternoon.<br/>This is a great venue to stay and explore all that the Barossa Valley has to offer.<br/>We'll be recommending this venue to our friends."
16795559,333141798,2018-10-07,156015689,Kathryn,"We stayed at this beautiful little cottage for our anniversary weekend and it was perfect. John was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and even let us have a late check out as there was no one staying immediately after us. It was a great location, very quiet and secluded but still easy to get where we needed to go around the Barossa. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a couple of nights away!"
16795559,338937818,2018-10-20,102171559,Barbara,"This dear little cottage stole our hearts.  The pictures don't do it justice.  Rustic with all the mod cons, very comfy,  very clean  and the  most generous provisions  EVER!!  The flowers  were lovely and the  attention to detail was amazing,  everything was  thought of. The views outside are spectacular especially in the mornings and when the sun is setting. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and wandering down to the creek for  drinks and picnics. We loved seeing the animals and sharing our apples with the horse and pony. The roads around the property and in the area have gorgeous vineyards and olive groves to feast your eyes on as well.   John is very friendly and  available if you need anything but also very discreet, leaving you to  your privacy. Tips: Chateau Barossa's garden was really nice and their leek and chicken pie with mash was delish! Seven hills winery and tour in Clare Valley is really worth a visit on a sunny day as is the Lavender farm. The drive there from Lydoch is gorgeous and going to Parson's lookout on Trial rd as you turn right from the Lavender farm, not to be missed. Mintaro is very cute and charming  (and small) if you like old English type villages.  The ""Co Op: shop is amazing. We were drooling over all the cheese!

We stayed here with our five month old daughter for three nights and loved every minute. The cottage is lovely and warm, quiet and peaceful. It is kitted out really well with everything you need. It was spotlessly clean. We appreciated greatly that the fridge had been stocked with breakfast and loved that there was a dishwasher, who wants to wash the dishes on holiday!? The farm is lovely will lots of opportunities for walks and wildlife spotting. Thanks John for an excellent stay."

The cottage is beautifully kitted out and you are lacking for nothing. A lovely breakfast awaits you in the fridge. We arrived on a 40 degree day and John had kindly turned on the air conditioning which was very effective. The property leads down to the river an there is even a picnic set for you to use. Highly recommended."
16795559,420840409,2019-03-08,5396190,Alex,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Buckberry Farm. The beautiful stone cottage is perfect for some peace and quiet after a long day exploring the Barossa Valley. We just wish we had more time to stay and relax around the property itself. Unfortunately we didn't find time to head down to the river and have a picnic. Overall the place was very homely, clean, comfortable and in close proximity to all the best cellar doors. The breakfast ingredients supplied in the fridge were especially a really nice touch! Would definitely look to stay here again if we return to the Barossa."
16795559,423074853,2019-03-13,207896022,Alexandra,"This is the perfect private retreat , away from traffic, noise....and people.

This was a wonderful escape, it was peaceful taking a picnic down to the river and seeing the cows come in to the shed in the evening while having a barbeque, this is the place to be for a lot of serenity!! + Super fast communication and close to vineyards if that's what you are after, thank you John!"
16795559,423692468,2019-03-15,41936579,Susan,"We really enjoyed our stay at Buckbury End Farm. The cottage has the perfect combination of rustic charm and modern amenities.

The farm was fantastic; felt remote but was only a 25 min to the town centre and wonderful wineries. We had a great time!"
16795559,438511904,2019-04-17,49671366,Jenni,What a way to complete your Barossa experience. It was so beautiful waking up surrounded by farm life and finishing the day with a picnic on the banks of the river. John went out of his way to make our sister holiday getaway extra special by including a happy birthday sign. We couldn’t recommend this little cottage more. Thank you

Loved all the extra touches like fresh flowering orchids on the dining table, sumptuous Sheridan towels and all the makings for a delicious breakfast including smoked bacon and farm fresh eggs.  John and Jess have done a great job of combining a mix of the historic building with all the items to make you feel like you never left your home.  Would definitely stay there again."

16795559,451510289,2019-05-12,110357627,Charles,"Buckbury End Farm Cottage is a rare gem! Nestling in a working farm, with your own path down to a peaceful picturesque river, you have your very own haven and refuge from which to explore this iconic wine and food Mecca. The cottage is recently renovated to a very high standard, charming classic luxury! All the facilities are perfect and spotless, the hospitality perfect and the breakfast to die for! We will be back and would not consider staying any where else. Private luxury 7 minutes from the first Cellar door - perfection."

16795559,471088646,2019-06-17,46836732,Diana,"Great little hideaway for two in the Barossa Valley. Well located to explore the Valley, tastefully decorated and comfortable. Highly recommend."
16795559,474192389,2019-06-23,19096426,Mark,"As described - a cosy little cottage in the country.  The cottage was warm even though it was very cold outside with the temperature dropping to 1c.  The Air Con was enough to keep us warm, but the open fire added ambience, although you have to bring your own wood.  It was a nice base for a short break from the city and a day out on the bicycles.  The Barossa cycle trail isn’t far away and the Rosedale Scenic Road is worth a detour.  We didn’t need to contact the hosts during our weekend stay, even though they were just next door, because everything we needed was provided and there is a combination key box to let yourself in."
16795559,479438962,2019-07-01,95372271,Amy,An amazing space in a great area. Great ambiance with a fireplace and a well equipped kitchen. Great communication from hosts. A wonderful stay! :)

Our daughter LOVED the animals (esp the cow), and we slept better then we have since she was born. Amazing location (minutes away from wineries), and we really appreciated the thoughtful touches (fresh eggs, bread, milk and breakfast food). Thanks again! We will definitely stay again when in the area."

16795559,530590584,2019-09-16,60003136,Veronika,"John and Jess's cottage is absolutely lovely with a charming country feel, yet is fully equipped with all of your necessities. Its location is absolutely superb to many surrounding wineries and little towns for restaurants, shopping, etc. The cottage is situated in the back of the main house, but allows for full privacy and zen. We enjoyed the gorgeous scenery, the farm atmosphere experience, and ending our nights by the cozy fireplace. It was an absolute great getaway, allowing for full Barossa exploration and ultimate relaxation. We would absolutely be delighted to stay there again."

I took my girlfriend for her birthday and they were kind enough to add a sweet birthday message on the bed for our arrival, and in the entertainment area on the property. The entertainment area was especially beautiful, a perfect place for a BBQ dinner under the stars, sunset, or by the fire. We absolutely loved the property and would recommend it in a heartbeat, John and Jess's hosting skills to add thoughtful touches, provide breakfast, and make sure we felt at home were great extras to make the stay extremely enjoyable."
16795559,551097684,2019-10-19,52067134,Alexandra,"This AirBnB is truly amazing! We absolutely loved our stay.  If you like the country and peace and quiet, this is the place for you.

It's remote enough to feel private and secluded, but close enough to drive everywhere you want to go! There is a lovely walk down the back of the property with a beautiful tree swing by the water. The kitchen is equipped to cook delicious meals, or to have a picnic by the river. All the amenities are brilliant and big enough for two people comfortably. Brilliant!"

16795559,571240837,2019-11-30,23793482,Benjamin,What an amazing place to stay! We visited the Barossa to explore over the weekend. John and Jess’s place was the perfect location to explore the Barossa and also relax and enjoy the beautiful views from the patio. The cottage itself is very well appointed and the perfect size for a weekend getaway for 2.

Very highly recommended!

16795559,576615869,2019-12-14,239242080,Mary,We spent two nights at the cottage and were delighted with our stay. John was swift at replying and sent detailed info as to how to reach the farm. We loved the country feel of being on a working farm with accommodation reflecting its rural location but with modern amenities. A great spot to use as a base for visiting the many local wineries. If we lived closer we would be regular visitors!
16795559,584308749,2019-12-29,61881449,Enrique & Jackie,"The Farm cottage was conveniently located close to several wineries in the Barossa region. <br/><br/>The hosts have thought of everything. The small details made for such a cosy and comfortable stay. The eggs, bacon, bread and milk provided was perfect for breakfast. <br/><br/>Being located in a farm it is natural that we had several spiders visiting us. Additionally, we may have had more than the usual amount of visitors, due to the heat wave. It made it a bit scary for my partner who is petrified of spiders, even though she grow up in the country. We survived though and the hosts provided bug spray. <br/><br/>Overall, it is great value for money compared to other offering in the region."

It is a little bit further out, however was easy enough for us to find, and our Barossa guide was still more than happy to pick us up from here. As for the space, it was cosy and stylish, and the reverse cycle airconditioning was wonderful on the cool nights we had. It was a great bonus to be able to wander down to the river and experience the bleeting sheep and have a tiny taste of farm living. The breakfast provisions were also most appreciated (and delicious!) Would recommend."

16795559,770339910,2021-06-14,44775265,Caoimhe,"Location was great - isolated and peaceful - great to get away from city life. Fire and cottage was cosy but some things could be better such as the batteries in the candles could work, or the fact there was only one robe to share. Communication was absolutely awful, reached out to owners and asked them to call me multiple times due to an incident on the farm with an injured farm animal and no one could help. We had to find a neighbour to help. Even now I haven’t had a reply from them. I understand they were away for the long weekend and had no wifi, but hosts should be contactable. <br/>Lastly, there were mouse droppings when we arrived everywhere. We saw the mouse every night running around on the floor, even under our bed, he was even in the toaster at one point. We understand it’s a working farm and that’s hard to manage, but the droppings were everywhere inside and we couldn’t sleep both nights due to the mouse scurrying in the cottage. We went out to buy mouse traps too. <br/>It’s a shame as the reviews were so great and the location and cottage was beautiful- but we personally didn’t have a brilliant time and won’t be back."
16795559,398844490122567763,2021-07-04,261525810,Gabby,"We had such a lovely time! Definitely a super host. Cooked breakfast provisions. Kitchen basics well stocked (oil, sauce, s&p, etc.) Very comfy bed and bedding. The only thing to note is the distance away from majority of wineries - can get taxi service but quite expensive. All in all, 5 star stay!"
16795559,407488833798717736,2021-07-16,274652673,Molly,"Sweetest cottage filled with character and surrounded by beautiful country. John and Jess were so hospitable and helpful, a truly great experience!"

From the moment we walked in till the moment we left, it was clear that an incredible amount of care had been taken to provide everything we could possibly need - from milk, coffee and herbal tea to a complementary bottle of wine, fresh figs and strawberries. Not to mention fresh homemade biscuits on departure! <br/><br/>It's very well positioned as well - a tranquil setting and right in the midst of the best wine region.<br/><br/>I'm already looking forward to my next stag and would highly recommend to anyone exploring the beautiful Barossa.

We were so well looked after, with some lovely little surprise extras. The breakfast was spot on with homemade granola, yummy bread, fresh strawberries and coffee. The place itself was simple and beautifully presented and it was so lovely to lie in bed with the papers listening to the church bells on Sunday morning. Would highly recommend the hike up the hill to the quarry to take in the views back over Light Pass and the vines... followed by a dip in the pool! We will be back."

Tracy left us delicious homemade cookies and granola and left milk, juice, fruit and wine. There was a coffee maker with coffee pods and tea with fresh lemon from their lemon tree. The property is surrounded by vineyards in the small town of Light  Pass in the northern part of the Barossa Valley. Perfect for exploring. Highly recommended."
17287788,207009551,2017-10-28,31786356,Sarah,"From start to finish, Tracy and Matt showed amazing hospitality and offered a truly unforgettable Airbnb experience. She allowed us to check in earlier. When walking into the cottage, we found baked cookies and sour dough bread, freshly prepared granola, fresh strawberries and a bottle of complimentary Yalumba wine. It was a very generous offering, not to mention delicious. The cottage was clean and cosy. Tracy and Matt were friendly and always available for any questions. Tracey even provided us crackers on the last night when we missed our chance to buy them as the local Foodland was closed. Thank you once again for the amazing hospitality. It made our Barossa trip unforgettable!"

Great little kitchenette with bread, granola and coffee included which we had each morning in the yard which was lovely. The two dogs and other family that we met were friendly and we were made to feel welcome. The shed is secluded in a quiet town but is close to Barossa vineyards (cab ride away, which was easy enough). The bed was comfy but very squeaky. The pool was great."

We were there in winter and found the back half of the house (toilet, laundry & bunk room) very cold and difficult to heat. Didn’t even check out the games room or bikes as found ourselves snuggled in front of TV on nights we stayed in. Appreciated the free access to Netflix. Bedrooms and living areas cosy and comfortable. House is not as contemporary as appears in photos but done up nicely."

17720616,593122621,2020-01-14,132589033,James,This was a lovely place to stay while my family and I visited the Barossa Valley.

17720616,619545131,2020-03-18,530942,Carrie,"What a house! We loved every aspect. Check in was easy with the code on the door. The house is well stocked with anything you would want for basic cooking, and we were able to make our own breakfast and coffee daily an eat on the patio outside. The beds have different firmness levels so you can pick the one that suits you best. We enjoyed playing pool and ping pong in the early evening.  And did I mention the bathtub?!? The neighborhood is very quiet and we slept well. There are a/c units if needed; the first night was chilly and there were extra blankets in the closet, and the next day was 94 Fahrenheit and we were able to use the a/c to keep us comfortable. We got amazing suggestions of things to do and places to go when we arrived, and all the good stuff in the Barossa is within a 15-20 minute drive.  We would absolutely stay here again."
17720616,720249419,2020-12-31,165570488,Carly,"We loved staying here. It's so close to everything, and has a beautiful garden/outdoor space for down time between trips to wineries. It also cost us the same to stay here in a spacious and comfortable house as it did for our friends to stay in a cabin at the caravan park. We'll stay here again."

We had all the amenities we needed, although the place was a little dated compared with the photos. The back bedroom with bunk beds is an extension to the rest of the house and quite chilly. Perfect stay for two couples in the two main rooms but probably not kids. The rest of the property was great to relax and enjoy yourself, outdoor patio to gardens to quiet neighbourhood street, bikes were a definite plus, thanks Cathy!"

The house is very well located, within easy walking distance to all that Tanunda has to offer. Games, books, bikes, etc, were great. It was cold when we stayed; the back area (bunk beds and toilet) was therefore a little frosty. In our view it wasn’t quite as clean and nice as the listing implied, however overall a good base to explore from."

It has charming gardens, a games shed where you can have hours of fun playing pool, darts and table tennis. Lots of different spaces to entertain, and good appliances to cook or prepare food. Old world charm and the comfort of modern updates, I had everything I needed to enjoy 5 nights here, and entertain family and friends. I highly recommend a stay here!"

17862552,159891629,2017-06-12,109908081,Mark,"Awesome!!!<br/><br/>Thanks you so much. We had the best weekend. We travelled as 8 adults sisters and cousins with their partners.Would recommend this house for either families or a group of couples wanting a Barossa experience , the home had everything you need. Great sound system, tv's all u want!!<br/>Thank you Jason, for giving us the best of weekends!<br/>Cheers<br/>Mark "
17862552,187304924,2017-08-26,25170465,Kanako,"The house is beautiful, very clean. The only challenge we had was we ran out of hot water on the second night. No Wi-Fi, only at an extra cost which we weren't aware of, no Telstra Air connection on the tv and the dvd was a little bit temperamental.  The hotwater system we found out later, has a timer so would recommend not taking a shower early evening. Just first thing or late at night as the hotwater system doesn't fill up again. <br/>Jason and his wife seemed nice enough. <br/>However couldn't recommend this place for the price."
17862552,189798498,2017-09-03,130188520,Adam,"We stayed here over the Barossa Gourmet weekend and it was everything we expected and more. Lovely, clean rooms and great spaces to sit and chat with a large group. Will most certainly stay here again if we head back to the Barossa."

The home is well located within Tanunda with everything in close proximity so ideal as a base for exploring the wonderful Barossa Valley.

The house was very clean when we arrived and the air conditioning was on and the house cool which was great as it was a 40 degree day. The house was well stocked with all the general supplies you would need and was very comfortable. We were two couples plus two small children under 2 and it was just perfect for our needs. The host Jasón was very easy to communicate with and was a fantastic host. Check in was super easy as well.

There are 4 bedrooms upstairs and 2.5 bathrooms. 2 of the bedrooms have tv's. Downstairs a family room overlooks the park, there is a fully equipped kitchen and a pool table which provided so much fun over our weekend. The layout of the house is fantastic and has spaces for everyone to relax whether you want time alone to read a book,  spend time with your group for a game of pool, etc, or have a quiet drink in the sitting room where a baby grand piano sits for anyone who can play. Jason, (host), was fantastic, replying to my messages within minutes. Thank you so much, our weekend was so relaxing, which was just what we all needed. We will definitely be back. A rare find."

17862552,402443447380244384,2021-07-09,179537303,Jason,An awesome place to stay in the Barossa valley. Big house that is great for families and couples. Pool table is a great addition to this place.
17862552,405307942271396731,2021-07-13,35932063,Meagan,Jason’s house is a great place for a large group. We were comfortable and Jason communicated well. <br/><br/>The welcome wine was nice (would prefer it was in an unopened bottle not a decanter from a hygiene perspective). The pod coffee machine was a good touch with Vitoria pods. <br/><br/>Overall the house was very clean and great for entertaining with the pool table. The down side for me was the soft furnishings are a little dated and beds a little on the firm side.
17862552,407521555520507468,2021-07-16,103745434,Anita,Lovely property conveniently close to everything in the Barossa. The pool table was a hit with the kids.
17862552,429198897136465681,2021-08-15,233941589,Kerrie,"Thank you Jason, we had an amazing weekend away in your beautiful Barossa Valley home. Clean and spacious, close to amenities and local Tanunda shops. Wineries are close for you to enjoy the divine wines of the Barossa region. Jason is a fantastic host and a great communicator. Thank you 🙂"
17862552,439387397383349578,2021-08-29,115600333,Karyn,"The house is spacious and in ideal location. It has a billiard table and a piano - but that doesn't make it luxury. It's a little tired. Was freezing when we arrived, not been used for a while so wasn't very welcoming. The owner was very nice and helpful when the heating didn't work on day one and the hot water ran out on day two. We were directed to reset the fusebox and boost the hot water which is frustrating. Overall good but certainly not luxury"
17862552,466945618637814137,2021-10-06,391741090,Julie,Highly recommend this great B&B. We loved every minute. The pool table was areal hit. Beautiful location overlooking a park.

17862552,500177345698649695,2021-11-20,103798904,Sacha,"The house was spacious and clean and looked exactly like the photos. It was perfect for our group (two families of 3). The pool table was a big hit with everyone. The kids loved the spa bath, and my son loved the bunk bed. I loved the huge dining table: there was plenty of room for all of us to sit down together. We had a great weekend, wish we could have stayed longer. Would absolutely stay there again. Thank you Jason!"
17862552,505261289328277642,2021-11-27,146857067,Gail,We had a wonderful stay in Tanunda. The house was in a good location and had excellent facilities.

She made us feel like we were at home and made our expierence extra special. We will definitely be coming back! I feel like 5 stars doesn't do this place justice."
17963507,143488382,2017-04-12,82385895,Cameron,"Lesley Ann's place was a welcome oasis after a long day touring the Barossa. She was a most hospitable and welcoming host, willing to guide us on our food and wine journey through the Barossa. Everything we needed was provided for and our stay was most enjoyable. "
17963507,144917703,2017-04-16,104879472,Emma,"Warm and knowledgeable hostess, fantastic location and a very luxurious and private studio, with all you could want for an indulgent stay in the Barossa - Thankyou Lesley Ann!"
17963507,146195104,2017-04-22,1487493,Luca,"Lesley Ann è persona molto di classe, disponibilissima e simpaticissima. La casa che mette a disposizione degli ospiti è meravigliosa, e solo la mancanza del bidet è un disagio che mi impedisce di dare il massimo punteggio. Il wifi funziona benone e non c'era traccia di insetti. La colazione fornita era gustosa e completa. Il giardino circostante è bello tranquillo e silenzioso e la zona è strategica per la Barossa Valley."
17963507,146883539,2017-04-24,17063249,Claire,"Lesley Ann is a fantastic host, her studio is beautiful and well appointed, very close to the centre of town. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and will definitely be back!"
17963507,148112408,2017-04-30,19157770,Ian,"The writers cottage at Tununda offers the perfect getaway for soulful self time, a romantic escape or just to enjoy the many and varied offerings of the colourful Barossa region. Perfectly located right in the heart of Tununda, character and charm ooze from from this little slice of heaven in the Adelaide Hills. Adorned with original artworks and quirky charm, the warmth of this little love nest is matched only only by the hospitality of its host Lesley-Anne and the beauty of its surroundings. Highly recommended, we’ll be back, both for Lesley Anne, the writers cottage itself and the fabulous varietals on offer in this unsurpassed wine making region "
17963507,152099642,2017-05-15,23269740,Sarah,"You will not be disappointed. This studio is perfect for a couple - plenty of space and privacy and lots of little comforts. It's also clean and cosy. The photos do not do it justice. We were absolutely thrilled when we arrived. The location is also perfect, being centrally positioned to explore wineries and you can easily walk to Fermentasian or Zwines, etc. for dinner. Lesley Ann was a lovely host, and she has obviously put a lot of TLC into the accommodation. "
17963507,153354077,2017-05-21,59674031,Chris,The studio is outstanding. Located 5mins walk from the Main Street but you feel like you're in your own little world. Lesley Ann was the perfect host with lots of good advice for places to visit. <br/>
17963507,156957882,2017-06-02,73725293,Nancy,"Leslie Ann's place is the best place we've stayed on our journey (and that's saying something for a 7 month trip).  Her place is well situated (all of the services you'll need are very close - and yet, the area is very quiet), plenty of room, the cottage is wonderfully decorated - and - very close to all Barossa wineries.  You will need a car for any serious exploration of the vast number of outstanding wineries. This place is extremely well located to get to all cellar doors.  Leslie Ann is a perfect host; extremely interesting to talk with (knows gobs about Barossa and about wine) and just an all around great person.  If you are going to Barossa - you've got to book Leslie Ann's place.  Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed."
17963507,157424320,2017-06-04,130238980,Annie,"Close to shops and restaurants, but felt like our own little hideaway.  Lesley Ann shared local knowledge of the area and great places to eat and visit.  Awesome host.  Thank you for sharing your home with us."
17963507,158688850,2017-06-08,8679013,Bobby Anne,"The photos are accurate but can't capture the wonderfully calm and positive ambience of the space.   The moment I walked in I knew that this was a special place.  Loads of space, lots of light from the large windows on three sides with completely private views onto the garden. Clean, cosy and comfortable.   A quiet, tranquil space and yet less to than 10 minutes walk to Murray Street  and the shops and restaurants.  (However, car necessary to go further afield.) Lesley Ann is the perfect, thoughtful host.  I definitely plan to stay here again.  Highly recommended for either a business trip or a holiday escape.  "
17963507,159899368,2017-06-12,5407410,Melissa,"We loved our stay in the writers studio. It was very clean, quiet, bright and very comfortable! <br/>Lesley Ann was a lovely host.

The bed was incredibly comfortable, I slept like a baby! Great cooking facilities, lots of books to read in the comfy mezzanine nook area and a beautiful garden. A lovely area that's very close to the shops, cafes and wineries. I hired a bike and cycled round the Barossa and this was the perfect base. Thank you Lesley Ann for being so lovely and welcoming, I'll be telling all my friends and family :)"
17963507,164343354,2017-06-27,60828455,Lawrence,Lovely place and an absolutely amazing host! Lesley Ann was extremely friendly and accommodating during our stay. She supplied us with inside information about the region and things to do. The accomodation was even better than described as Lesley Ann had left some local food for us to make breakfast with. Location was also on point. 😊
17963507,165753437,2017-07-02,21027178,Ana,Had a lovely weekend: Leslie Ann was a generous & welcoming host and the home was warm & comfortable.  Would definitely come again another day!  Thank you so much!
17963507,167771613,2017-07-08,10180747,James,"What a great little getaway in the Barossa. A cozy studio, close to town, but nicely tucked away it’ll be like your own little retreat. If it’s raining, you definitely won’t feel guilty about staying in and keeping cosy in the studio for an afternoon. <br/>Lesley Ann is full of great recommendations and knows everything about the region. We really appreciated Lesley Ann’s  kind spirit and knowledgeable. <br/>We wouldn’t think twice about staying in the Writer’s Studio next time we visited the Barossa. Thanks Lesley Ann!<br/><br/><br/>"
17963507,168693135,2017-07-10,133154642,Jessica,"We had a truly wonderful weekend at the Writer's Shed. Lesley provided a very warm welcome, and had decked out the fridge with all the necessities for a cup of a tea and a cooked breakfast. This was particularly appreciated after we left our bag of food back home in Adelaide! The place was so much more beautiful in real life than the photos could capture, we didn't want to leave. Lesley is a fantastic host, and was very willing to provide us with tips to maximise our weekend stay. Will spread the word and hopefully be back!"
17963507,169248026,2017-07-12,23252327,Jennifer,"Perfect place, in a great location. Very responsive and generous host. The place was cosy and filled with great jigsaw puzzles and books to keep us occupied. Would stay again!  "

17963507,170532543,2017-07-15,9566451,Simone,"The Barossa Valley is fantastic: great wines, tasty food and beautiful landscape. The writer's studio is a beautifully/tastefully decorated self-contained shed, with good facilities, very quiet, and centrally located, providing access (by car) to all villages nearby. Lesley Ann was a great host, offering her local knowledge of the region, but also providing us with privacy. The only problem we found was the inflatable bed, which was not very comfortable."
17963507,171562578,2017-07-18,32202732,Anna,"The Writer's Studio was a really fantastic place to get away for a few days.

We would absolutely stay again. "
17963507,172428317,2017-07-21,52727609,Emily,"We stayed at the Writer's studio as the last stop on a two week holiday - it was the highlight of our trip! Lesley Ann welcomed us warmly with a hand written note, fresh bread and milk, and supplies for bacon and eggs for breakfast.<br/><br/>The studio is comfortable, warm and clean and is decorated with so many interesting pieces of art. The blow up bed has a base and a pump to top it up and we found that it was as comfortable as a normal bed. Lesley Ann was also extremely attentive and immediately followed up an unavoidable maintenance issue. <br/><br/>We really loved the selection of puzzles, books and games, the little mezzanine floor was the perfect spot to relax in the afternoon with a cup of tea and a book.<br/><br/>Our advice is for everyone to ask Lesley Ann where they should visit in the Barossa. Her recommendations made our holiday, we wish we could give an extra star. We would come back here in a heart beat - next time for a longer stay! "
17963507,173792641,2017-07-24,131966807,Loan,Beautiful and very cosy. Close to the shops and walkable distance to the main cafes and street of Tanunda. It is tucked away so no traffic noise. Such a beautiful stay with a gracious host. Extremely clean and we appreciated the breakfast ingredients and fresh bread! Lesley Ann is an amazing hostess and the Writer's Studio is a must for a couple looking for a quick getaway from city life! 
17963507,174747233,2017-07-27,132006164,Tyler,"Thank you so much Lesley Ann!! This was such a beautiful location, house and all round experience. The studio was so warm, homely and inviting. There were beautiful flowers outside and views from the attic. There is no doubt I'll be back to get some quiet study done or be in close vicinity to Barossas best wineries again. Thanks :)"

It was my first time in the Barossa and the location couldn't have been better, nor could I have asked for anything more from Lesley Ann as a host and the studio - was so well stocked, and a little bit magical! Lesley Ann made it feel as though we were staying at the back of an old friend's place, with lots of local tips and hot spots of where to go for great food and wine. She was so lovely, I'll definitely be back!"

Leslie Ann was a lovely host and she had lots of great suggestions about places to eat/drink but at the same time she gave us lots of privacy during our stay. It didn’t feel like we were on someone else’s property. The tv had chrome cast which was awesome and Leslie Ann provided us with bacon and eggs for us to cook breakfast which was a lovely touch.

I especially loved sitting in the loft area with the lights off with a cup of mint tea and star gazing.<br/>Lesley-Ann was a great host and gave me lots of tips for food and wineries in the local area and we had a nice chat about our travels (and cats). <br/>The house itself is about 5 minutes walk from the visitor centre and opposite a winery so the location is perfect. Would definitely recommend and stay again."

Lesley Ann was so kind and welcoming. We would definitely stay again and have recommended the place to others."
17963507,243423444,2018-03-16,4375002,Mary Lee,"This is such a fun and comfortable spot for a great time in the Barossa Valley. If you enjoy wine Lesley Ann if a well of knowledge.

17963507,250688378,2018-04-06,9003844,Stefanie,"Our stay at Lesley Ann's place was amazing. The studio is large and light with beautiful details and thoughtful decoration. The kitchen is well appointed with a great communal dining table - the bathroom is sparkling with a good shower. There's a plethora of interesting reads, games and jigsaw puzzles in the cosy lounge which is perfect for sharing a glass of wine in the evening. Situated just off the main street in Tanunda, the studio is perfectly located to access some of the best scenery and vineyards in the Barossa. Lesley Ann gave us some fantastic local tips and really went out of her way to make us feel welcome and part of the local community. We would wholeheartedly recommend staying at the studio on your next trip to the Barossa!"
17963507,251423011,2018-04-08,45144251,Elyse,"We had a beautiful stay at the Writers Studio while we were in the Barossa for a wedding.

17963507,258870668,2018-04-30,153829537,Lucy,"Lesley Ann's place is the perfect spot for a weekend exploring the Barossa. The studio space itself is quirky, comfortable and beautiful and had everything my partner and I needed. It is a short walk to the main street in Tanunda including the Foodland if you need to stock up. There is also an amazing Cellar Door on the corner of Lesley Ann's street and the main rd, Z Wines. <br/>Although the studio is at the back of Lesley Ann's place it is private and quiet. Lesley Ann was a fabulous host and was able to recommend a number of great spots for wine tasting and eating and we will most certainly be back to check out those we couldn't make it to all in the weekend. Cannot thank Lesley Ann enough!"
17963507,260457309,2018-05-04,125315518,Jess,"This is by far the best place to stay in Barossa. Really loved our time here. It’s a really large space, feels private and tucked away at the back of the house. It’s a cute converted shed with amazing decor and a nice outlook on the garden. The kitchen is completely stocked with everything you could need. We were treated to fresh bread/eggs and bacon on arrival which was such a nice touch. The bed was so comfortable, doesn’t feel like a blow up at all. Had the best sleeps in it! Did not want to leave. The location is perfect for exploring Barossa, right out the front of a winery. Thanks Lesley for the tips and hospitality. We will be back."

Had such a lovely stay, the writer’s studio is beautiful and cosy and private also. So many nice touches too, such as the breakfast goodies and welcome note! Great location, close to eateries and wineries, can’t recommend Lesley Ann’s place and Tanunda itself for a break away from it all."

Lesley Ann is to be congratulated on her initiative to create such comfortable and interesting accommodation. The studio is ideal for two people and has all the comforts and provisions of home plus extra. We stayed here for one week in total comfort and was a highlight of our time in the Barossa.

We loved the fresh bread, eggs and tomatoes left for us to create a tasty breakfast. The bed is super comfy and the gorgeous lighting  in the studio adds to the cozy feel. It’s walking distance to 1918 for dinner, which was lovely. And Lesley Ann’s recommendation for The Eatery at Maggie Beers for lunch and Artisans of Barossa for wine tasting were spot on. We can’t wait to return to the area again!"

It is in the back of a lovely property, surrounded by a large, green backyard, and tones of quirky artsy details!<br/>Lesley Ann kindly left some yummy goodies for us to enjoy during breakfast. She was very easy to communicate with. She lives in the main house within the property - however, the deck has lots of privacy.  <br/>Close to shops etc, and short drive to nice wineries and restaurants :)"

We spent two days there during winter....the weather was pretty wet on one day and we had no hestiation staying indoors, cooking lunch and sharing a bottle or two of local wine.  Take your time to look at all the books that surround one of the walls. The location is just down the road from the local Foodland, near the Workers Club...(great for a meal) and also down the road from Z a winebar...what more do you need?"

It was quiet and private also close to town and right in the Barossa. (We booked a tour for one of the days so we could both have drinks and they picked us up and dropped us off at the front which was great). Lesley Ann was a great host, she provided us with delicious breakfast supplies. We had fresh (locally made) bread, bacon, eggs and coffee everyday which meant we could set off exploring easily without searching for breakfast first in town (fantastic!) Lesley Ann had some great recommendations, we went to a number of wineries and restaurants she suggested and loved them all! We highly recommend staying here. Thank you again for a great stay Lesley Ann."

Alle elements in there: calm, rest, books, even set of dvd and chromecast, kitchen well equipped though only one heatpit, bathroom immaculate and a treat.<br/>Location is also great: from here you just walk within 10 mins to the best winebar and restaurant in town, how great is that.<br/>Lesley Ann is a perfect host. I work in wine and she provided me with the exact right directions. She more than knows her way around the wineries so her advice is gold. And she gives you all the space you need but is always available to help out. And she is just a very kind, good and smart & savvy person.<br/>This place was just what I needed, travelling alone and with my roadbike, as a base for cycletraining through the Barossa and visiting the best wineries in the area, all in a short timeperiod."

We loved the open plan design and great location as only a short walk to the Main Street and lovely wine bars. Being able to pick delicious peaches off the tree out the back door was a real treat. Lesley Ann was there for any help if needed but we had privacy as we were in the back corner of the garden away from the beautiful main house."
17963507,729119194,2021-02-05,36180411,Rocky,The Writer's Studio is in a fantastic location enclosed in a beautiful garden and Lesley Ann has great knowledge of the valley.

17963507,742035705,2021-03-25,10736588,Kylie,"Had the most wonderful 3 night getaway at Lesley Ann's home. The writer's studio is a big, beautiful lofted studio behind her house, among the lovely garden and orchard. The studio had plenty of books and puzzles to occupy your time, though we were fairly busy visiting wineries throughout the day! The location is perfect for walking to dinner in Tanunda and is only about a 10 minute drive to the furthest wineries in the area. There is a little kitchen with everything you need to make breakfast and coffee, and Lesley Ann even went as far as to supply us with some fresh bread, eggs, bacon, and tomatoes. She is a lovely host and was available for any questions or recommendations. We hope to come back again and make use of the puzzles next time! Thank you Lesley Ann."
17963507,743428538,2021-03-29,316910640,Bianca,"Wow! What a place, what a location! Our expectations were well and truly exceeded with our stay, the photos don’t do the Studio justice - we honestly loved everything about our stay. Walking distance to the heart of Tanunda (stumbling distance back) - we didn’t use the car from arrival to departure. <br/>Brekky goodies generous in nature, not just your basic cereal but a fresh loaf, eggs, bacon - and fresh plunger coffee. <br/>Clean, comfy and a little quaint & quirky - we immediately felt at home which we were so grateful for. <br/>We will be recommending to friend and family and only hope that the Studio is not booked out when we try to book again. We won’t look anywhere else for our next trip to the Barossa. Thank you Lesley Ann for everything, we’re so grateful :)"

You will love the comfy, snuggly bed, well appointed kitchen area (with full sized fridge, stocked with lovely breakfast staples, and pantry staples in the cupboard).  Cook to your heart's desire with the full complement of cook and tableware, or dine out at one or more of the many great restaurants, clubs, pubs and cafes that abound in the area.  Or if you feel like a few hours whiling away time and relaxing, feel free to pick something from the well appointed bookshelves, be it a book, a jigsaw puzzle, or a board game.  Go on, book a weekend away here; you know you want to...."

Really comfortable space (and bed). Top quality linen/towels, breakfast supplies (sadly I was too full to eat the  fresh eggs & bacon), local coffee beans, as a tea drinker I was impress with the selection (not everyone likes English Breakfast) and the homemade bread with lashings of butter (my highlight!).

Peter and Marijan were the best hosts we could ask for; they made sure we had everything we needed, were easy to get hold of, and offered us a late check out. Marijan even left us amazing pikelets and comquat marmalade!!! She's a gem!! The cottage is quaint and cosy. A woodfire in the living room hearkens to the cooler months ensconsed in the inviting warmth of the fire with a fabulous red and a book. The gardens are remarkable; we had the chance to observe the changeling colours of autumn in the trees. We imagine spring would be amazing too. There is a vineyard to meander through, and lamas and sheep share this wonderful retreat with you. We cannot wait to return and spend a few days retreating in these beautiful surrounds. "

The host went the extra mile to make us welcome and feel like we were at home. The history was lost on the boys but it wasn't hard to see."

17980547,168115449,2017-07-09,26181840,Jacquie,"Marijan and Peter's cottage is a special place. You can pick your poison there: relax by the open fire, breathe deep as you wander the beautiful property, or jump in your car for a delicious visit to a local cellar door. The accommodation is just as it is described - very functional and comfortable. The open fire kept the cottage perfectly warm and added wonderful atmosphere. Marijan was a fantastic host. She had the cottage prepped for every eventuality, made us pikelets, and stayed up late to greet us as we arrived in the pouring rain. Make sure you take her up on her offer to have a tour around the property - it is wonderful. We will definitely be coming back to Martinsell. We loved it. "
17980547,169550283,2017-07-13,2777604,Michael,Awesome hosts - went out of their ways to accommodate us. Will definitely recommend and stay here again.
17980547,170589684,2017-07-16,136840888,Tim,"Lovely county property. Right at Mt Crawford for walking, bike/horse riding. Great view out across the paddock. Well equipped for family weekend away. Great hosts. "
17980547,172792273,2017-07-22,9670622,Antony,"Marijan greeted us at the gate and had the fire roaring for us on arrival. It's a quiet old property with sheep and alpacas roaming freely. The cottage is decorated in a simple style and is impeccably clean and comfortable. We brought our own cheese platter and a meal to pop in the oven so we were playing cards in front of the fire in no time. We opted to spend the next day on a short hike up Mt Crawford and then a drive through Angaston, Tanunda and Birdwood. Marijan's place was the ideal accommodation to feel like we'd really gotten away from it all and we'd love to return some day to see more of the area."
17980547,177811056,2017-08-04,25445354,Lisa,Gorgeous property in the barossa with plenty of wildlife!  The sheep and alpacas were lovely to watch and the indoor fire was cozy.   I would definitely recommend this roomy cottage!
17980547,178585826,2017-08-06,26973596,Malcolm & Lynn,"Peter and Marijan's property is in easy reach of Barossa Valley wineries and sites, numerous walking trails like the Heysen Trail and mountain bike routes. It is also perfect for relaxing. It is an interesting and historic property important for the history of the Barossa. Our accommodation was above the original barn, simple, functional, exceptionally clean and a little old fashioned. We loved Marijan's pikelets, the tour of the main house and the efficient combustion heater in the cold winter's weather. Thank you Marijan and Peter for minding our bags and the enjoyable stay."
17980547,184490394,2017-08-20,112872020,Varuni,"Peter and Marijan's place was lovely. It was on a road less traveled but the property was charming and old worldly. Because it has a history - the property is getting restored bit by bit and it's wonderful to step back in time and take in the atmosphere. We wanted a break and a breather from the city and the place was exceptional. Billy and Sterling (the Alpacas) were adorable and we loved the tour of the property. Our son got to experience what it is like to be a farmer. Overall it was a wonderful stay and because it's a short drive to Williamstown, Tanunda and Angoston, we enjoyed the local eateries and delicacies as well. Wonderful place to stay while on holiday."
17980547,186205246,2017-08-24,1741798,Kari,Oh my goodness if you want to experience a beautiful rustic retreat then this is the place to go. We were greeted with a warm cottage and some friendly alpacas. Our beds were so warm and cosy had the best sleep and that fresh country air just added to it all. Do your self a favour if you're going to the Barossa stay here.
17980547,187933918,2017-08-28,57346159,Adam,"Thank you for the very peaceful  and warm stay at your beautiful place. the whole place was perfect and the hosts are super friendly, i couldn't have hoped for anything more"
17980547,192171641,2017-09-10,60859337,Glenn,"Quiet, secluded, fresh air, very special farmhouse type ambience. <br/>Marijan is a very welcoming host. <br/>The home itself is simple yet comfortable, like walking back 40 years in time and some of the furnishings and implements match that era. <br/>Lovely to wake up and see ""Dorper"" sheep grazing outside your window. The legendary Roos did not make an appearance but we didn't miss it!<br/>The surroundings are lovely for walking and exploring<br/>and offer ruins, pine forests, streams and vistas of rolling hills. <br/>For a family used to life in inner Adelaide, this was quite magical."
17980547,195008377,2017-09-18,10687993,Tina,Lovely farm style stay in beautiful rural surroundings. Thank you for hosting 😊

17980547,210347964,2017-11-09,100968803,Amy,"Don't miss the opportunity to stay at Martinsell and Pewsey Vale! Marijan and Peter have created the most beautiful place here -- the cottage is in such a glorious setting, and the sheep, alpacas and old gums make it really special.  Marijan has thought of everything, and their tips for outings and places to eat were spot on. Our son will never forget helping hand-feed the baby lamb and the alpaca gents. Thank you so much for a gorgeous couple of days -- we hope to be back!"
17980547,210941652,2017-11-11,138044246,Noel,We would highly recommend this as a stay for groups both big and small. The property is incredibly picturesque and is ideal for relaxing outside or taking walks. <br/><br/>The cottage was spacious and comfortable with everything we needed. The host Marijan was very hospitable in offering us a tour of the property; the stories behind the manor  and the gardens added a tremendous amount of enjoyment for us as a group.<br/><br/>The area is easily accessible with a car and the local wineries and town markets are a short drive away. Without a doubt we would love to go back.
17980547,212230360,2017-11-16,143062870,John,"We had a great time at Martinsell Cottage and would return there anytime. We loved the pleasant and unique rural location. Marijan met us at the gate (it was drizzling) and welcomed us in. We learned the history of the property, which we partly knew, enjoyed the convivial atmosphere and the guided tour of their property.  Mt Crawford and Martinsell is a great place to visit."
17980547,216449961,2017-12-03,75122823,Craig,"Wonderful greeting with freshly cut roses and plenty of helpful advice regarding the Barossa from Marijan. The location was excellent with everything a nice driving distance, yet very quiet and tranquil. Thoroughly recommend for anyone visiting the area."
17980547,218603983,2017-12-13,150251357,Leanne,Peter and Marijan were great  hosts who warmly welcomed us....a lovely touch of paradise and a wonderful place to stay in the Barossa ...highly recommend...

17980547,222878251,2017-12-31,11004166,Vanessa,Beautiful cottage in a stunning part of the world. Marijan and Peter were fantastic hosts- so welcoming and helpful in every way. The alpacas and sheep were a huge hit with our young girls and the location is fabulous. Very close to all the attractions of the Barossa.
17980547,224670540,2018-01-03,140018607,Akira,Marijian helps a lot and very friendly.<br/>Very relaxing place with the nature.
17980547,225560081,2018-01-07,17665342,Brent,"Peter and Marijan made us feel so very at home in their beautiful cottage. Marijan even gave us a private tour of their stunning sprawling property! There are sheep and alpaca running around, all very friendly, and the cottage has everything you need. A quiet and cozy place, 20 minutes drive from the centre of the Barossa. I recommend staying here as the drive to town is beautiful, with a limit over the region as you drive in to town. I can't wait for them to finish the work on their château, as it is already looking amazing and luxurious, and a great alternative to the cottage."
17980547,226463417,2018-01-10,71060757,Paulo,"Very friendly, comfortable house, spotless clean and Marijan and Peter will be the best hosts of your trip!!"
17980547,238004162,2018-02-25,22552902,Lisa,"Marijan has been an absolutely wonderful host! She has given us local tips on where to eat and visit, showed us the manor (including recounting its heritage), and also allowed us to visit her wonderful sheep and alpacas. The place itself is very peaceful and the air is simply so fresh and crisp. We would love to visit again!"

17980547,282980682,2018-06-28,128978056,Noreen,"The Cottage was so spacious,  well furnished with everything you could want, a lovely wood fire as well as the reverse cycle meant the main living area was toasty and warm.  The hosts are really lovely people who could not have been more friendly and approachable.  The property itself is magnificent, with  the most beautiful gum trees and grounds with wonderful old buildings full of character."
17980547,284674608,2018-07-02,190169745,Brendan,This gorgeous cottage is in an absolutely picturesque location. Waking to see the magnificent sunrise over the vineyards and walking amongst the grounds is a magical experience. The cottage is warm and has everything you need to enjoy it’s peaceful location. We simply LOVED our stay.
17980547,286734371,2018-07-07,189673610,Mahesh,Lovely county property. The hosts are super friendly We had a great time at Martinsell Cottage ..
17980547,291499752,2018-07-16,30513683,Lina,"I highly recommend Marijan and Pete's Martinsell Cottage. The place was big, clean and  had everything we you could possible need.<br/>Marijan gave us great recommendations on places to eat, to visit, best scenic roads, and was very helpful every step of the way.<br/>My favorite part of the holidays spent in the Barossa was the tour around this property, we fed the sheep and the alpacas, had a walk around the vineyard and heard the amazing history behind this beautiful property.  There is no money that could pay to make up and go for a walk around Martinsell Place, I completely love the property and would love to go back."
17980547,298044842,2018-07-29,22671174,Kalyna,An amazing weekend away in the most perfect place. I feel so rejuvenated and will definitely be returning.

17980547,329453332,2018-09-29,76734026,Crystal,"The Martinsell Cottage sits alongside Martinsell Manor. Both are listed on Airbnb although the cottage is where we stayed, due to our more modest budget! We found it to be of great value and the hosts were wonderful - Marijan even took us on a tour of the grounds and manor, which was very interesting. Marijan and her husband Peter are meticulously recovering and renovating the manor and other parts of the property.<br/>The cottage is clean and pleasant. The kitchen is fully functional and comes with tea, coffee and basic breakfast supplies. The bathroom is clean and large, and the water is hot with reasonable water pressure. So lovely to have a fireplace in the lounge room also! While there are no facilities for babies, Marijan was more than happy for us to bring our 3 month old, and we just brought our own portacot.<br/>The Martinsell Cottage is a convenient and comfortable base for exploring Barossa wineries by car, and we would definitely stay there again!"
17980547,335681581,2018-10-12,208125068,Carol,"Amazing place.  Quiet, slightly out of the way but close to every thing you need in the Barossa.  Lie in bed in the morning and only here the animals, birds and bees.  Huge place from two people to six, would be great place for large family with kids also.  Tour of the property is a total added bonus.  What has been achieved in two years is mind boggling.  Conserving all that history!  I will be back."
17980547,337610837,2018-10-17,1249619,Shirley,We had a lovely stay at the cottage. Great communication and hosting from Marijan and Peter. Would love to be back.

17980547,341414660,2018-10-26,15269551,Michael,"Fantastic rural location deep in the Barossa vineyards. Peter & Marijan were lovely hosts & gave some great advice about wineries, etc. Very interesting main house, stunning grounds and nice to meet & feed the Alpacas. Would love to have stayed longer."
17980547,345374072,2018-11-04,2404278,Alicia,we loved our stay in this beautiful old cottage. lovely rural propery with sheep bleating. good base to explore barossa and adelaide hills. Marian was a warm and generous host and gave aus a tour and history of the property.
17980547,350311340,2018-11-19,225365387,Kelly,Awesome views and great place to be to relax and unwind among the sheep.

17980547,354476217,2018-12-01,34181114,Kiaran,"We stayed for two nights in Marijan and Peter's cottage on their very scenic property.  The cottage itself was extremely comfortable, clean, and well equipped.  Marijan was a perfect host, meeting us on arrival (and very flexible when we changed our arrival time late in the day) and giving us a very interesting tour of the property, including the manor house, fitting in with our schedule to do so.  We had some marvellous meals in the cottage, prepared in the well-equipped kitchen.  When a (rare and brief) power cut, caused by an intense electrical storm, threatened one of our dinners Marijan came over straight away and helped us with setting up a BBQ.  It was an excellent and restful stay in a beautiful part of the country."
17980547,361133254,2018-12-22,69859090,James,"Quiet, relaxing hub for visiting the Barossa."

17980547,368746803,2019-01-07,108297669,Carolyn,"This was the place we just couldn't get enough of, even after 5 days there. Peter and Marian are such good folks, very accommodating hosts, and full of helpful tips for what to do and see.  You basically will have your own country estate, complete with a spacious house, a small flock of sheep amongst the enormous red gum trees, the occasional kangaroo, and two friendly alpacas. The furnishings in the house are simple but quite adequate. The house itself and the other buildings on the property are lovingly restored from their early days, and are wonderful. It's out of town and up in the hills, but still an easy drive to shops, wineries, etc. The more rural setting added a lot to its appeal for us. We loved it!"
17980547,411551885,2019-02-12,1625715,Katherine,"The cottage is an amazing space that is just perfect as a base to explore the Barossa valley. The cottage has everything you need, and is consistently styled in the 1970’s theme. The kitchen is fully equipped, and there are plenty of blankets for cold nights. It was just the two of us staying, but the space can comfortably fit three generations with the three great bedrooms and multiple bathrooms. The views on the property are stunning. We were able to walk around the property, even to their vineyard which was so great. There’s lots of amazing animals on the property too, and you can spy sheep, alpaca, and kangaroos from the cottage. The location is totally private, and yet conveniently located to cellar door locations for making the most of the region. We also got a tour of the manor, which is suited for a very luxurious stay. I would highly recommend it, and would come back here again"
17980547,424508420,2019-03-17,113297799,Barry,"If you want to escape to a peaceful oasis at the end of busy winery and township touring, this is just the place to stay. This comfortable, spacious cottage, nestled among ancient gums and towering pines is a perfect, economical  refuge with wildlife, vineyards and livestock within metres of the door! A place of very interesting Australian history and a chance to witness great work-in-progress on the nearby stone buildings by the hosts. Don't miss this!"
17980547,425751767,2019-03-19,23578858,Julie,Martinsell Cottage is in a lovely setting which is peaceful and quiet. Marijan and Peter are friendly and helpful and the cottage has everything you need. It was a perfect base for our Heysen Trail walks not too far from Williamstown or Tanunda. It was lovely to look over Martinsell Manor and see all the work they have done there. We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay.
17980547,442186732,2019-04-23,62045796,Jane,Great place to stay in the Barossa if you love country and farm animals. Great host too and we really enjoyed our stay.
17980547,444339358,2019-04-27,10784983,Tim,"A great place to get away from it all. Our kids loved feeding the sheep and thinking they were farmers for a few days. Peter and Marijan were lovely, helped us out with local tips and showed us around their property. The house decor is unashamedly straight from 1982, but everything works and it is part of the charm. Very scenic property and outlooks, it really does make you shift gears while you’re there. Enjoy!"
17980547,453438473,2019-05-15,141436802,Theodore,Martinsell cottage is a hidden treasure in every way. Magnificent property quiet and private very relaxing.  Comfortable bed lovely warm wood fire. The tour of the farm premises is very worth the time. We can recommend this accommodation.

17980547,547787485,2019-10-16,170994825,James,"Very lovely place and host. Warm greeting was great, tour of the property. The cottage has a really awesome ambiance and feel to it, really thoughtful decoration but also practical. <br/><br/>Fire place was really cozy and the beds were very nice looking and comfortable. <br/><br/>Classic cottage that I know will be enjoyed by many! And peter and Marijan were more than lovely and very helpful in helping us experience as much of the area as we could!"

17980547,627738938,2020-06-04,70321192,Juris,Very welcoming hosts who have taken on the restoration of a historic property.<br/>The cottage was very comfortable and warm during some very chilly winter nights. The property is set in the quiet country side of the Barossa Valley and close to walking trials but still within close proximity to all tourist attractions and wineries. The best of both worlds.
17980547,628414736,2020-06-08,196922963,Pierre,A lovely place situated on a huge farm.   Perfect for autumn - surrounded by oaks and eucalypts with a large combustion heater in the lounge room.   A serene get-away that is ideal for couples and families.
17980547,635276273,2020-07-05,171047700,Nicky,"Such a great time away, was a cold July weekend but the cottage was warm and cozy. Beds were so comfortable. Our kids really enjoyed the farm and didn’t want to leave. Peter and Marijan were so nice and thoughtful. Marijan even brought a tub of LEGO down for my kids to play with one night and supplied some froot loops for them - they were wrapped. We also enjoyed exploring their property and were totally in ore of their magnificent homestead and tranquil gardens. It was like nothing I have seen before. They have put so much work and heart Into their property and it really shows... Hope to return for another visit in the future. I can definitely recommend."
17980547,636049896,2020-07-09,153182947,Andrew,Such wonderful hospitality in a glorious location. Highly recommend.
17980547,637048645,2020-07-12,66713642,Jules,"Martinsell Cottage is a wonderful place to stay. Warm log fire, games and videos, well-equipped kitchen and plenty of comfortable beds made it a perfect place for a family of 6 adults to stay. The location is divine - set among gorgeous trees and surrounded by sheep, lambs and alpacas. Marijan was a lovely host who made us feel very welcome and  showed us around the manor garden and property, imparting the local history to us. The Heysen trail is close by. The rest of the Barossa easily accessible. We wish we could have stayed longer. A really lovely place to stay. Thank you!"
17980547,637973211,2020-07-14,352258343,Joanna,Highly recommend for a family holiday.  Baby lambs just gorgeous!  Billy and Stirling the Alpaca's also need to get a mention!  Cozy cottage and breath-taking scenery!
17980547,638846554,2020-07-17,272942924,Jenny,"The setting is peaceful and private, the beds are exquisitely comfortable & we highly recommend Peter & Marijan’s Airbnb."
17980547,642455309,2020-07-26,92045038,Catherine,Fabulous 1901 cottage in a beautiful area of SA. Hosts were welcoming and promptly responded to all questions prior to our arrival. We would definitely stay there again.
17980547,645480224,2020-08-02,127725283,Michael,"Amazing grounds and hosts. Marijan had great information about the Barossa and surrounds. The cottage was very spacious and homey, which made our weekend very pleasant. Highly recommend staying at Martinsell cottage if you want a weekend to remember."
17980547,648504346,2020-08-09,195580428,Erin,"Absolutely wonderful stay! The photos don't do justice to how quiant and beautiful the cottage property is. Loved seeing the sheep and little lambs roaming around and the fire was great. Great communication with Marijan. Would love to stay again, perfect little getaway."
17980547,656218063,2020-08-25,49577128,Karen,"Beautiful grounds, lovely cottage with friendly greetings from the hosts throughout our stay."
17980547,659262662,2020-09-01,356456703,Eleanor,A great place to have a quiet peaceful break from the stresses of liife
17980547,663455742,2020-09-12,363035887,Michael,"It’s a beautiful historic place on a beautiful piece of land. Marijan has a lot of knowledge of both the area and the property itself. The cottage is a repurposed old shearing shed which is great. The amenities are simple and the overall aesthetic of the inside is a bit rustic, however, you can see this clearly in the photos and at this price point you can’t be beaten. The oven takes quite some time to preheat but it is fully functional. The animals are very cute too. You will love this place."
17980547,664972690,2020-09-16,163720830,Jenn,Outstanding property and location! Nothing to fault at all! Come and enjoy...you will not be disappointed...Jenn
17980547,667922735,2020-09-26,107586837,Mrunal,Highly recommend! Waking up amongst the alpacas and sheep in that setting was amazing!
17980547,671403680,2020-10-05,225307887,Rob,"Very special thanks Marijan and Peter for your friendly hospitality, with your welcome, presentation of the spacious cottage, and thoughtfulness of a bonfire & BBQ - a great evening!  And providing us with a beautiful 'farm-stay' and gateway into the magnificent Barossa region for 5 superb days / nights of activities.  We will be back!  Warm regards, Rob & guests"
17980547,672255818,2020-10-08,370789391,Monica,"The cottage is the old shearers quarters from the early 1900s. I love old architecture! The quarters were wonderfully cosy like staying at Nanna's. Everything was clean, tidy, comfortable... warm! We loved having the fire going as it was the last traces of Winter. The sounds of the sheep during the night was magical. We hope to come back and explore some more another time."
17980547,700728880,2020-10-16,147604557,Maria,"This place is marvellous but if you have been reading the reviews you already know this.  Please note there is no Wifi and the signal comes and goes.  But we managed very well.  Please note that at the gate that you have to open and drive through, there is a cattle grid.  For those a little unsteady on their feet you have to be very cautious.  When we were there (October 2020) many of the wineries were closed, some only opened on weekends and some that were open charge a fee for tasting, supposedly because of extra precautions that have to be taken due to Covid (at least that was what one winery told us).  Not certain this is the real reason.  I get the feeling that, unlike McLaren Vale that doesn't usually charge for tastings, this is the go in the Barossa.  So plan well.  Overall it was a wonderful stay enhanced by unexpected little treats.  It is certainly great value for money."
17980547,704955741,2020-10-30,26138808,Courtney,"Amazing location, tranquil, peaceful and loved having the sheep and Billy and Sterling nearby!"
17980547,706503565,2020-11-03,136858364,Sharon,"This cottage is in a lovely countryside setting.  The owners were happy for us to walk anywhere on the property, including through their beautiful garden area.  The cottage itself is comfortable and spacious and there are sheep and alpacas on the property.  Peter and Marian are friendly hosts who are great custodians of the history of this special place."
17980547,707299995,2020-11-08,164698052,Sarah,Very friendly hosts who are full of local knowledge. The cottage is fantastic and definitely in the 1970’s theme which is awesome.
17980547,708401277,2020-11-12,283102985,Rob,"We had an absolutely lovely time at Peter and Marijan's place. The flat is spacious, comfortable and with a superb view from each window. It rained a bit while we were there, but that didn't matter as we were perfectly happy to spend the time inside.<br/>Peter and Marijan met us on arrival, filled us in on the local area and Marijan later took us on a tour of the garden. The property has an abundance of land on which to walk and just hang out amongst the trees, and the towns of Williamstown, Lyndoch and Tanunda are just a short and beautiful drive away.<br/>If they'll have us, we'll be back at Peter and Marijan's in the not too distant future.<br/>Highly recommended."
17980547,709323708,2020-11-16,58546889,Johanna,Martinsell Cottage is lovely and the hospitality is great. Perfect location to explore Barossa Valley.
17980547,713592168,2020-12-05,374260117,Amanda,"We absolutely loved our weekend away. We explored the garden took multiple photos of the beautiful buildings. Explored nearby the old school house on the edge of the forest and the heysen trail. If you love places steeped in history you’ll love this place. Thank you to Marijan and Peter for your ease in booking, the clean space and the sharing of the proud history. You’ve done a marvellous job with it all."
17980547,715030443,2020-12-12,83640011,Nicola,"The Martinsell property was beautiful - the big old gums, free ranging animals, beautiful manor and gardens. <br/>The cottage itself was comfortable, clean and had lots of extra touches that make it very homey. We enjoyed reading about the history of the place, and the kids loved the bridge to the entrance! <br/>Thanks for having us 🙂"
17980547,715814367,2020-12-16,128200958,Kacee,Breathtaking spot. The cottage is so charming and felt so comfy. The gardens were beautiful and it was incredibly peaceful being here. Our hosts were so kind and lovely and extremely knowledgeable about the history of this beautiful site. 5 Stars!!
17980547,717976246,2020-12-24,251061256,Ulises,"Peter and Marijan’s cottage is located in a beautiful property where you can choose to be based to visit close by wineries, or just stay for as long as you want and unwind by reading a book, observing their sheep and alpacas or walking around. Totally recommended, and both of them will be up for a chat and give both local tips and extensive background on the region if you ask them :)"
17980547,719911489,2020-12-30,350256152,Peter,"A lovely place to stay, with all the comforts of home. Beautifully quiet setting with friendly sheep and alpacas. Very convenient to Barossa wineries and cafes, but a world away from them. Highly recommended."
17980547,721806366,2021-01-03,26228839,Phoebe,"The cottage was absolutely lovely and perfect for our family of 8 (including 2 young kids). We spent a fantastic few days touring the Barossa Valley wine region and the cottage was in a great location. Marijan met us upon arrival on the first day and gave us a great overview of the area and some very helpful tips. Throughout the stay, she was very accessible for any questions we had and the check out process was similarly seamless. We had a great experience and we would highly recommend staying in the place and look forward to revisiting in the future!"
17980547,722475775,2021-01-07,376572250,Donna,"We recently enjoyed a two night stay at Martinsell Cottage. Peter's welcome was warm and genuine and Marijan responded promptly to the few inquiries we had during our stay. Martinsell Cottage is a charming stone building that sits beautifully in its rustic environment.  And as you look further into the distance, the scenery really is lovely.  The sheep and alpacas add to the idyllic rural picture. The cottage is comfortable and the air-conditioner in the living area assured we were toasty warm in the unseasonably chilly summer weather.  We set up nibbles on the front porch (it's small space but a bit of a sun trap and quite sheltered from the wind - worth the effort) and spent a couple of restful hours enjoying wonderful local produce and wines, chatting and watching the animals quietly move about.  We principally used the cottage as a base to explore the local area.  Tanunda is a pretty half hour drive away.  So many place to see.  I can thoroughly recommend Gomersal Wines on Lyndoch Road (a lucky stop despite the premises normally being closed on Tuesdays - the host, Gaby is a delight) and Fino Seppeltsfield.  All in all a lovely stay."
17980547,723590673,2021-01-11,56457161,Amanda,Comfortable self contained cottage away from the big house with a lovely vista.  Peter and Marijan are very welcoming and friendly and happy for guests to wander in their lovely gardens.
17980547,724502339,2021-01-16,13047637,Miranda,Inviting and private. Homey and a great escape. Worked well for us as a young family. Accommodating owners.
17980547,725729127,2021-01-21,144060207,Angela,"Such a lovely old, historic place to relax and unwind. Marijane and Peter helped with local knowledge and showed us around the beautiful property."
17980547,729771131,2021-02-07,105776485,Sienna,"Peter and Marijan's place was definitely our pick of the bunch when staying in the Barossa region - with good reason! They had a beautiful historic cottage in a very convenient location to wineries and restaurants. There were lots of little touches that made it feel extra homely. The property itself was also lovely, a massive amount of land with alpaca and sheep that we loved. Our group of 4 agreed that we could've easily spent more time there. Marijan was very hospitable, lovely to talk to, and had so much excellent local knowledge. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quieter area to stay in whilst visiting the Barossa, without compromising on location."
17980547,735840974,2021-03-01,40358742,Lauren & Paul,Clean and basic. Perfect if you’re looking for isolation.

17980547,760015693,2021-05-19,6157401,Anna,We were lucky enough to stay when there were lots of lambs around so that was wonderful. It's a quiet place where you can easily head out into the bush for a walk. The fireplace was heavenly and the electric blanket kept us warm at night. A perfect place to recharge for a couple of days.
17980547,760839336,2021-05-22,327905478,Tony,"We really enjoyed our stay in this beautiful place, so close to everything yet it feels like a million miles from anywhere. A highlight was the old schoolhouse."

The fire in the lounge was just lovely and perfect for roasting marshmallows on a cold night. The two queen sized beds were comfortable with a range of pillow choices. The back room with the two bunk beds was comfy and a good size. It was nice that there were two bathrooms too."

We spent a glorious week going for long walks in the local area and exploring the Barossa region.  The whole property is around 77 acres and you will be surrounded by peace and tranquility, just the sounds of nature!  The cottage itself is very spacious with everything you could possibly need for a short or long stay.  The slow combustion stove is fantastic on a cool evening and the bath is wonderful for a long soak after walking in the hills.  Peter and Marijan are terrific  hosts and communication with them was smooth and efficient.  We would thoroughly recommend Peter and Marijan's listing to anyone seeking a unique experience on a large property with easy access to the Barossa area."

17980547,526339578942765049,2021-12-27,22869663,Claire,Lovely cottage for our family catch up. Had everything we needed.  We enjoyed the R & R and the kids loved the sheep wandering around. Note for an extended stay that grocery shopping is 20 minutes away. We had a lovely meal at the Williamstown Hotel for a change from the BBQ.  The cottage is not luxe but we didn’t need that & enjoyed our stay very much.
17980547,529247091358590023,2021-12-31,97693055,Preeti,Great hosts.  Marijan took time to explain the history behind the property.  It is great for families looking for some peaceful time.  Williamstown is just 7 km away with a great bakery.

18276899,166249614,2017-07-03,46810152,Daniel,"Where to start? The place was beautiful, cosy and had everything we need for a perfect long weekend. The fireplace was roaring by the time we got in, and the beds were super comfortable and warm. The kitchen was well stoked with some local produce and we loved our complimentary bottle of red.<br/><br/>The house itself is within walking distance of at least three fantastic wineries (Peter Lehman, Langmeil & Dave Franz) with Cynthia and Rolf's winery (Rolf Binder) only being a short drive up the road (be sure to also check them out!).<br/><br/>Rolf and Cynthia went above and beyond to show us a great time in the Borossa, with winery and dinner recommendations only ever being a text away.<br/><br/>Thanks again for an amazing long weekend, we are already planning our return."

The wine by the host was excellent , the food was well stocked and the kitchen has all amenities. The communication was great. You actually go back in time when you live there , would recommend for someone looking for that experience."

We only ever needed to travel a maximum of 12 minutes to visit the many wineries, produce markets, farms etc. in the area! The breakfast provisions provided were both generous and delicious. And the Rolf Binder winery is a must visit - great pizza, Shiraz, Reisling...! We will certainly be back. Thank you Cynthia and Rolf."

18276899,550573501,2019-10-19,3202311,Trevor,A brilliantly comfortable step back in time. A 1950s house with modern facilities retaining all the style of its time. Worth a major detour to enjoy this opportunity.
18276899,584331622,2019-12-29,100986742,Heath,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful home.

The breakfast provided was also extremely generous, all local produce which we loved. Would stay again!"

Very welcoming hosts, Great location, breakfast included and very clean and comfy home. Our little one was able to enjoy running around in the garden.

18276899,478429884540785893,2021-10-21,109200893,Jo,"Hanisch Haus is a beautiful cottage set in lovely gardens, providing a peaceful slice of paradise, yet close to all the Barossa has to offer. There’s so much to love; thoughtful touches, farm free eggs for breakfast, local jam and bread, vases with fresh cut roses, and much more. <br/><br/>The kitchen has all amenities, including modern items such as a coffee maker, but steeped with nostalgia, including an aga stove. The laundry boasts an old horse trough along side a modern washing machine. This all works well to blend the rich history of the area with modern conveniences. <br/><br/>There’s plenty of space and the bedrooms are comfortable with beautiful quality bedding. The cottage is clean and welcoming.  Communication with Cynthia was excellent, and she is a wonderful host.    There’s no shortage of things to do with several wineries in walking distance, and excellent restaurants and cafes in the main street. We are definitely looking forward to our next visit to Hanisch Haus."

18798879,249223142,2018-04-01,15615457,Cassandra,"This historic apartment is beautifully furnished and in an absolutely perfect location - a quiet street a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston.  <br/>The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed, including a Nespresso machine and thoughtful touches like Lindt chocolates. Mark replied to all messages quickly, check in was a breeze, and we loved the warm welcome from Mark's 3 small and friendly dogs each morning. We loved staying here and would definitely stay again next time we are in the Barossa. <br/>We were here for a wedding so didn't have a lot of time for exploring but would highly recommend the Barossa Farmers Market for breakfast on a Saturday."
18798879,330712327,2018-10-01,61475070,Denise,"1851 @ Hill House was such a wonderful experience.  From the minute we confirmed our booking, Mark was welcoming, attentive and so helpful.  From restaurant suggestions to offering to confirm bookings, nothing was too hard.  Check in was a breeze and we loved the attention we received from not only Mark, but his three gorgeous and friendly dogs.  1851 is a gorgeous and very cosy cottage, with so much history and character.  Mark has fitted out the cottage beautifully.  Tucked away in Angaston, we loved that it was only a short drive from the wine trail.  <br/>When Mark discovered that Riesling is my go-to wine, he immediately offered to organise a wine-tasting with RieslingFreak (a MUST DO if you're in Tanunda) and even organised transport to the cellar door.  <br/>Mark also recommended a meal at FermentAsian - another ""must do"".  As it was the long weekend, the degustation menu was on offer and wow - what an experience.  An extremely impressive wine list so Mark's advice to leave the car in Angaston was a good call!  <br/>It's worth noting that Angaston is much quieter than other towns in the Barossa so a car is essential and take note of opening hours.  We were there during a long weekend and a lot of places were closed entirely or early.<br/>A wonderful weekend... and we'll definitely be back!"

Quality linen both bed and bathroom. Comfortable bed, although queen size for those who may need a king. <br/>5 min walk to town. Angaston is a pretty town of course, not the bustling restaurant and shops choices like in Tanunda. That was perfectly fine for us.<br/>We got to meet Mark who is a friendly guy and easy to talk with. <br/>thanks for a lovely stay."

A very very quiet town with a supermarket 10mins drive away, you will love the simple layout of the house allowing couples of families to relax. <br/><br/>Perfect for a glass of wine on the patio watching the birds nestle in the trees. <br/><br/>Bring your own food and drinks to cook up a storm in a kitchen that has everything you need. <br/><br/><br/>The house is in the main street but some trucks are the only noise you’ll hear. 25mins to Barossa - such an easy drive. We loved it - I’m sure you will too!"

We particularly loved the extra special touches such as beautiful linen, great toiletries  and small pantry items to use such as oils and spices etc. My daughters loved the fact that there was a cupboard filled with puzzles, games and paper for drawing.  Mount Pleasant is nicely situated in the Barossa to explore many towns and enjoy the sanctuary of a quiet country town.  We would love to stay again sometime and make it to the farmers market held on a Saturday morning.  Thanks once again."

Having family over from Sydney and being able to show off what South Australia has to offer was incredible and to be able to do that from this gorgeous house was just the icing on top! Hospitality was outstanding, with milk, eggs and bacon awaiting us in the fridge on arrival too!  Couldn’t have asked for better and would 10000% recommend Maureen’s home to anyone else looking for a lovely getaway. "
19817750,280749072,2018-06-24,186724858,Chantelle,"Maureen's place is a stunning open living cottage house. The property has some stunning surroundings and the house it's self has been decked out in the best of brands for appliances, towels etc. the pictures certainly don't do the house justice. It has been the best property we have ever stayed at."
19817750,290116076,2018-07-14,159904293,Gulcan,"What a beautiful property in the quiet town of Mt Pleasant. Great for exploring the SA countryside: 20 mins to the Adelaide Hills and 30 mins to the Barossa Valley. Maureen is a great host, including spices, olive oil and any other essentials you need to cook up a storm in her gorgeous kitchen. Our kids loved the toys, dollhouse, sheep and alpacas. It kept them entertained for hours! The SA countryside in general is very family friendly. We will definitely be back!"

It was so spacious and relaxing. I hope we are able to come back and stay again. It was exactly what we needed after a busy few months.<br/><br/>We went on many long drives around the Barossa which was fabulous. It was also nice coming back to the charming cottage at the end of each day.<br/><br/>There is a brilliant local farmers market about a 5 minutes walk from the property every Saturday. We got there around 9am for an amazing cooked breakfast! We definitely recommend that.<br/><br/>Down the road there is a butchers, pharmacy, post office and a fabulous little Cafe with a general store attached. This is all walking distance from the cottage.<br/><br/>We came from abroad and didn’t have any data on our phones so we bought a pocket WiFi from the post office which worked really well.<br/><br/>Maureen’s place is completely charming and definitely a hidden gem."

It's the perfect place for a cozy weekend away in winter, I would love to come back in Spring when the garden is in full bloom and you can utilise the alfresco area for meals.

Its bloody fantastic, when they say luxury tent experience they certainly deliver, next level glamping. Kate our host was approachable, accomodating and puts on the best cheese platter and breakfast spread we've ever had in an airbnb. The tent in situated at the bottom of their property next to a little creek with views from your bed across the paddock. Cannot fault the experience. It was a memorable stay. Will be back!"

It is beautifully stunning, even down to the small details. Perfect in every way. Sandy the family dog came and visited us which was nice there is also sheep and two horses. (So make sure you take some carrots & apples as they love them). Star gazing on an evening is a must so quiet and totally dark."

The inside is outstanding and the bath is sublime! The views and the fire and wine, what more do you need for a relaxing get away! It’s right on the door step of the Barossa Valley! We had absolutely everything we could need! Kate is an awesome host, so kind and attentive! We had a great last night with the hosts! Honestly couldn’t ask for anything more! Toasting marshmallows in the campfire, watching the stars! The Tent is 10 stars! Highly recommend to anyone who wants a truest memorable experience! We had a fantastic time!!!"

The tent is stylish in decor and amenities with breath taking views. Which only got better at night when we turned on the fairy lights and little lanterns lit the way to the fire pit area. A wonderfully romantic, very private  unique place to stay.  <br/>Highly recommend it for a special occassion. Hard to beat!!"

The location is the perfect home base to explore all the Barossa has to offer, but you could just as happily spend all of your time at the property too.

The tent and the outdoor area were laid out with the most homely of touches, we loved the decor and the brekky in the morning. Whilst the tent is nicely heated inside, it would be good to bring warm clothes if you want to have dinner outside as it can get a bit chilly! <br/><br/>Thanks again Kate for such a delightful stay!"

Opening the canvas sides to be able to look out on the farm and animals was just breathtaking. The bathroom was superb with a lovely shower and the most decadent of baths - i recommend relaxing in a warm bath on a rainy day with a glass of local red. The kitchen amenities were also excellent, all you need for a gorgeous stay. Communication with Kate was easy, helpful and friendly. We cant wait to return."

The property is great  with friendly animals to pat and lovely little nooks to explore. The highlight for me was the glorious big bathtub with views across the property,  bath salts and bombs provided , very spoilt.  You will not be dissapointed, travel around to local wineries or just relax and soak up the ambience.  We will definitely be back thanks Kate for all the special touches that you dont normally recieve at a BnB. In love with Boongarie"

The horses were so friendly! Definitely buy apples of carrots from the market and spend some time feeding them. Pootawanga Wineries just across the way is some of the best wine I've had in South Australia - highly recommend booking a private tasting. <br/><br/>However, if you're stuck on what to do, just flick Kate a message. She has spot-on suggestions. Overall, one of the best weekends away we've ever had. Highly recommend staying here."

We felt like we did it all... feed the horses, bath overlooking the land, breakfast alfresco with the sheep, and wine under the stars.<br/><br/>It feels like your own little remote paradise, but beautifully furnished and with touches of hospitality that go above and beyond. (We did end up having some 40+ weather during our stay, so it got a bit hot of the second night with no breeze, but the fan and AC really helped.) We've already recommended to friends."
20002372,600479085,2020-02-01,321971563,Amanda,A wonderful luxury tent - definitely glamping (not camping). Beautiful little touches with breakfast supplies & wine on arrival. Would thoroughly recommend

The homemade bread and jam was delicious. Enjoyed walking around and appreciating the natural landscape. The luxury tent had everything you needed plus a beautiful tub to soak in, with bubbles and bath salt’s supplied. Kate provided great recommendations for activities to see and do. Highly recommend other’s to try Boongarrie luxury tent."

The thoughtfulness of setting everything  up, leaving breakfast food and a bottle of wine out and also giving us tips and info about the area was better then we could’ve asked for. 100% recommend staying here. Kate and Gary were amazing hosts, and I’ll definitely be back."

Everything at Boongarrie is set out beautifully, it is such a cosy place to stay. They have thought of all the extra little comforts, like the homemade bread, breakfast items and treats which made it extra special. Having the options to spend time in the tent or by the fire was fantastic, with everything ready to go from Kate and Garry made our stay so effortless. Prior to booking Kate offered so many suggestions of local eats and places to visit which meant we could plan our whole getaway and even invite family up for a day trip and lunch in the Barossa. Time well spent in a great part of South Australia!"

Everything has been carefully considered in this luxury tent, including thoughtful breakfast provisions (Garry's homemade bread is to die for), showering supplies, right down to prepared fire pit area.

20002372,496630131593268790,2021-11-16,145505792,Jemma,"Kate’s  place exceeded our expectations, the location is perfect and the accomodation has everything you could need and more. Kate left some beautiful touches such as freshly baked bread and a bottle of red wine which were so welcoming. The outdoor bath is divine and the view and scenery is breathtaking. We would book again in a heartbeat. Thank you so much for having us 💕"

20002372,510333193681950999,2021-12-04,420933591,Adam,Amazing location with lots to do. All the facilities you need to stay in and have a romantic and relaxing weekend. Only a short drive from some of the Barossa’s best wineries. The only downside is you will want to stay longer!
20002372,511816473288079146,2021-12-06,71634695,Emma,"This stay was absolutely wonderful. Very clean, kitchen was well equipped and it was just lovely. I would definitely come back and stay again."

20002372,518389806664644672,2021-12-16,435298106,Tim,"Amazing, this place is the dream! Loved tge home made bread, fresh eggs, and wonderful views of the farm from bed! We were thrilled."
20002372,521216238033155395,2021-12-19,58402229,Natalie,Kate’s luxury tent stay was incredible!! She has thought of everything in terms of small touches that make your stay comfortable. The outdoor bath was a highlight. Comfortable and warm in the tent. So peaceful on the property and loved having the animals close by and so many birds. Would 100% come and stay again :-)
20002372,523412544342173645,2021-12-22,290252680,James,"You won’t find a nicer place in the whole area, my wife and I have stayed at Boongarrie twice now with two years between stays and it was even better the second time.  <br/><br/>It’s an easy drive over into the Barossa proper, but if you’re anything like us you’ll just want to spend the time in this idyllic setting, enjoying the peace."
20002372,530719691982573821,2022-01-02,34229990,Ben,"Simply perfect. Even in searing temperatures with plenty of bugs it still felt like a luxury tent. Loved our bird, horse and sheep neighbours. A special place to stay in Barossa and I wouldn't hesitate to stay again. Thanks Kate!"
20002372,532098855038668261,2022-01-03,202426922,Keisha Williams And Ben,Boongarrie tent is certainly luxurious! The homemade bread and fresh eggs are a really nice touch that made for a yummy breakfast. The horse and sheep were super friendly and a great experience being able to have a pat and feed. Inside the tent the bed was very comfortable and the kitchenette very handy. The outdoor shower and bath that has recently been added was a beautiful touch to an already spectacular retreat. Would highly recommend booking a stay at the Boongarrie Luxury tent!
20002372,533530327482623187,2022-01-05,89812506,Michelle,"We loved our stay at Boongarrie.<br/>A lucky little find after we cancelled our interstate travel plans!<br/>So quiet and relaxing, all we heard were the  kookaburras, parrots, pet sheep and horse who was up for a pat as soon as we ventured in his direction.<br/>The outdoor bath and shower was amazing , we didn't even use the one indoors at all. Kate was a great host,who was more than happy to help with our query. Highly recommend for a peaceful time away."
20002372,535000441969299796,2022-01-07,388257524,Mandy,"This is a wonderful, private place for a romantic getaway. Absolutely loved it and would definitely stay again. Glamping at its best!"
20002372,536513212444362787,2022-01-10,249546307,Marnie,Boongarrie Luxury Tent is simply amazing in every way.  Everything has been thought about right down to simple touches.  A very relaxing stay with the wild life and farm animsls making it that extra special. The outdoor kitchen has been thought about and is so well equipped with everything you need. The baths (esp the outdoor one) make this tent very luxurious and special. To wake to the sound of the native birds  in a bed that feels like a floating cloud is the best way to start the day. Will definitely be returning.
20002372,541532126885632222,2022-01-16,389573826,Hannah,So gorgeous! <br/>Absolutely loved it and had the best time<br/>It’s amazing <br/>❤️
20002372,542234908163986918,2022-01-17,70267521,Melanie,"This luxury tent is absolutely divine! We wanted for nothing and have rarely, if ever, been so relaxed in our lives. We bathed (lots) inside and out, we cooked in the fantastic outdoor kitchen twice -  dinner was locally purchased steak, salad and wine, and a bacon, egg and homemade bread breakfast which was provided by the host. The view from inside and outside the tent could have been hand painted by Arthur Streeton but it was better because it was a moving landscape, with many birds to spot, trees swaying in the breeze, clouds and the moving moon, the sheep and horse. Magical night lights and a swing seat in a towering gum all added to the perfection of this Airbnb! We will be back!"
20002372,547356235193999739,2022-01-24,387214378,Hayley,Such an amazing little place for a romantic getaway.
20057093,218311570,2017-12-12,11404141,Philip,"Our time at Miriam's certainly more than lived up to expectations. The style, charm and cleanliness of the place were only exceeded by the little touches which made us feel more than welcome. We particularly enjoyed relaxing over a glass of wine and enjoying the beautiful garden. We would certainly return to Miriam's, given the opportunity. Philip and Chris Eldridge"
20057093,228478636,2018-01-20,50437579,Andy,"Alicia is a great host. Great to talk to, very fast respond and very helpful. Highly recomend Mirijams Cottage as it offers everything you need, incl BBQ Station. Many tks Alicia for everything, incl the Wine. It was wonderful. Pascale&Andy"

20057093,242741013,2018-03-13,26512644,Ned,"Miriam's cottage is a wonderful little house in a quiet street in Tanunda. It was clean and comfortable and there were nice touches such as a bottle of beautiful wine and generous breakfast supplies.<br/>Our pleasant experience was somewhat reduced by the lack of contact re entry details before our arrival and an old electric stove which only had two small rear plates working. That somewhat spoiled our breakfast experiences until we found an electric frypan hidden back under the sink. A drawer full of a jumble of kitchen implements, many duplicated or useless, is more reminiscent of a family beach shack.<br/>A manual re where things are located, garbage arrangements, etc would be really helpful. Wifi is really an essential these days.<br/>It seems that no one has had a really critical look at the house contents, customer relations etc for a long time"
20057093,287993126,2018-07-08,86476827,Emma,"We had a lovely family long weekend at Miriam’s Cottage! The home was clean, warm, comfortable & inviting with a lovely breakfast spread offered! Alicia was very accommodating with an easy check-in/out process. We would definitely stay again!"

20057093,333154383,2018-10-07,167877068,Krystine,"Miriam's is a charming cottage with beautiful gardens to wander through and enjoy. The cottage was spotless, beds comfy and lovely linens. Large lounge room and an enclosed room at the rear to relax & read. The kitchen has everything you need and plentiful and varied breakfast provisions were provided, fruit on the table and a lovely touch which was much appreciated was a bottle of wine with a cheese platter to welcome us which we enjoyed outside on the rear deck. We would love to stay again and will recommend to our friends as a great Barossa base, walking distance to Tanunda shopping & dining and central to the valley's lovely wineries."

The stone cottage is adorable with a lovely cottage garden at the rear. The area is extremely quiet so you'll get a great night's sleep. Breakfast provisions were in the fridge, as was a greatly appreciated bottle of wine. Alicia is a great host and quick to respond to communications. We'll stay again next time we're in the Barossa."

It was perfectly situated, both for exploring the local wineries and also within Tanunda itself, which is a gorgeous town with lots of beautiful eateries and shops.  The cottage had absolutely everything you could want for a short or long stay, with plenty of character and charm to boot.  The breakfast and cheese plates (featuring local products) was particularly special.  Thanks Alicia!  Hope to be back some time very soon."

The air-conditioning surprisingly is ducted and worked exceptionally well in the hot weather. The lovely character garden has lots of wildlife , with birds splashing in the birdbath in the early morning. The kitchen has all the implements and appliances you need  for cooking. Would definitely stay there again when in the Barossa."

The heating kept us warm as toast on a very chilly winter night. The fire pit was fantastic and a glass of wine while toasting marshmallows was a great way to spend a wintry evening. When the Weather warmed up the rear patio was a lovely spot to enjoy a BBQ overlooking the lush garden. The bedrooms are spacious and the kitchen is small but cosy and adequate for 4 guests   We loved our stay here and left regretfully

20079805,189800423,2017-09-03,98386375,Tonya,"This house/cottage was absolutely perfect for our weekend away! We were three couples, but could have easily had a fourth couple and no-one would have been on top of each other. It is beautiful inside with every detail considered through to bathrobes in all rooms. It is cozy, elegant and homely all in one. Suzie was an absolute pleasure during the lead up to our visit, and her response times were excellent. We were a 10-minute walk away from the closest winery and a maximum of 25 minutes' drive away from the furthest (that we wanted to visit). Loved it!"
20079805,202771194,2017-10-13,151185714,Richard,"Though we have traveled extensively for over 30 years this was our first Airbnb. Since my wife and I are traveling with our 21 year old son and his friend we felt that a house would be our best option. Overall it was an excellent stay.<br/>The location is a short walk into Lyndoch the first of several ""wine towns"" as one enters the Barossa Valley from Adelaide. There one finds a bakery and  several restaurants (we had good coffee and breakfast at The Table Cafe), a small grocery store (for serious grocery shopping much better off in Tanunda) and a gourmet meat market (great house smoked salmon). The first several of the valley wineries are within a kilometer or so.<br/>The four bedrooms are each quite unique and except for the one off the eating area have individual climate controls off the main system and are each decorated quite differently. The house is quite old but that is much of it's charm. There are many nice touches and features throughout such as two robes with each bedroom, a working fireplace (with plenty of wood) in the living room, dozens of movies, plenty of nice dishes and glasses, a propane barbeque (we did steaks one night). The master bath shower and jacuzzi style tub have a great view of the backyard and surrounding vineyards (though can draw the shades if needed). The backyard is pretty with the smell of citrus trees.<br/>There was a supply of Nespresso pods with milk and a frother so good coffee was at hand!<br/>Really nothing to complain about; overall cozy, plenty of room and a large bright kitchen when we needed to cook.<br/>Suzie supplied us with useful tips before we arranged. We had a minor issue and were able to reach Steve the manager and had it resolved in minutes!<br/>Highly recommended!"
20079805,207266427,2017-10-29,71210558,Liz,Beautiful cottage with gorgeous views....such a warm & relaxing space...🤗

20079805,214913835,2017-11-26,82417544,Prue,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It is absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail and all the little extras are fantastic, but it is the house itself that is just amazing. Suzie clearly has a passion and flair for interior decorating. We were 5 women on a 'girls' weekend and we when we entered the house we just were blown away by how beautifully it was decorated. And spotlessly clean. The rooms are huge, the 5 of us each had a large comfortable space and the living areas are also big and really welcoming. Great vibe to the house. Having 2 bathrooms was also good! Fresh crisp sheets, thick fluffy towels and bathrobes. Sitting on the back deck gazing at the lovely garden with the vineyards stretching behind was just what you want from a Barossa escape. Yet you have the convenience of a bakery and IGA in walking distance up the road. I will be telling everyone I know this is THE place to stay in the Barossa.  Was really convenient for everything we wanted to do there. Made our weekend away really special staying here,"
20079805,216443546,2017-12-03,110198397,Anna-Lisa,"Such a beautiful home, loved it"

20079805,230317104,2018-01-28,1016912,Stanley,"This lovely cottage was exactly as described and as appeared in pictures.  Lovely garden out the back.  Suzie was very responsive and sent through a list of things to do and places to visit as soon as the booking was confirmed.  Suzie was also very accommodating with check-in and check-out time.  We were there during a very hot weekend.  The air-conditioning was very powerful and cooled down the house very fast.  The kitchen was also stocked with all the necessary amenities.<br/><br/>I must say there isn't all that much in the town of Lyndoch, although it served its purpose as a base to discover the wineries in the Barossa Valley."
20079805,246696685,2018-03-26,118619193,Wendy,We travelled from Brisbane to the Barossa for a 60th Birthday weekend.  Suzie's place was perfect for the four couples with lots of space.  The house was full of the most amazing knick knacks. The outside area and surrounding gardens were beautiful overlooking the vineyards.  Everything we needed for our celebratory weekend.
20079805,253551832,2018-04-14,57568886,Nikola,"Great location,comfortable well presented cottage with fire place that made our evening vine and cheese plate unforgettable experience .We loved our stay in  the cottage and Barossa Valley."

20079805,422351361,2019-03-10,95067285,Sarah,Azalea Cedar-Rose is a charming little cottage and a wonderful base for anyone visiting the Barossa Valley. The cottage is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful homely feel about it. Sparkling clean. Our trip was a girls weekend away - we all live in various parts of the country and rarely get the chance to spend time together without partners and children around! We spent our evenings lounging on beanbags in the gorgeous gardens and enjoying the spectacular scenery each cheese and drinking wine in the lovely quiet of Lyndoch. Suzie was a wonderful host - very accommodating to our needs and so prompt in replying to any questions I had before and during the weekend. The cottage includes lots of hot tips for travellers and Suzie was also kind enough to offer lots of additional suggestions throughout the weekend. We are all already planning another trip for next year!
20079805,433590331,2019-04-07,72818727,Martin,The cracksin the wall just add more character to this gorgeous place.

20079805,484957566,2019-07-10,199904662,Johanna,"Azalea Cedar Rose is a beautifully appointed four bedroom cottage in Lyndoch, with a sun filled dining room at the back, looking out over a kitchen garden and rolling vineyards in the distance. The house is sparkling clean and each bedroom has its own unique style, from exotic and bold to pretty in pink. We stayed in July and the underfloor heating in the bathrooms were much appreciated along with the wood fire stove and central heating! The meticulous attention to detail was evident throughout the house, from amenities through to decorative finishes. We particularly loved the chalk board on the back of the toilet door with the itinerary of places to visit in the Barossa Valley! We enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend this gorgeous cottage as a rest stop."
20079805,496741631,2019-07-28,48432022,Dawn,"We stayed two nights at Suzie’s beautiful home. We arrived at night and were able to easily access the house and loved waking up to find the view from back of house over the vineyards. Quite amazing. The house has been finished beautifully with lots of lovely touches which fit in well with the Barossa. It was well located for easy access and the chalkboard list of where to go helped guide our visit. We enjoyed the breakfast, chocolates and port supplied. I would recommend Suzie’s house for a weekend away or a longer stay if you have the time."

It is driving distance to the bigger town but walking distance to a few local shops. Ideal for a big group. Would highly recommend.
20079805,525525228,2019-09-08,263333503,Pauline,Azalea Cedar Rose is such a delightful place to stay.  Myself and the other guests were enchanted from the minute we walked in and we thoroughly enjoyed everything about it.  We were 10 people in total and there was ample space for all of us.  The décor is lovely and so well thought out.  It is obvious that a lot of effort has been put into making this place special.  Suzie shared lots of her local knowledge with us which was very useful when deciding what to do while we were in the Barossa Valley.  She was also quick to answer all of our questions.  The breakfast provisions were generous and delicious.  It is fair to say that we weren't left wanting for anything.  I  highly recommend staying at Azalea Cedar Rose and hope to visit again one day in the future.
20079805,561692017,2019-11-09,57479991,Rosanne,The whole experience of working with Suzie from start to finish went beyond expectations.

20144446,198906852,2017-10-01,11079424,Megan,"Charming little cottage with fabulous shabby chic decor.  Lovely views from the backyard and a cosy feel inside, complete with fire place in the living room and large spa bath in the bathroom.  The kitchen has everything you need and the bedrooms were super comfy.  Only a short walk down the main street to the shops/cafes/restaurants and easy drive to all the main wineries."
20144446,206998365,2017-10-28,12712074,Cindy,"Jasmine's Cottage is in a tiny sleepy part of the Barossa, however it is very close to Tanunda and Nurioopta and Gawler is not far either. Sensational restaurants to try are Bistro 1918 in Tanunda and St Hugos Vineyard for a degustation lunch. Appellation at The  Louise is another fantastic restaurant but possibly more for a special occasion. Would also recommend Fino at Seppeltsfield for a more casual share plate experience. The Barossa for us is all about the joy of eating great food and the beautiful wines of course and this time was no different. Jasmine's cottage enhanced the experience as it is a charming little oasis to return to each day. Would definately recommend."
20144446,210009287,2017-11-07,42885493,Angela,We loved staying in this cosy shabby chic cottage. It was perfect for our weekend away to the explore Barossa Valley. Great info available in the cottage and some nice little extra touches. Lovely back garden to enjoy a pre-dinner glass of wine in the sunshine and a nice wood fire to keep things warm in the evening. Would definitely come and stay again. Thanks Suzie

But moreover, she so genuinely wanted us to have a good time!<br/>Her cottage is like a little piece of paradise and she has thought of everything!

We decided to travel from Melbourne the weekend of 42 degree heat. The house stayed really cool with its aircon. We had port and chocolates, coffee and biscuits, am amazing spa and the views onto the vineyards behind. The wineries were so close, the restaurants at the end of the street and a garden to die for. We'll be back!!"
20144446,728306067,2021-02-01,128508174,Danae,Gorgeous cottage with so many beautiful touches. A real treat to stay here!

Was cosy and made complete with the fire, Netflix and giant spa bath! We loved watching the sun go down over the vineyard with cups of tea, and then a glass of rosè by the fire (which seemed fitting with the decor!). Thanks again. 💞😌"

20144446,760498470,2021-05-21,344257406,Kathryn,"We enjoyed our stay at the cottage very much. The location is great. Walking distance to Lyndoch shops, cafe's, bakery and hotel for dinner. The backyard is such a winner. We enjoyed our morning coffee and after find of local wine while watching the sun highlight the vines and hills that surround. The warmth of the fire place was greatly enjoyed too. Quiet location. Great communication."

20175507,323551002,2018-09-16,74777422,Karinna,"Organisation was great, spaces were fine and clean. Air conditioning wasn’t great in one of the rooms. Decor is ok.. out of date but it is as per the pictures."

20524750,281507275,2018-06-25,27682125,Kylie,Wow! The Reserve is even better in real life than in the pictures. Superb location to visit the Barossa. Simone had great communication from day 1 and went over and above with the information provided as well as local hints of where to go and what to see. We didn’t want to leave
20524750,282987006,2018-06-29,3943946,Ellie,"The Reserve is the perfect accomodation for any group looking for a self-catered home with all the mod cons! Warm, inviting & gorgeous views out the back of the home, our group of 7 had a fantastic time staying here. Thanks to Jodie for her fantastic communication during our stay :)"
20524750,309844261,2018-08-19,135477359,Helen,Fabulous home and location! 
20524750,321668765,2018-09-11,44148984,Rachel,"A beautiful property with lovely furnishings and fittings, and in an ideal location to experience the Barossa. Highly recommend."
20524750,325500818,2018-09-20,34809863,Victoria,"We stayed with our family for two nights for our small wedding, which we held in the beautiful gardens. The Reserve was a warm and welcoming place and was so close to great wineries (literally on the same road as many of them) that we even had a chance to visit a few. The fire was going and keeping the place cozy for our arrival which was a really nice touch. The grounds were beautiful - nicer than the pictures and able to be fully enjoyed even in bad weather, through the glass windows at the back. We also really enjoyed making our own pizza and using the pizza oven the night before the wedding :) All necessary equipment was provided. We had hoped to have our wedding dinner outside and although the weather wasn’t kind to us, the glass conservatory/dining area made a beautiful alternative and was more than comfortable and big enough for us all. The host was happy to allow caterers to come in to prepare our meal, and helped us with various recommendations ahead of time. <br/>The host was extremely responsive to all queries leading up to our stay and promptly responded to an issue with the gas supply on the night of the wedding. Unfortunately the temporary fix for the gas meant that there wasn’t enough for hot water for all 11 guests to shower before leaving the next day, but my impression was that this was unusual and ultimately out of the hands of the hosts, who had arranged for the gas to be replaced early the next day, but the suppliers didn’t arrive. Other than this hiccup - which I’m guessing is very unusual - we had an amazing time at the Reserve and will actually be returning in December with friends which we are looking forward to. I would definitely recommend staying at the Reserve."
20524750,341801247,2018-10-27,64198680,Johnny,Beautifully situated in the heart of the Barossa. Amazing house/property with an equally friendly host - this is an ideal spot to visit wineries and/or just sit-back and gauze out overlooking the vineyards in our private retreat.<br/>The place is stylishly modern and accommodates up to 12 people comfortably (2 x on stowe-away beds) for a perfect escape. Facilities are ample and there’s even an option to hire a personal chef to utilise the outdoor wood fire oven. <br/><br/>Would highly recommend staying for a week.
20524750,361135302,2018-12-22,43474783,Katie,"Such a beautiful property with incredible views, gardens, access to the best wineries around and gloriously renovated. Booking was easy and Jodi, the property manager, provided exceptional service throughout. The owners even allowed us a late check-out with no extra charge. The beds were incredibly comfy and the kitchen easily catered for 9 of us self-catering on the first night. The only slight criticism was that the spa did not work. I'd planned the late checkout to give my guests (8 of them) time to enjoy the property and its amenities, which we were paying luxury prices for. However, despite one of the main reasons for booking the property being that there was a spa, it did not work. That being said, Jodi responded quickly, came out to the property (with a bottle of sparkles to apologise for the inconvenience) and attempted to fix it. Whilst she thought she had, unfortunately the spa continued not to work and we all vacated early."
20524750,528854776,2019-09-13,112238620,Frances,It was a beautiful and cozy place. Jodie got the fire going for us before we arrived as I texted that we were cold on Kangaroo Island. Very thoughtful of her. The grounds around the house was lovely and my girlfriends took plenty of pictures there. The location was fantastic as it was a short drive to all the places that we wanted to go.
20524750,537638587,2019-09-29,112772304,Craig,"Amazing place. The setting is perfect. I especially loved the lights in the trees. The info we received beforehand really helped us to make the most of our time. The house itself is gorgeous. Beautiful features, garden, bedrooms everything. It’s worth the spoil!!"
20524750,655014259,2020-08-22,177380872,Jacquelin,Great place. <br/>Would stay here again. <br/>Price of property could be a little more affordable. But we were over all happy.
20524750,705603018,2020-11-01,14031331,Emma,This space is more magical than the photos even suggest. The reserve is just gorgeous and an amazing winery just a stone throw away named Rolf Binder Wines - Highly recommend! We used the pizza oven and made the most of the gorgeous gardens. We will be back!
20524750,756297896,2021-05-09,7460523,Maria,"Unfortunately missed the mark. Property/ grounds were great but wasn’t luxury accommodation. We paid a lot and the house was missing a number of essential items (toilet paper, body wash etc). Spa wasn’t working."
20524750,392241610090554390,2021-06-25,27979434,Gary,Nice accommodation. Easy access to wineries. Grounds are beautiful. All the amenities needed are provided.
21481807,463211863,2019-06-03,211428184,Nicole,"Pinecone Ridge is a fabulous place to stay.  Cosy, comfortable and stylish.  Only a short drive from town, beautiful surroundings and we wished we could have stayed longer !"
21481807,467001836,2019-06-09,18697625,Maya,We can not recommend Anne’s place enough. The house has absolutely everything you need and more and the view of the paddock was stunning. We were a group of 8 adults and had a wonderful weekend in Angaston for a friend’s 30th.
21481807,471068280,2019-06-16,1629066,Angela,"We were a group of 6 friends that stayed at Anne's over the weekend and had the most amazing time in this home. The photos do not do the place justice, not only does it feel extremely homely, but a lot of thought and details have gone into the furnishings. All of your needed amenities were provided, plus additional little touches that were an added nicety such as board games, basic cooking amenities, soaps etc. <br/><br/>We will 100% come back to stay here again!"
21481807,474230305,2019-06-23,100727498,Jeremy,"Of all my stays with Airbnb, this was the best. Anne's attentiveness was evident right from the moment I booked. The home and location are superb. Just a glorious place to stay and enjoy and Anne was on top of everything and her attention to detail was fantastic. A highly recommended option for the Barossa Valley."
21481807,478353971,2019-06-30,31884657,Donna,"Pinecone Ridge really has it all, wineries at your doorstep, a friendly and accommodating host and little touches that made the stay so much more enjoyable, the bread kit was a hit as was the wine, thank you!  5 stars from me and my guests!"
21481807,482698511,2019-07-06,36606675,Scott,"Pinecone Ridge is simply amazing. It’s tucked away from the Main Street is Angaston which is perfect and provides a home away from home. Waking up to a sunrise, birds chirping and a stunning view was the perfect way to get the day started. Anne’s property has everything you need, you literally don’t need to leave, except maybe to grab some of the amazing wines from the local vineyards. Comfy beds, couches, well equipped kitchen, toasty fireplace, stacks of LEGO to keep your creative mind going and very thoughtful attention to detail across the entire place! This is the type of place that you’ll want to come back to time and time again, and we definitely will be back! <br/>Thanks for everything Anne. We loved your suggestions and your place! See you again soon!!!"
21481807,488369455,2019-07-15,96639433,Adam,"We stayed here , with two families and had an amazing time (4 adults, 3 kids) The place is perfect for that . We were there in the absolute depths of winter but stayed incredibly warm with cozy fires and a few reds of course. There’s also plenty for the kids to do with games, LEGO and amazing outdoor spaces . Anne as our host was amazingly attentive. Highly recommend staying here."
21481807,501601721,2019-08-04,6675491,Eldad,"This is a gorgeous place, situated in a quiet location but close to everything. <br/><br/>A place to come back and relax after wine tasting or stay the while day while drinking, eating and enjoying the view.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
21481807,507729640,2019-08-12,56091930,Robyn,"Absolutely gorgeous - views, ambience, amenities. Hosts have tbought if absolutely everything. Thank you so much, hope to return we just loved our stay."
21481807,517963948,2019-08-26,27514985,Andrew,This place is stunning. If you are considering it as potential stay place then don't waste time. If it is free then book it. No point writing anything else. It's wonderful
21481807,529468597,2019-09-15,278620681,Jane,A relaxing and well equipped getaway. Not a far drive from all the Barossa has to offer!
21481807,533609792,2019-09-22,34245933,Toby,"The house is very well presented and is in a great location. You can walk into town, but have country views. <br/>The kitchen facilities are excellent and the wood burning stove warms things up quickly."
21481807,537557295,2019-09-28,13650986,Brant,"Great place for anyone looking to escape the city, with loads of space on the property and gorgeous views. <br/><br/>On a practical note, the rooms are filled with large, comfortable beds, but lack hanging space for clothes - so travel light and ditch the formal wear."
21481807,543967449,2019-10-09,180426849,Alison,"A lovely property for our family to stay at. Great local tips from owners and great communication, beautiful outdoor and indoor spaces. Plenty of toys for our four and five year old to play with. We also had fun riding the billy cart down the hills.  Beautiful having breakfast watching the kangaroos hopping over the property. I would stay here again."
21481807,551093484,2019-10-19,3720557,Jillian,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Anne's. She has thought of everything we needed and more! The space is beautifully decorated. We enjoyed waking up to freshly baked bread, the property, and all the local tips on things to do and see. Can not recommend Anne's place highly enough."
21481807,555690526,2019-10-27,125315518,Jess,"This is the perfect house, it has everything you could need and more. It’s on a beautiful 16 acre property, overlooking vineyards and countryside. It has an outdoor fire pit to enjoy the sunset and view. The beds are super comfy and everything feels new. We all had great sleeps! The main bedroom is quite large with its own en-suite. Both showers have rain shower heads with great pressure and heat. We got stuck into a puzzle there is a wide selection ruin of them to choose from along with so many games, dvds and books. Full cooking facilities with things like oil and salt n pepper and some other goodies. It is such a great location for wine tasting and exploring. We have stayed in tununda before but this was much much better. We booked a maxi taxi for the day and they had no troubles picking us up it’s a great way to wine taste without the hassle of a proper tour. We got to choose where and when we went."
21481807,559368785,2019-11-03,28179597,Emily,We had a fantastic time in Anne’s place. The place was in the most beautiful position with stunning views over the valley.

21481807,610661387,2020-02-24,322055,Lana,This house was a dream. Sunlit rooms and well decorated spaces made our stay here unforgettable. The beds were so comfortable! The kitchen well stocked and had everything a cook would ever want. Best toys and books for our kids. we found ourselves bringing wine and food back to the house rather than going to the restaurants. Anne was a great host - superb communication and recommendations tailored to our family. I cannot recommend this house enough. Thank you!
21481807,616165816,2020-03-09,67509346,Mary-Anne,"The home was perfect! Great location, beautiful space with absolutely everything we needed.

We enjoyed the reading material too. Great personal touches and thoughtful message. <br/>Thank you Anne, being able to check in early and out a little later was a bonus we weren’t expecting. A wonderful weekend being able to enjoy the Barossa region and come home to a comfortable home. Highly recommend this accommodation."

21481807,626280821,2020-05-25,51349575,Tom,A wonderful space for couples or families. Everything about the house speaks of quality and class. It feels like living in family home and not a holiday house. <br/><br/>On top of this the views and surroundings are spectacular and provide ultimate privacy and peace. <br/><br/>Will definitely be back.
21481807,655048432,2020-08-23,33281665,Leah,"My sister's an I had an awesome weekend at Pinecone Ridge! It was so clean, warm and cosy. It is such a beautiful spot! Would recommend!"

Anne has thought of absolutely everything and the only problem we had was not being able to stay longer!<br/><br/>Pinecone Ridge is such a beautiful, relaxing place to stay. It's decked out with everything you need and there's lots of thoughtful homely touches. There's stacks of good quality books, games, puzzles and dvds. We have 2 young kids and Anne left out boxes of toys, Lego and books for them.<br/><br/>The house is spotlessly clean. The bed linens and towels are beautiful quality. The combustion fire was warm and toasty. The sunsets from up the top of the property are stunning. Netflix and Nespresso were appreciated!<br/><br/>We will absolutely return!"
21481807,665927699,2020-09-20,342005869,Kylie,"Stunning location in the hinterland of Angaston surrounded by trees and beautiful garden.

Really lovely place to stay and generous host, definitely recommend."
21481807,670019588,2020-10-02,25522332,Justin,"We had the most amazing time at pinecone ridge. We were fortunate to experience misty rain and clear skies and both were magical. <br/><br/>Incredible views and sunsets along with several kangaroo sightings.<br/><br/>The house has everything, games books and magazines along with Netflix to keep you entertained but little things like electric blankets and firewood were a nice touch.<br/><br/>We really appreciated the effort of the host to make our stay special and we’d love to stay at pinecone ridge again in the future."
21481807,671395534,2020-10-04,252711760,Eleni,"We loved our stay here. Anne had a little welcome sign on the counter with a bottle of wine for us on arrival which was a cute touch. The house has a homely feel, plenty of space for the kids to run around on the property, and a view to die for. I would recommend this stay to anyone with kids."

21481807,703130932,2020-10-24,206375170,Cassie,"Pinecone Ridge is very comfortable and exceptionally well equipped. Just far enough out of town to enjoy the peace and quiet, but only a short drive to many wonderful restaurants and cellar doors. We had a great stay and being only just over an hours drive from Adelaide, would love to visit again. Highly recommend!"
21481807,704736699,2020-10-29,181208148,Lauren,An absolutely fantastic Barossa experience at Pinecone Ridge. From the moment you enter the drive expectations are exceeded by this beautiful accomodation.
21481807,705570432,2020-10-31,29002985,Denise,"Stayed here in October, lovely thoughtful touches. We loved the pre set fire, great communication, the wine and of course the very awesome set of instructions on setting the bread maker so that we woke up to warm fresh bread. The electric blankets were great and we loved all the quirky light fittings. Very well appointed bnb, picnic basket, champagne cooler in freezer etc. Loved our stay."
21481807,707270439,2020-11-07,34428215,David,One of the best Airbnbs we have every stayed at around the world. The place has absolutely everything you would want or need to have. Immaculately clean and very comfortable. Anne was very accommodating as we made a couple of requests to make it easier for our 3 year old son. Will definitely come back!
21481807,712097238,2020-11-29,15104435,Kate,"Just came home from a long weekend relaxing at Pinecone Ridge. The house is delightful and to make things even better it is amazingly well set up. I have a “travel box” that I bring along to every AirBnB because most have blunt knives, and a veggie peeler, scissors and can openers etc are not always there. My box stayed tightly sealed for the whole weekend because Anne has thought of and provided everything and it all works. The property is magnificent and we loved watching the storm roll in on Saturday night. I’d love to come back in winter to enjoy nights by the fire. <br/>Fantastic house. Amazing communication from Anne and it all added to the perfect weekend away. Thanks Anne."
21481807,715656746,2020-12-14,43151628,Yan Dan,"A beautifully appointed house, exactly as the pictures show PLUS a lot more! A great place for a quiet, homely yet luxurious holiday for a romantic getaway or a family with children. Kitchen, bedrooms, laundry, bathrooms, pristine clean and  fully equipped with everything we needed and things that we hadn't even anticipated needing. We will definitely be back to stay again! Thank you Anne."

Not to mention the amazing views across the valley, this hidden gem was also only a short walk into the Main Street of Angaston.

We arrived to a welcome message, complimentary wine and a bread kit for making fresh bread, as well as one of the most well-appointed kitchens we have seen in an AirBnB.

21636564,213754765,2017-11-23,3753624,Gen,"We've travelled the world, stayed in many Airbnb houses and even host our own and I have to say that this was one of the most spectacular places we have stayed. Pembury Cottage in the beautiful Barossa Valley was idyllic...a picturesque historic cottage on the main street of pretty Angaston, walking distance to lovely coffee shops, a yummy bakery, restaurants, lot's of wineries close by (I could go (Website hidden by Airbnb) in the hub of wine/food heaven!) and the home itself was perfection. Kate and Jonathan have really thought of everything, from the quality linen, exquisite (and abundant) breakfast provisions, thoughtful touches that gave you the sense of being in an upmarket, comfortable country home and the rooms were light and warm (we were there when it was cool, but I noticed there were air conditioners, too). Bathrooms sparkling and kitchen like something out of Vogue (we didn't cook in it...too busy drinking wine and eating Italian at Casa Carboni down the road). We went as a couple but would definitely come back with friends as it sleeps 6. Great value and highly recommended!"
21636564,216046711,2017-12-03,160501291,Michael,We very much enjoyed staying in Kate and Jonathan's spacious and tastefully decorated cottage and have no hestitations recommending it to others. The cottage is just a short walk from all the town's shops and eateries and Angaston itself is just a few minutes drive from many Barossa vineyards and the much busier and larger town of Tanunda.

Parking is easy and it’s ideal for families groups. Kate and Jonathan have obviously gone to a huge effort to make the place comfy & welcoming. They went the extra mile and left breakfast and all those things you need on arrival aka. Milk, coffee tea. All the beds are amazingly comfy and huge. <br/>Anyone looking for a place that is ideally located in the Barossa should should choose this place."

Perfectly positioned a short stroll from everything in Angaston the home has 3 fantastic bedrooms, was clean, had a few thoughtful extras in the kitchen and fridge and suited us very well.

Jonathan and Kate have established a beautiful b&b which is dog friendly!!  Angaston is a small town but it is pretty and quiet which allowed us to have a very relaxing holiday. <br/>Barossa Valley is a spectacular part of the world - wine country at its best. We will return to the cottage and the Barossa!"

The house was very clean with comfortable King size beds and Jonathan & Kate have added some nice touches in this beautiful Cottage which made our stay even more special.

We certainly will be back.

Walking distance to quaint little village of Angaston, which has some lovely restaurants.  However with this Airbnb it is also possible to cook a wonderful meal of your own as it supplies all the utensils you could need to do this.  The special touches that the hosts provide are also amazing.  The photos that you see is exactly as is in person, beautiful! Thank you Kate and Jonathon for opening up your home for others to enjoy.

Incredibly comfortable, amazing beds, well stocked kitchen and a roaring fire.<br/><br/>Jonathan responded to our message on Day 2 and dropped off more firewood, which was fantastic and very helpful. It’s a great base for the Barossa and Eden Valleys and I would pick Angaston any day over the other Barossa towns. The cottage isn’t cheap but it is well well worth it. Look forward to coming back again in the future."

We loved the location, right in the Main Street of Angaston. <br/>It was just immaculate and had the perfect spaces for our group of 6. The beds were huge and so comfortable & linen spotless. <br/>The air conditioning heat pumps in all rooms were a bonus with temperatures 45degrees on one of the day’s we were there.<br/>A fantastic wee village to stay in while visiting the Barossa, wouldn’t consider  staying anywhere else. Angaston has the perfect quaint feel of being in the Barossa that we were looking for. We even drove to the Clare valley for the day, only an hour away and it was sensational.<br/>We didn’t cook while we were at the cottage as there were pubs and restaurants just down the road 3min walk. There were all the bits in the pantry left for visitors to use if they did cook.<br/>We even discovered the local gym who invited us in one morning for only $10p/p. Clair was the gym manager. Fabulous lady. Awesome facilities also.<br/>Breakfast cereals, milk and a welcome fresh loaf of bread was a grateful bonus.<br/>I would highly recommend you staying at Pembury Cottage to anyone wishing to have a perfect space in a stunning piece of South Australia. Only 1hr from Adelaide CBD.<br/>Thank you for your Barossa hospitality."

Just one trivial thing we noticed was that there was no sugar and oil in the pantry and due to it being Easter weekend and all stores closed, we had to do without it. Other than that everything was perfect about the house and we loved the combination of both modern and antique touches in the house."

21884875,470116108,2019-06-16,39902119,Barbara,"Very spacious Airbnb with great kitchen and 2 living areas which was great. The ducted heating was awesome. Location impeccable.<br/><br/>The not so good things: small couches in each living area. The house fits 6 people, but 4 of us struggled to fit in on of the couches. A couple of chairs or another 2 seater in the living room would have been great.<br/><br/>The bed in the room at the back of the house was horrendous!! I ended up sleeping on the couch which was much more comfortable.<br/><br/>The place had a feel of stinginess about it - e.g. only 1 toilet paper roll in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen and only 1 tea towel, very few coffee pods (lucky we brought our own!!!), only 1 bedside table in each of the spare rooms (not master bedroom), no bedside lamps, very scratchy old towels. It’s really not hard to invest a small amount in some nice finishing touches to leave a much better impression!<br/><br/>Overall it was ok for a short stay."

Kitchen was stocked with plenty of cockery and utensils, didn't have any issues finding anything. <br/>Master bedroom was the biggest room with lots of wardrobe space. Beds were a bit firmer than we're used to but I find that with most places I stay at. <br/>Home was in a quiet neighbourhood and walking distance to a few wineries on para road and the Tanunda Bakery. <br/>Overall very happy with our stay and would stay again."

22294732,238790703,2018-02-26,164355261,Christopher,"The Hutch Hilton was the perfect getaway for our family vacation in the Barossa.  John and Jan went out of their way in welcoming us and showing us around the farm.  The rooms are neat and clean each with an ensuite bathroom and shower.  The common living area is well equipped with the kitchen necessities to prepare your own meals and enjoy each others company al fresco.  The vintage cellar door is rustic and charming filled with local farm prepared jams, jellies, and chutneys, not to mention their incredible wines.  Guests are able to buy local farm products to enjoy like their incredible lamb that we enjoyed.  Our hosts went to the trouble of supplying us with wonderful farm fresh eggs, local bacon, bread and milk, which was a wonderful treat. This historic setting is a true gem and anyone visiting is fortunate enough that the Angas family shares it with the public.  We can't say enough about this wonderful property and delightful hosts."
22294732,242450100,2018-03-12,175923517,Karen,"A wonderful setting - beautiful views, wonderful trees, fresh air and unique decor. Jan and John's hospitality was outstanding - could not have asked for more. Each of the four couples had an amazing long weekend - we were sad to leave."
22294732,249243037,2018-04-02,6451100,Antony,"Honestly, we didn't know what to expect when we booked - but the location was suitable for three couples who wanted to explore the Barossa. But our serendipitous booking turned out to be so much more than that.<br/><br/>John and Jan were delightful hosts - warm, welcoming, highly knowledgeable and always looking to help you with advice. The working farm has been in their family for many generations, and John gave us a tour of the property (stunning by the way) before a wine tasting of what they make on-site (some of the best we tried all weekend!). We were even fortunate enough to partake in a grape pressing for the next seasons wine bottling!<br/><br/>The living space/kitchen is an outdoor/open plan arrangement, but really added something special to our stay. And the occasional visit of the two farm dogs was always very welcome!<br/><br/>Without a doubt, we will be returning here in the years to come.<br/>Thanks for an amazing weekend Jan and John!"
22294732,261142432,2018-05-06,17131826,Julie And Dugald,"Hutton Vale is a wonderful Barossa experience. The farm is beautiful with views over vineyards and paddocks filled with grazing sheep. The farm is just like a setting out of Country Style ! Grape vines trailing over rough stone walls,rusty sculptures surprising visitors everywhere you look. The accommodation is very comfortable with lovely bed linen, heating, electric blankets, fresh flowers and clean adequate ensuite bathrooms. Every evening we enjoyed a roaring wood fire  while relaxing in our ""Glamping"" kitchen/lounge shed. The sun streamed in every morning to make this area a cheery place for the breakfast gathering.<br/>Our hosts were so hospitable and welcoming and there were many thoughtful touches around the place to make us feel special and well looked after.  Our evening lamb roast came from Hutton Vale and we also enjoyed a magnificent wine tasting afternoon on the property.<br/>If you have a group of friends that all get along and love red wine ,log fires and relaxed country living I can highly recommend Hutton Vale for a stay."

22294732,317216305,2018-09-02,200709880,Jackie,"Jan's place is a home away from home!<br/>That comfy feeling you get when you sit by an open fire, or gather around a table to share a meal are waiting for you at this fabulous place.<br/>Beautiful views, majestic gums, a place to relax unwind, a place to share with friends or family.<br/>Jan and John are excellent hosts, we felt special, nothing was too much trouble!<br/>Hutton Vale Farm is a great place to connect with your surroundings, experience our beautiful country side and be part of something truly special."
22294732,331909720,2018-10-04,65302758,Minh,our family went away for two days just to get away for the school holidays.

22294732,333121204,2018-10-07,213292123,Andrew,"Guests are free to roam a country property, both old-style and diverse in nature. We really felt relaxed, and free to come and go as we pleased. Lazing in the rustic lounge space with the log fire and games with the kids, no devices, local produce and a bottle of Barossa wine was a wonderful taste of a life once lived. Thanks Jan and John"

The farm was beautiful and so lovely with  a fire at night to sit by and a full kitchen to be self sufficient. Location was also excellent with a short drive into town and easy location to the wineries of the Barossa. Would absolutely stay again!
22294732,442964751,2019-04-25,161051346,Danny,John and Jan were inspiring hosts! Their insights and knowledge of the Barossa were so interesting.

Jan and John made us feel extremely welcome and their knowledge and passion for their  farm and community are evident. Be sure to have a wine tasting with John - an experience in itself. The venue is rustic, but exactly as described, and a wonderful place for a relaxed getaway. Can’t wait for our next visit."

22294732,521450653,2019-09-01,80666032,Stephanie,"Jan & John’s farmstay will not disappoint - rustic elegance at its absolute finest. The whole experience was exactly what we were looking for in an escape from the big city. Waking up to sheep grazing in the field outside the bedroom door and seeing kangaroos at sunset was very special. The family dogs Alfie & Mac also made us feel like part of the family. Extremely warm, friendly dogs who were always nearby and ready for a pat or play (huge bonus for dog lovers like us!). The main kitchen/dining/living area is fit with everything you could need and is perfect for dinner parties by the fire. Making time to visit the Hutton Vale cellar (located right near the accomodation) for wine tasting is a must - beautiful wines which we enjoyed during our stay. Jan & John went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning our return."

22294732,616162854,2020-03-09,2091462,David,This was the most amazing and unique experience we had in the Barossa/Eden Valley.  Must do's are to do a wine tasting and tour and to buy some home grown lamb for dinner. <br/><br/>The wine tasting and tour is intensely intimate and you get a real taste of the history and the realities of farming and growing wine grapes. As the family tells you their story you can't help but feel completely immersed in it.  <br/><br/>It will be a challenge to find another place that delivers the same level of hospitality and warmth that we experienced.
22294732,626907210,2020-05-31,4129823,Arnold,This place provides a very unique and relaxing atmosphere! <br/>The hosts are very responding and careful to details and communication.  <br/>And I wish I was still there by the fire!

This was a once in a life time experience that we will always remember. They also allowed us to check out later which gave us a few extra hours to enjoy this beautiful space. All the the special touches made our experience so enjoyable and we cannot wait to return. Thank you so much!"
22294732,640343344,2020-07-20,68355916,Jenni,We had such a great time at Hutton Vale farm! The accommodation is so quaint and rustic. The out buildings are lovely to wander around with a wine in hand. Be sure to order a lamb roast to cook and do the wine tasting with John.

22604785,744803072,2021-04-02,4552217,Rebecca,"Highly recommend! Gordon met us for check in and shared the property’s history and showed us around which was a lovely personal touch. Huge space with attention to detail - Heather has provided clear instructions and local tips. Thoughtful touches such as fresh coffee beans and grinder, coffee pod machine, breakfast provisions, toiletries, fluffy towels and a very comfy bed! A great location to explore the Barossa."

22604785,753859519,2021-05-02,185424051,Ly,"Lovely hosts and home. A comfortable home away from home for anyone wanting to visit the area. It's obviously not as modern as what is popular now, but the elegant and historic characteristics are what makes this place memorable."
22604785,754495427,2021-05-02,227194656,Steven,Such an amazing place to stay and our hosts were outstanding! We will be back for sure!!!
22604785,755992044,2021-05-08,3914416,Dalila,"Heather and Gordon’s place is a lovely period house. It’s conveniently located to explore the area, short distance to many wineries and the neighbourhood is quiet and quaint.<br/><br/>We loved meeting Gordon upon check-in and learning about the building’s history. He also gave us some useful local tips.<br/><br/>Heather’s thoughtful touches around the house made our stay even more special. The house has everything you could possibly need, and more. So comfortable, super clean and even smelt incredible.<br/><br/>We wish we could have stayed longer, one night just wasn’t enough!<br/><br/>Thanks again :)"
22604785,756326769,2021-05-09,394467474,Paul,"Great little 2 bedroom place with everything you will need as a B&B, just be aware that there is two beds. Therefore, not recommended for a family of 4, with two kids.<br/><br/>Had a great night there and the hostess will pass on some interesting history about the building."
22604785,758596359,2021-05-16,160393501,Renae,Thank you so much to the lovely hosts Heather and Gordon we absolutely loved our stay. <br/>All the added touches were very unexpected. <br/>Such a beautiful place to stay and easy start to the Barossa vineyards. <br/>Wish we could have stayed for longer....

22604785,389364356683717879,2021-06-21,25916881,Jennifer,"Truly beautiful accommodation with lots of fascinating treasures to look at in the house, as well as the historical side which Gordon showed us on arrival. It has everything you could need, especially in the very well equipped kitchen. Loads of books and DVD's if you want to stay indoors. Immaculately clean. The back patio was delightful in the sun, and the high fences gave privacy as well as protection from any breeze. So many things around Lyndoch to see and visit - no need to go too far afield. The Lord Lyndoch is within walking distance, and we thoroughly enjoyed our meal there. <br/>A special thanks to Heather for coming to our rescue when ""someone"" managed to lock the house and leave the keys inside!!!"

Heather is a great host, responds quickly to questions with great local knowledge, will meet you on arrival with a quick tour of the property and is readily available if there are any concerns. Absolutely seamless stay"
22604785,490085326178308289,2021-11-07,375237040,Fiona,Heather was amazing to deal with and her communication was excellent.<br/>We booked this as a 50th birthday surprise for our friends and they loved their stay.

22636387,362211506,2018-12-25,67128083,Anthea,Wow ! Martinsell manor was incredible! Peter & Marijan were fantastic hosts and so helpful to all our needs. We had the most amazing week and look forward to coming back to stay again hopefully in the next few years. The property and grounds were just beautiful! Definitely recommend Martinsell Manor to anyone wanting to stay in the Barossa region.
22636387,408251704,2019-02-03,111689336,Emily,"AMAZING! Peter and Marijan were great hosts, so welcoming and helpful! the manor was so beautiful and we were honored to be able to stay here, it has been lovingly restored to a high quality. It really takes you back in time through a wonderful building with so much heritage. walking up the stairs from the pool made you feel like a princess.<br/>Thank you again and we will be back"
22636387,422371030,2019-03-11,226795254,Andrew,"We stayed at the Martinsell Manor for our 10year Anniversary.<br/><br/>Marijan and Peter have worked hard to restore the lower level to its former glory. <br/>They've done a wonderful job keeping true to history - from the beautiful rugs to the beds to the decor. <br/>Amazing effort - it really shows.<br/><br/>Its a wonderful place to stay - quiet, relaxing and private. <br/>A pool all to yourself for the hot days, a garden and near by pathways to go for a stroll and lovely soft grass to have some fun on. <br/><br/>We stayed in the Gold/White room. Restored and decorated beautifully - very large, with a large TV AND King size bed to match.<br/>The bed and sheets were extremely comfortable.<br/><br/>Marijan and Peter were the perfect hosts - ensuring we had everything we needed. <br/>They supplied the little things that normal places don't such as toothbrushes and toothpaste - and as well as adequate toiletries.<br/><br/>One highlight to our stay was they provided us with fresh fruits from their garden and Marijan's delicious plum jam! (As well as other items to eat/drink)<br/>Its these little things that make going somewhere enjoyable and it really did help aid in our relaxation.<br/><br/>Thanks again Marijan and Peter for making our 10 Year Anniversary memorable!"
22636387,487316749,2019-07-14,45124734,Tamara,"There is no denying that this is a stunning property. The gold room was gorgeous, well appointed and everything you would expect from a manor house. The second room unfortunately paled in comparison, with a literally a tv  the size of a laptop screen and electric blanket that was a single size and only warmed one side of the bed (I was freezing and Mum was like a hot water bottle ha ha). <br/><br/>The main living space lacked ANY form of heating and we found ourselves utterly  freezing  in literally sub zero  temperatures. We were forced to eat and huddling around a heater in the main bedroom...not what you would expect from a property that charged over $1,200 for a weekend (I mean who wants to eat dinner in a semi circle around a heater  in a bedroom????)<br/><br/>Breakfast was scarce and there was a distinct sense of a lack of generosity about the place. As a long time Airbnb user, I’m used to small thoughtful touches   rather than 3 tiny packets of cereal for breakfast for a group. I’ve stayed in properties for $120 a night and they were so consumer focused, as well as places $2k a night which were sensational (thorngrove manor for example) <br/><br/>The property is grand and stunning, but it’s not decked out for winter unless you intend to wear snow gear.... to BED...I’m not even kidding! ( the pool is covered so you won’t get the photos you see on the air bnb page etc). In spring/summer months I’m sure it would be magical. We informed our hosts we decided to find alternative accomodation for the second night we paid for due to the sheer freezing temperatures in the home-it was utterly inhabitable. We weren’t offered a refund, rather we were told if we wanted to visit again they would heat the home. I think they need a lesson in customer service. As a business owner I would never treat my consumers that way-that’s not how you treat someone spending that amount of money. <br/><br/>There is no wifi codes provided so expect to not able to contact the outside world during your stay. I couldn’t receive  texts, check my work emails and there was nothing in the info books around how to access it. <br/><br/>I think this place could be magical, it just needs a passionate manager who understands customer service, who is generous and genuinely wants their customers to enjoy the experience. <br/><br/>It’s hard to determine whether or not to recommend. The building is lovely, it’s just not particularly comfortable. I think there are other manor houses who really understand the customer, are passionate, generous and decent, I don’t think this place is it. It’s not about the asthmatics alone. To be fair, it’s about how you utilise the property and how it makes you feel. My rating? 2/5 they need to lift their game and not focus entirely on profit. I’d rather pay an extra $200 a stay for those little touches to include those who care about the customer experience. I hope this is a realistic wake up call  to these guys. It’s a competitive (Website hidden by Airbnb) better!!! People will return because of the experience you created, not because your MO  is income generation. We should have been provided a refund for a second night after raising our issues you directly. . That would have been the right thing...but these people don’t do the right thing, they put them and thier bottom line first....and do we really want to support businesses like that? I think not, choose elsewhere until they learn the art of decency and hospitality."
22636387,506613429,2019-08-11,19208849,Vivien,"We spent a very special weekend at this property and enjoyed the luxurious gold room in the manor, which is very private with a separate entrance. The furnishings in the room are in Georgian style with quality throughout. Also the bed is very comfortable with a high quality mattress. The old blends with the new as there is a flat screen TV, wi-fi access and heating. We also enjoyed the electric blanket which was working perfectly. The property has a beautiful large swimming pool set amongst majestic trees and pretty gardens with pathways. We enjoyed a tour of the property with a vineyard, sheep, llamas and chickens. Breakfast is provided in a modern kitchenette off the lounge area and is self service. There are tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge for personal use.<br/><br/>We enjoyed touring the wineries and eating in the Barossa as there is so much to see in the nearby vicinity. Our experience was very positive with such warm and friendly hosts. We would certainly recommend this accommodation."
22636387,530560963,2019-09-16,267653725,Brynn,Absolutely stunning views and a great location for our trip!!
22636387,585625604,2020-01-01,95190913,Kelley,"My husband and I had the most amazing stay with our little daughter. It was definately a trip to remember ! <br/><br/>We enjoyed walking around the property, playing in the pool, cooking dinner on the bbq and relaxing in the amazing house. <br/><br/>We used the lawn games and had so much fun family time together. <br/><br/>The best parts were the privacy on the property and views ! <br/><br/>We also were gifted with a bottle of wine from the owners vineyard on new years eve. <br/><br/>Highly recommend  !"
22636387,588672957,2020-01-04,49752081,Georgia,"We had an amazing time at Martinsell Manor, the house and surrounding gardens are stunning. The rooms are so grand and luxurious, Peter and Marijan have done a wonderful job renovating. They were excellent hosts, offering so much knowledge on the property and area. We had such a relaxing trip, highly recommend!!"
22636387,720660313,2021-01-02,99464633,Holly,"We had a lovely few days here over New Year's Eve (spending quite a lot of the time in the swimming pool)! The area is beautiful, with nice walks nearby and further afield; the building is very lovely; there's clearly a lot of good wineries and restaurants within a 20 minute drive or so, though we mostly didn't venture far away as there were so many spaces outdoors in particular to sit around and read or look at the wonderful views over fields."
22636387,722263497,2021-01-05,140824718,Areebah,"Lovely accomodation surrounded by beautifully kept gardens. Highlights were the pool, great amount of amenities (breakfast, snacks, cooking essentials and toiletries) and antique style interiors. Thank you for all your help and effort you put into making the space beautiful!"
22636387,745824798,2021-04-04,33019907,Kirsten & Morten,"Peter & Marijan’s place was absolute perfection. <br/><br/>They have thought of everything from beautiful decor to a generously stocked kitchen complete with eggs fresh from their chickens! It is clear from the moment you arrive that they have taken a huge amount of care and pride in creating a truly spectacular stay for their guests. <br/><br/>The location was ideal, close to everything but still entirely secluded once you are on the property and the ammenities on property would certainly be enough to entertain you for a whole weekend. You can lounge by the salt water pool, play lawn games, feed the alpacas and enjoy a glass of wine from their vineyard. <br/><br/>Highly recommend."
22636387,746947737,2021-04-09,6070973,Daniel,"Peter and Marijan,<br/><br/>Thank you so much for the amazing stay at Martinsell Manor, we had such a lovely experience in the Barossa made even more special and exciting at the manor.<br/><br/>The Gold room was large and spacious, with the cosiest bed and electric blanket for the colder nights. The small touches made us feel so welcomed as well, such as bathroom amenities, snacks, water, even eggs from Marijan’s chickens!<br/><br/>We thoroughly enjoyed our walks around the property but didn’t get a chance to swim in the pool. We’ll have to come back next time!<br/><br/>Thanks again<br/><br/>Dan and Gwen"
22636387,749665757,2021-04-18,31066801,Dainis,Lovely manor in a beautiful location. Manor had history and old world charm. Fantastic examples of older trees on extensive property. Very attentive hosts who were eager to make stay enjoyable ... which it was!
22636387,756326717,2021-05-09,67709409,Robert,"This property is, in one word, magnificent. Marijan and Peter are the most marvellous hosts: caring, generous, thoughtful, but unobtrusive. Their property is a mix of historic charm and luxurious amenity. We walked a great deal during our stay and we were so impressed by their care of the land as much as their flawless renovation of this historic manor. <br/><br/>The home was ultra comfortable, warm and homely, despite being located in a historic manor. The beds were like sleeping in clouds and the linen was super high quality. The property felt like some luxe inner city home but set in the middle of a vineyard and country farm; the ultimate country getaway. <br/><br/>I have read another’s review of this property. It is utter rubbish. Our stay was absolutely the opposite of what was asserted. We have travelled very extensively domestically and internationally, and could not have been happier. We stayed here a week and very happily would have stayed another week.<br/><br/>If you want a ‘real’ experience of the Barossa, this is it. We cannot wait to return!"
22636387,758586233,2021-05-16,168052670,Michelle,"Beautiful property, I’ll never forget the gorgeous little lambs. Lovely rooms. Marijan was very welcoming and kind."
22636387,763959602,2021-05-30,39791696,Brenan,"Had a wonderful stay at this beautiful property. Marijan was more than helpful, and very welcoming. We had everything we needed and more! It was fun to walk around, to explore the grounds, and to see the sheep and alpacas!"
22636387,388700874271415818,2021-06-20,128832659,Nk,"The Martinsell Manor is gem, one of the best kept secrets of the Barossa. My wife and I have been fortunate enough to travel the World and we can honestly say this place ranks very highly in our books of exquisite locations to holiday and lucky for us it’s in our backyard being Adelaide locals. We absolutely loved our stay at the Manor. Peter and Marijan have done a fantastic job in renovating this magnificent historical home. The rooms are splendid, architecturally marvelous, very clean and as someone said in another review the bed is indeed like sleeping in clouds, super comfy and warm. Marijan and Peter are such wonderful hosts; the kitchen and fridge was well stocked we hardly even got through half of the goodies, very quiet and non-intrusive. The peace and tranquility of the surroundings is to die for and refreshing. There is so much to do in close proximity of the Manor; wineries, amazing restaurants, tourist attractions etc couldn’t recommend it more, you just have to try it out."
22636387,464763839325690465,2021-10-03,424805326,Anthony,"A truly grand mansion,set in stunning grounds in one of the most beautiful parts of the Adelaide hills. A wonderful place to stay."
22636387,510404454319618358,2021-12-05,91580138,Craig,"Martinsell Manor is in a beautiful location surrounded by wonderfull gardens and lovely views of the vineyards. The Manor is beautifully furnished, very private and extremely comfortable. Peter and Marjian were very discreet allowing us to enjoy the Manor as though we were the only people there. They also provided lots of little extras such as fresh eggs, juice and bread. We loved our stay."
22636387,530644517075228450,2022-01-01,423628708,Michael,"Myself and two friends stayed at Peter and Marijan's home in between Christmas and New Years' whilst travelling around South Australia and it was a highlight of our two-week trip. The home is beautiful and exactly as per the listing, as are the grounds and the swimming pool. Both Peter and Marijan are incredibly welcoming hosts and couldn't be more pleasant, even driving us back to our car on New Year's Day. However, at the same time, you wouldn't even know they were there, the downstairs accommodation is totally private. I highly recommend booking this home when in the Barossa Valley!"
22794701,275418425,2018-06-11,187045775,Alicia,Loved staying at this cottage! Everything was so comfortable and clean. It is obvious that Deb has put a lot of time and thought into making sure that the place is “just right”. From the supplies in the kitchen to the way each room was set up - you really felt like a valued house guest. We started each morning with a walk through the videyards and enjoyed spotting kangaroos and other local wildlife - stunning! Steve was great too and nothing was too much trouble. Definitely make sure you visit their cellar door if you are there on a weekend - the wine and cheese platter were fantastic.
22794701,477196813,2019-06-27,173766543,Liz,Such a beautiful home within an amazing setting. Every little detail exceptional x

22794701,760841335,2021-05-22,257305325,Jasmine,"Everything was wonderful.  Would recommend highly, just check when the tastings are available before you stay. Extra lovely touches throughout the accommodation and very personable hosts."
22794701,770315645,2021-06-14,99037563,Andrew,"This place was absolutely fantastic! Cosy, warm and a perfect base for a lovely wine weekend! The property had everything you could want and need including a bbq and a fire pit for late night marshmallows! I couldn’t recommend this place highly enough and the hosts were so accommodating. If you come across this place I’d go right ahead and book it!"

22855141,244032146,2018-03-18,158637810,Kirsty,"Our family of four stayed at Sally’s place for 6 nights and had a really fantastic time there. Staying at a working vineyard, especially during harvest time, was a fascinating experience. Sally and Martin were wonderful hosts, they made us feel very welcome. We were able to walk around the vineyard, watch the harvest, feed the rescued kangaroos (and the geese and peacock), we borrowed bikes from them, enjoyed a complimentary bottle of wine from the vineyard, were given lots of tips on what to do in the area and very much enjoyed Sally’s homemade cookies and crisps and the chickens freshly laid eggs. <br/><br/>The house overlooks rolling hills of the vineyard and has a lovely view framed by the garden and lots of native trees; we loved just sitting out on the deck and taking in the scenery and listening to the birds. The house has lots of character with artwork and thoughtful touches including fresh flowers. It was spotlessly clean; we had lots of space; the kitchen was suitably equipped for the several meals that we cooked there, the condiments were appreciated, plus the fridge was stocked with milk, butter and some local goodies on our arrival. Overall we really enjoyed our time there and would love to come back for another stay if we make it back to Australia some day. Thanks Sally and Martin for a wonderful time."
22855141,251390048,2018-04-08,174139890,Paul,"Whistler Vineyard Retreat is an absolutely fantastic accommodation in the heart of the Barossa Valley. We spent two days with Sally and Martin and cannot recommend their accommodation highly enough! <br/>From the minute Sally and Martin welcomed us to their retreat, the kind gesture  of a complimentary bottle of whistler wine and platter waiting for us on arrival and the perfect location to enjoy a glass of wine on the back verandah and watch the sun set over the vineyards we knew this was special and felt right at home. We loved every moment we spent at Whistler's Retreat, and hope to return again soon. Thank you Sally and Martin, just perfect."
22855141,260772870,2018-05-05,51856360,David,"We really enjoyed our stay with Sally and Martin.  The setting is beautiful facing out to vineyards, in a quiet winegrowing area that makes for a serene stay with quiet, dark evenings that highlight all the stars you haven’t seen since you were a child.  Their friendly menagerie wandered about the property; their gorgeous peacock would periodically check in on us, and their friendly dogs and cat would occasionally come by to greet us as well.  Of course there are geese, the orphaned kangaroos they care for near their cellar door, and the chickens that provide your breakfast eggs as well.   We appreciated the fresh flowers, snacks, breakfast goodies, local recommendations, and their sincere and friendly hospitality.  And when we reported a minor problem one evening, Sally and Martin immediately fixed it.    Internet worked perfectly well even while accessing some data-heavy spreadsheets for work.  Over a decade ago we stayed at another nearby property where we had sole use of a guesthouse, and we really preferred our stay here, as we had all the privacy we wanted while having access to the recommendations and company of 30+ year locals when desired.  Don’t wait,....book this guestwing now!"
22855141,269100410,2018-05-27,156099057,Ashish,"The experience was nothing short of extraordinary. A perfect getaway in the middle of the beautiful Barossa Valley. Starting with an amazing, very warm host [Sally] to the most scenic/beautiful property with deeply thought out amenities and, what deserves the most mention, a collection of adorable pets [incl baby kangaroos and peacocks!]. A true gem! "

22855141,308166995,2018-08-16,56788834,Patsy,"One word: Superb. From the welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine, recommendations on local spots to visit, to just sitting and gazing at the wind playing in the trees; this was  heaven!  Gorgeous accommodation with thoughtful and interesting touches.  We had three days and could easily have enjoyed more.  A fabulous property. "
22855141,309857947,2018-08-19,64007556,Meghan,"The Whistler is one of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed in! We spent the evening by a roaring fire and Sally's incredibly well stocked kitchen, complementary bottle of wine produced on site and heated floors kept us extremely warm and happy. The location couldn't have been better for wine tasting and in summer, taking a bike ride around the vineyards (bikes offered on site), would be lovely. Sally's hospitality could not be topped and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to explore the Barossa."
22855141,313691704,2018-08-26,46049706,Louise,Very clean and cared for rooms and property in a private vineyard setting.<br/>Sally was an excellent host that provided us with everything we could possibly need including a bottle of their own lable of premium Shiraz on arrival together with a local cheese board.<br/>We particularly enjoyed sitting around the fire in their garden at night sharing stories and a glass or two of wine.<br/><br/>

22855141,338548326,2018-10-19,47058579,Pia,"From the very first message to Sally I knew I had picked a great place to stay! On our arrival she was so welcoming and offered us so much great advice about where to go and what to see, not to mention the lovely welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine. It was also all the other touches, home made cookies, crackers and fresh eggs from the chooks in the back garden. We enjoyed a glass of wine on the back balcony overlooking the vineyard as the sun set, magical!! The accommodation is spotlessly clean and the beds are super comfy! Location is perfect and we were central to so many amazing vineyards and restaurants as well as the new Gin Distillery just up the road. We also enjoyed a wine tasting at the Whistler cellar door, beautiful setting on the lawns. All in all this place is the only place anyone should stay at when visiting the Barossa. Sally makes you feel so welcome as soon as you meet her and is happy to share her knowledge and love for the Barossa. We will definitely come back and have already recommended it to our friends."
22855141,352148897,2018-11-24,51261670,Jane,"Sally was a wonderful host. The personal touches (like home baked cookies, farm fresh eggs,  fruit) make you feel at home from the first moment. The home is located in the vineyard and is very serene, with the resident farm animals wandering about creating a very relaxed and familiar atmosphere. I highly recommend Sally’s place!"
22855141,356645410,2018-12-09,8296391,Anthony,"Amazing location to venture across the Barossa Valley. The host knows the area well and recommendations been great! This range from where to eat, drink, grocery etc . And she always response fast.<br/><br/>The stay been great with a nice kitchen to wipe up meals after Barossa Farmers Market, and having it on the patio, facing the sunset over the vineyard. Mornings are a delight to have the resident peacock going by, chickens giving freshly laid eggs and geese going by. <br/><br/>The wines from Whistler packs surprises. Do spend time at their cellar doors, while children could while their time at the playground.<br/><br/>Lovely host and place."
22855141,405893638,2019-01-27,232483896,Outsa,"It was absolutly amazing. I can't say enough about how beautiful the place was. Sally was such a lovely host and had everything we could have needed ready for us. If you love piece and quiet, animals, pizza and wine then this is the place for you."

Sally was a welcoming host , from the plate of local produce on arrival , home baked snacks and fresh eggs to providing great information about the area . Sally provides the right balance between attentiveness and being unobtrusive.  We had a fabulous weekend hanging out at the vineyard as well as getting out and about . Highly recommended!"
22855141,443362203,2019-04-25,33465985,Aisha And Lea,This was a beautiful little place to stay. Really loved watching the geese walking about the lawns and spying Roger the resident peacock.  Not only were the hosts very accommodating but we were welcomed with a lovely bottle of white wine and a cheese platter. Just a beautiful way to start a mini holiday in the Barossa. I would definitely recommend this lovely piece of paradise to anyone.
22855141,445237080,2019-04-29,178754917,Marcia,"This was a peaceful relaxing place to stay. The setting was really beautiful. The apartment was stylish and well appointed. The wine, the platter and the eggs on arrival were really nice and very tasty. There were so many little extras such as condiments, home baked biscuits and books on the book shelf. We highly recommend this as a really lovely place to escape the city hustle and bustle. It was a good central location for sampling what the delights of the Barossa. Thank you for having us. :-)"

22855141,540690443,2019-10-04,155080644,Clay,"This place is in a beautiful location at a fantastic winery. Great walks around the vineyard, dams and animal enclosure were a great start and end to our day. The hosts are super helpful and very responsive to any requests.<br/>The cottage is very well equipped with everything you could need and the hammock was an especially nice touch.<br/>Thanks for the use of the push bikes and the local tips and advice. Can’t wait to come back."
22855141,546730072,2019-10-14,11647836,Craig,"Amazing! I could stay here for a full week!<br/>There is so many things to do at Whistler from a walk around the vineyard to play equipment (for kids), roo enclosure and of course the great wine!<br/>Wonderful hospitality, local suggestions and relaxing surrounds."
22855141,560819550,2019-11-07,97892030,Susan,"Sally's place is impeccable.  It is beautifully presented, charming with many personal touches.  Surrounded by a gorgeous garden and sited in a vineyard it is the perfect place to stay in the Barossa.  Sally herself is friendly and hospitable and has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and to provide expert information about the area."
22855141,564930277,2019-11-16,46307010,Tamie,"Amazing hospitality, delicious fresh eggs for breakfast, home made biscuits, platter & wine on arrival and a gorgous, sparkling clean place with all you could need. There was even a luxurious deep bath. Sally gave us loads of local tips and was always available when needed. The winery has delicious wines and a green open space for relaxing while tasting and plenty for the kids to do too.  Everyone we met there was friendly and helpful, we were also lucky enough to be there for one of their friday night food truck and wine nights.<br/>The view from the place is of the vines and it is very easy to get to many wineries inc Seppeltsfield and Maggie Beers restaurant. I highly recommend staying here, it is a treat! Thank you Sally for ensuring our weekend was so memorable."
22855141,628409757,2020-06-08,186022405,Helen,"The perfect quiet getaway in the country. If you are after a private bonfire, with short walks, in a beautiful  location this is the place. Sally was generous in her supply of little extras. The underground floor heating during cold winter nights was fantastic."
22855141,630907351,2020-06-21,78197864,Tiana,"We had a lovely stay during a rainy weekend. Cozy, warm and everything you need! Sally was lovely, we will be back for longer next time!"

Beautiful location overlooking the vines, awesome bath, great walking and cycling track and close to Tanunda."
22855141,636639664,2020-07-11,229890919,Michael,"We absolutely loved our stay at Whistler Wines, and are sure you will too, whether you are traveling with kids or without. Sally was extremely proactive with communications, and we couldn't have received a warmer welcome at checkin from Ellen. The location, just off Seppeltsfield Road, is arguably one of the best positions in the Barossa - you're just a stone's throw from Torbreck, Two Hands wines and Seppeltsfield, and a short drive from Nuriootpa and Angaston. The retreat was a warm, welcoming space, comfortably furnished and with amazing amenities (+1 for underfloor heating and a deep soaking bath overlooking the vineyards!). Our children especially loved meeting the friendly dog, Winnie, the geese and the rescue kangaroos down by the cellar door. Fresh eggs are provided from the well-fed hens on site and there are other amenities like freshly baked biscuits, great coffee and even Sal's home made tomato sauce. As our stay was mid-winter, we didn't have much of an opportunity to enjoy the outdoor area (including hammock!), but this would be divine once spring rolls around. Highly recommended!"
22855141,640346746,2020-07-20,323500698,Chris,"Fabulous welcome, accommodation and location. We loved walking with the dogs. A perfect break with the cellar door to walk to with fantastic wines to try. Sally is very generous leaving us a lovely bottle of wine to welcome us, a cheese platter, homemade crackers, I’d love the recipe please, and biscuits. Could not have asked for more and we’ll be back."
22855141,648510468,2020-08-09,15123164,Brian,"A perfect place for a long weekend, even in winter! A warm welcome from Ellen on one of coldest days. Lovely food provision - cheese platter, eggs, biscuits, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, butter and a bottle of Whistler wine. <br/><br/>It’s a great location for many other wineries, and just two minute drive to Appellation for dinner. <br/><br/>The kitchen is well equipped, we cooked a dinner with local produce from the farmers market.<br/><br/>The bedding is comfortable, soft and fluffy towels, and nice bath tub overlooking the wineyard. <br/><br/>The underfloor heating is just perfect for winter, a mild and effective heating. It was a little wet to have an outdoor fire that weekend but it would be perfect setting on other cold days.<br/><br/>Absolutely love the geese! They are just gorgeous little things. (Not that little actually)<br/><br/>Highly recommended and we’d love to return on other occasions."
22855141,658087935,2020-08-30,357518801,Emily,"A truly fabulous place to stay!! Great location, atmosphere, full of comforts and personality. We’ll definitely be back again soon. Thank you!"
22855141,665928751,2020-09-20,49898601,Bodhi,"This is a beautiful piece of paradise in the heart of the Barossa. Sally was a kind and thoughtful host and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. Her extra sweet touches, like fresh flower bouquets, rice packs to warm the bed, fresh eggs from the chickens and a delicious welcome platter and a bottle of delicious Whistler Wines are just a few of the fine touches. The beautiful scenery amongst the vines and all the animals made this a truly unique experience that I would recommend for anyone. I know we will be back."

22855141,703446347,2020-10-25,335167056,Martyn,"We had a great stay here with our adult son and his partner. The house was very comfortable (the underfloor heating was a bonus as the weather became very cold) and the beds were also comfy. Sally provided little welcoming extras such as heatbags for the beds, homemade soaps, homemade biscuits, fresh eggs, a cheese platter and bottle of wine. There were also some basic but very useful provisions left in the cupboards (salt, pepper, oil, gladwrap, etc) which were great to have as we cooked a couple of meals. The view over the vines was very peaceful and the chooks, geese and roos provided some entertainment! The central location made accessing wineries and restaurants in the Barossa easy. Would definitely stay here again!"
22855141,707269865,2020-11-07,264196428,Matthew,"Such a great space and location. Guests are only metres from the vineyard with ample places outside to socialise and soak it all in. The attention to detail was outstanding with a welcome platter, homemade Anzac bikkies (yum), fresh eggs and cut flowers. Sally and Martin were fantastic hosts, and we’re looking forward to returning sometime in the future."
22855141,736905414,2021-03-07,130067590,Gary,"All round 5 Star stay we had. The BnB was stunning and super easy to get around to all of Tanunda’s best offerings.<br/><br/>Lovely personal touches like homemade biscuits and a welcome bottle of wine were wonderful, and topped off with a late check out. An all round lovely stay !"
22855141,743437780,2021-03-29,28473907,Nigel,"Overlooking the vineyard and beautiful gardens this is a great stay in the best area in the Barossa! Quiet and peaceful with great hosts, just the spot to rest and relax for2 to 4 guests. Highly recommended."
22855141,745879546,2021-04-05,3961925,Hannah,"Our family of four stayed here over Easter and couldn’t recommend it highly enough! Perched on top of a hill, with a short walk through the vines to the cellar door, the location was perfect. Our kids loved the wandering geese and dogs. Sally is quick to respond to any requests and a great local guide. We would happily return again soon!"
22855141,749659287,2021-04-18,6314985,Chris,"This place is all that’s great about AirBNB … a delightful,comfortable space that has a connection with the owners … and a friendly, thoughtful and generous host! This was our second stay and we WILL be back. The guesthouse has everything you’d expect and then Sally’s delightful extras - fresh eggs from the chooks, Anzac biscuits and even a bottle of wine. It’s private, but with the benefit of being connected to the vineyard. A great base from which to explore the Barossa!"
22855141,751667891,2021-04-25,202894722,Chris,"I booked Whistler for my Wife and sister and after a couple of cancellations due to Covid a year or so ago they finally got a chance to go, they both can not speak more highly of the accommodation and the hospitality by Sally, from the wine and cheese platter on arrival to the beautiful scenery of the vineyards where the house they stayed in is situated the views were amazing.<br/>You can enjoy wine tasting of quality wine 100 mts away in Whistler cellar door which had kangaroos and was a big hit for the kids that were around, there are numbers other wineries within walking distance.<br/>All in all an amazing experience with lovely hosts 5 stars."
22855141,754971184,2021-05-04,283077817,Paddy,"Thanks Sally and Martin. We really enjoyed our stay in the Barossa, and that Whistler is so central to wineries, restaurants and towns in the area. Your suggested day plans are great and make it easy to have a great day without having to think about it too much! We loved that one of your gorgeous dogs took us on our walk around the vineyard on Sunday morning, and the sounds and sights of all your other farm animals and rescue kangaroos. Thanks again! Paddy and Angela."
22855141,756320394,2021-05-09,53723058,Joe,"We had a perfect long weekend staying here, after a boring conference in Adelaide.  Beautiful location, amazing hosts, thoughtful details - we couldn’t recommend this place more."

22855141,390760875306615761,2021-06-22,210055479,Alexis,Such a great place for a getaway. The home has everything you would need - Sally has thought of everything. There are stunning views from the large windows and there is a cosy verandah to just sit and chill. The underfloor heating was amazing for the cold weather and it was great having access to a bathtub. We also enjoyed a walk around the property to see the wildlife and vines and a visit to the cellar door is a must!
22855141,393720600372982218,2021-06-27,142876546,Kasey,"10/10 stay...this place is the best!!!! So so homely and Sally is a wonderful host who goes above and beyond! The winery itself is fantastic too, the wines produced here are top shelf! But that is just the start, the setting is amazing and animals just complete the place. We travelled with our two young daughters who both had a fabulous time and therefore it does suit families however a romantic relaxing getaway would even be better...maybe we can make it back for that one day 😉. The master bedroom looks onto the vineyard, you could not expect to wake up to a better view....anywhere!!! Highly recommend...we will be back 😍"
22855141,398847037500564473,2021-07-04,238006759,Jordan,"Beautiful location, with loads of lovely little thoughtful additions throughout the accomodation. The underfloor heating is absolutely wonderful in the cold weather, too!"
22855141,403810263889024419,2021-07-10,12819092,Tamaryn,"Thank you again for the wonderful stay. The warmth and homeliness of the place is hard to beat and we were very grateful to be able to experience the tranquillity (even with our 2 young girls) for a very relaxing and comfortable weekend away. <br/>The location is the best we have experienced in the Barossa and for someone who is a bit of a linen and towel ""snob"" - it was pure heaven to have such high quality and beautiful items to use over the weekend. The extras were so generous and we all thoroughly enjoyed every minute of the trip!"

22855141,469817809191870758,2021-10-10,22185379,Deanna,"We had a wonderful stay at the Whistler Vineyard Retreat. The property is beautiful and tranquil - a perfect place to switch off and unwind. Sally was a wonderful host - welcoming, helpful and a great communicator."
22855141,484991392818972563,2021-10-30,27138384,Penny,"Whistler Vineyard Retreat was a wonderful find. I stayed with 2 other girlfriends , but it is flexible to accommodate 2 couples or a family of 4. Inclusions were very generous with a  Barrossa cheese platter, fresh Barrossa coffee,  a bottle of their Whistler Wine and many more home made goodies making this the best valued in the region.  Underfloor heating made the place super welcoming after coming home from a day of lunching and gin tasting . Unfortunately we were too full to drag ourselves to the firepit , looking forward to enjoying that on our next stay. Location is perfect  for exploring the valley , you could walk to the Seppeltsfield Gin Distillery up the road or meander down the driveway  and enjoy the on site cellar door! Sally was warm and welcoming making communication a breeze. Would highly recommend this place on your next stay to the Barrossa."
22869313,246173997,2018-03-25,3267039,Shireen,Very clean and comfortable cottage in a quiet village. The provisions were excellent and the linens and bedrooms very comfortable. The owner is very helpful and accommodating. There is no garden so if you have kids this is something to bear in mind. The restaurants and cellar doors are around 15 minutes drive (some may be closer).
22869313,323624171,2018-09-16,29606552,Scott,Every fine detail is catered for and all add up to 5 star quality accommodation. Such a beautiful and romantic little get away spot!

22869313,449560671,2019-05-07,5481192,Renée,"This place raises the Air BnB standard. Staying here is a must for a Barossa Valley visit. Mel has thought of everything, including freshly picked roses, bath salts for the bath, amazing food and drink supply, candles, stocked firewood. I had no trouble communicating with Mel and she is extremely accommodating."
22869313,451003144,2019-05-10,33018208,David,Beautifully appointed cottage in the middle of town. The breakfast and food and wine supplied was from local producers and excellent quality. Everything you could need a great place to stay
22869313,452772993,2019-05-14,21901214,Sasha,This place is beyond expectations. Every single touch had been carefully thought about and many surprises. We loved our stay and couldn’t recommend it more. Thankyou Mel for allowing us to stay. We will remember it forever
22869313,470102022,2019-06-16,216596579,Mikki,"This is such a charming cottage in the Barossa Valley area.  Every vineyard is a short drive away.  Mel the owner has Queen's Cottage decorated in such a lovely way from sheets, towels and even the bed covers are 5 star.  The cottage is filled with supplies from chocolates, wine, breakast provisions, and many more.  The fire is warm and cozy with heaps of candles and wood is supplied for your stay.  Mel even supplies bath salt for the lovely claw tub.  Thank you Mel for the lovely birthday celebration I was able to give to my husband on our weekend trip to the lovely Barossa."
22869313,495968721,2019-07-27,31482441,Alex,Could not recommend Queen’s cottage more highly. Mel goes above and beyond to make the stay as memorable as possible. 10/10.

22869313,626892558,2020-05-31,90955127,Debra,"Like the other 5-star reviews, we were absolutely delighted with ALL that we found at Mel's Queens Cottage. The space is thoughtfully decorated and is warm and welcoming. There were gourmet delights for us from local businesses. Breakfast provisions were very welcomed and generous. The beds are firm and comfortable, with electric blankets (which was very appreciated during our stay as the nights were cold!). Having said that, the wood fire certainly warmed the living area beautifully and added a lovely ambience. The under floor heating in the laundry and bathroom was a welcome treat for bare feet and kept that end of the house gently warm. If you can't be bothered lighting the fire, there were 2 reverse cycle air conditioners that quickly warmed the living area, bedrooms and kitchen.<br/>Despite being on the main road, we barely heard any traffic and being a country town, there really wasn't any traffic to be seen anyway.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay in the Barossa and will be back to enjoy this fabulous find again."
22869313,628097352,2020-06-07,133996334,Brooke,"My stay at Mel’s was amazing. The home itself was lovely, but it was the little touches that really made my time there really nice. <br/><br/>There were fresh muffins waiting for us, as well as some lovely chocolates and port by the fireplace (which was already made up and ready for us to light!)<br/><br/>Mel provided a gorgeous spread for breakfast - fresh eggs, bacon, tomato, mushrooms, yogurt, fresh fruit, croissants, as well as some cereals. There was milk and orange juice as well and lots of tea and coffee options. <br/><br/>The house was in the perfect spot to walk to the local pubs for dinner, not even a two minute walk. <br/><br/>My weekend at Mel’s was amazing, so relaxing, I didn’t need to worry about anything. Highly recommend!!"

The place was beautiful, and there were so many lovely little touches that just made it perfect (like the freshly baked cookies and breakfast). The underfloor heating in the bathroom was incredible and the fire was so cosy. Mel have really helpful tips on getting there and into the accommodation, and had super quick communication. I hope to be able to go again soon!"
22869313,637053039,2020-07-12,351298424,Grace,"Your expectations will be exceeded above and beyond. My friends and I had an amazing 2 night stay at Queens Cottage and we were blown away. <br/><br/>The place was clean and tidy and Mel thought of literally everything. From the provision on cheese and wine, right down to the paper bags that were available when we were looking for extra bags upon leaving. <br/><br/>I would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the Barossa."
22869313,645439740,2020-08-02,66706658,Rhiannon,"Loved every second here! Such an inviting, clean and warm home.

22869313,701337482,2020-10-18,119195140,Hector,"If you could have someone think of your every holiday need or better still the things you did not know you knew, how amazing would that be?<br/>Thanks Mel, that was how we felt staying at your cottage in the Barossa.<br/>The cottage is so quaint and immaculately kept.<br/>Arriving to a fridge of beautiful local produce, wine and chocolate is such a treat. Great size bedrooms with starched linen, like all 5 star hotels.  Living room with a real fireplace and comfy sofa and chairs and cottage decor. Great big bathroom and extra loo works well if you are a group of 4.<br/>The detail is where Mel’s cottage sets itself apart from other properties.<br/>I didn’t even think of a picnic until we stumbled upon a picnic blanket and picnic hamper. A picnic at Angaston Lookout was awesome! Plush Robes, history of the area, games, centrally located in Williamstown. <br/>So many positives, the only negative is that we had to leave!<br/>Thank you so much Mel for such a wonderful stay! Highly recommend Queens Cottage!"

Very well set up kitchen with masses of cutlery, plates etc. Washing machine, easy access to line. Added extras include wine fridge and pool table. Two wineries within walking distance and easy access to town  and the rest of the Borossa. Fills a much needed gap in the market as a lot of Barossa accommodation caters only to couples."

There is also an outdoor area with large table and chairs and bbq. The kitchen is also large with everything you could need and more.

The place is so clean and perfect, either for a couple like us, a family or a group of friends to share. It was quiet, toasty and comfortable. Perfect!<br/>Thanks Tuoi. You are a wonderful host."

25893345,582980923,2019-12-28,182723544,Saumya,Its a great place one must go to. Very spacious and the structure/house it self is a wonderful place. The kids loved it.
25893345,723573069,2021-01-10,193376279,David,Nine mates and I stayed in the house in the house which is a grand old place and had a nice weekend but thought we had the house to ourselves. We were disappointed we weren’t made aware the house is sold off in sections like hotel rooms  with tiny kitchens and fridges in bedrooms and that we were sharing the house with other guests with only a locked door between us so at night had to be quiet and respectful to the other people  staying there which wasn’t easy with 10 of us. There are units at the back of the house also and all had access to the pool which at times made it difficult for all of us to go for a swim as there was a limit of 10 people in the pool area at one time. <br/>As we were taking away a friend who is terminal and we wanted to give him a great weekend with a lot of drinking and laughs but we were restricted in what we could do.<br/>Kym as a host was polite and responded to all correspondence in a speedy manner.<br/>David
25893345,736886713,2021-03-07,122621187,Charis,"Correspondence with this host that became an extremely horrible experience with her and Airbnb. I will not be booking again through Airbnb so I’m not concerned with a potential nasty review from this host. I do not typically leave reviews unless I have something positive to say, but here it is....<br/><br/>There have been a few issues since we arrived and it is rather disappointing given the price we are paying and how this property has been advertised.<br/><br/>- Booking suggests that we have booked the entire house, not that there are  multiple shared facilities with the apartments that are located on the same property directly behind the house.<br/><br/>- rowdy guests from apartments making inappropriate comments when we arrived. Then hogging the pool area being really loud, rowdy and putting us off going to the pool as their behaviour is quite disruptive and a bit intimidating.<br/><br/>- Random people from the apartments coming over onto the verandah and putting their empty bottles into the bins while we are sitting / chatting - no privacy or peace and quiet.<br/><br/>- Naked / screaming children were running through the back of the house / verandah area - no privacy or peace and quiet.<br/><br/>- apartment guests having a family reunion/ party for someone’s 30th -  no privacy or peace and quiet and as there is a “no party policy” this is not in keeping with that policy.<br/><br/>- Secure the dishwasher - it tips over when you are loading the dishes and the drawers tip out onto the floor injuring someone’s foot. This complaint was also on a 2018 TripAdvisor review but still continues.<br/><br/>- our booking says ‘entire house’ and we will have the entire home to ourselves. Yet another person showed up after the first 24 hours to stay in “the Ruby Suite”. This is not accurately represented in our booking.<br/><br/>- host said she would get back to us, but didn’t- this meant we were outside the Airbnb 24 hour window for resolution/ refund. <br/><br/>- host refused a refund and despite multiple other reviews on TripAdvisor and Airbnb voicing similar issues (only found these after our issues as they are hidden amongst glowing reviews for the apartments) there remains a complete lack of transparency in there advertising.<br/><br/>- This host is exploiting every possible Airbnb loophole and getting away with it in a recurring manner."
25915403,487236086,2019-07-14,92934565,Scott,A nice place to stay!
25915403,493071941,2019-07-22,18630617,Sandy,"Crystal’s home was absolutely lovely! The house was clean, tidy, cosy and inviting. It was close to everything we needed and wanted to see in the Barossa.<br/><br/>Crystal went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The fridge was stocked with ingredients to make breakfast, and Crystal even dropped off a coffee machine to us the day we arrived, after it was replaced. The fire was set up ready to light as soon as we arrived.<br/><br/>My correspondence with Crystal before and during our stay was always friendly, polite & prompt."

25915403,507726582,2019-08-12,88208940,James,Very neat property only moments into the Main Street. The host had the wood burning fire place lit well before we arrived so the home was already warm upon arrival. The breakfast and coffee provisions were also a pleasant suprise with ingredients for coffee and ham and cheese croissants. We also appreciated that the home had Netflix.

Great for the kids and had everything we needed.

25915403,630476146,2020-06-19,118464204,Stacey,"House was lovely and clean with nice touches, we really enjoyed the coffee pod machine, deep bath & wood fire heater was used both days and creates a beautiful ambience and all the warmth you need on the cold winters night..we really enjoyed sitting in front after we put our son to bed with a bottle of sparkling wine.<br/><br/>Banana bread was one of the best we’ve had and we really enjoyed! Bottle of OJ, cereal and a bottle of wine were lovely!<br/><br/>Master bedroom was spacious and easy enough to have the porta cot in room without tripping over.<br/><br/>Was extra special to be able to bring our dogs as one has to take medication twice a day so it’s hard to getway unless they are invited.<br/><br/>Fantastic location with a 15 minute walk to Lyndoch town, the town has a bakery and the vegetarian pasty was amazing!!! Also in town is the local pub with a bottle-o attached all staff lovely. The Lord Lyndoch for something a special was an enjoyable dinner with great staff.<br/>God Hill winery is 16 minute walk and the view is one of the best I’ve seen a photo doesn’t do it justice..Charlie the wine maker and owner is so lovely and passionate he also made us the best Italian platter and Sharon was beyond lovely and gave us such a experience with our one on one tasting..our one year old son absolutely loved her! Lots of fantastic (Website hidden by Airbnb) a must but ring before to book.<br/>Kies winery is a 26 min walk and you could spend the whole day there with a great grass area with activities and a gorgeous husky who is super friendly... wines are delicious. We then walked to Chateau Yaldara..there is no path for for about 19 minutes so walking is fine but with a pusher is a little more adventurous but definitely do it if your up for it, the landscape is gorgeous and plenty of photo opportunities. Chateau Yaldara is one of our favourites! Plenty of reasons location is breathtaking, great food and if you have kids a fantastic play area, and the wines are always good!<br/><br/><br/>Overall we had a great experience and would definitely stay again, thanks for having us we made lots of great memories."

The fireplace is nice and central, and great to curl up near it with a book or playing games.  The kitchen has everything you'd ever need, and the spa in the bathroom is a treat to relax in.<br/><br/>The host has thought of everything.  I know it's a bit more expensive but it's worth every cent.  We will definitely be coming here again if we are to stay in the Barossa in the future."

We appreciated all the generous and thoughtful touches. The rooms were spacious and beds comfortable. The kitchen was stocked up with everything you might possibly need. We enjoyed the walk to Angaston to pick up some homemade ice cream and there was a fabulous playground for the kids. For the adults, the cottage is close to wineries such as Yalumba and other attractions such as Maggie Beer. We also enjoyed sitting out in the backyard playing cards and soaking up the Barossa Valley atmosphere."

25928338,290152164,2018-07-14,92069202,Desiree,"When you talk about location this little pice of luxury is spot on.  The newly refurbished 3 bedroom house was the perfect break from reality that we were after.  The couch was comfy the heating was perfect the beds were amazing and so was the TVs and Netflix.<br/><br/>The kitchen was a pleasure to cook in and I can only imagine sitting on the deck (in warmer weather) with a glass of local wine and platter of produce  (which Sarah will happily organize for you) would be heaven.<br/><br/>Perfect for a couple, group of friends or a family as the property was totally enclosed and there was area for the children to play.  I would like to return with a group of girls so that we could indulge in a weekend of fine food, wine and fun.<br/><br/>Thanks for having us we had a very relaxing time.<br/>"

The house is super clean and the kitchen is fully stocked with all appliances and Utensils- we collected food from our day and then cooked dinner at night it was great! My daughter also left her favourite puppy at the house and Sarah found it and is sending it back to us! We are going to have one happy child! If we ever come back to the Barossa I wouldn’t stay anywhere else

25928338,478393552,2019-06-30,229735976,Stephanie,What an amazing home! The perfect getaway for 3 couples who want to enjoy a weekend wine by the fireplace surrounded by all that the Barossa has to offer. All the little touches were so well thought out! All of the amenities were amazing. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay.
25928338,487323339,2019-07-14,45197600,Gloria,"A sanctuary in so many ways... When looking for a place to celebrate my husband's 50th with a small group of friends it was very hard to find somewhere that catered for 3 couples, but that wasn't so big and expensive it wouldn't feel welcoming, especially in winter. Then I found the Sanctuary and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. The home is large enough to give 3 couples privacy but set up with enough seating and amenities to make it feel cosy, inviting and engaging. I would recommend it to a small group of friends who want to escape somewhere the same as if not nicer than home that is opulent, super comfortable and has the beautiful Barossa Valley at your doorstep. One of the best restaurants in the world (in my opinion) Ferment Asian is just a short stroll away which means you can treat yourselves to a special night out and not have to worry about driving or taxis. The outdoor deck would be great on a warm evening to sit and debate who bought the best wine whilst the BBQ cooks or a soak in the hot tub after a long day out exploring is equally as inviting and indulgent. There are lots of interesting books to read if you feel like you want to wind down and take yourself somewhere else whilst sitting in the comfy snuggle seat or take a long soak in the beautiful freestanding bathtub. This home is truly at sanctuary which ever way you look at it. Can't wait till we visit again."

We were greeted to a well presented, warm (heater put on for us), well lit (lights were on as we arrived around 6pm) and clean place, along with a delicious platter and wine.

25928338,588031552,2020-01-04,3041171,Tahnee,"Sarah's place is an amazing oasis in the heart of the Barossa Valley. It's such a treat to return to at the end of a long day wine tasting. The air conditioning is wonderful for beating the heat, the spacious layout is great for groups and the BBQ, hot tub and outdoor deck make it perfect for family gatherings. Sarah has provided all the amenities you'll need from shampoo and conditioner to laundry detergent. I also loved her wall of books and other thoughtful touches. The beds are on the softer side but not uncomfortable and the linens make for a dreamy night's sleep. The back bedroom is off the road so it's super quiet and peaceful. This is the perfect spot to stay in the Barossa."

25928338,770669046,2021-06-14,3329259,David,"Great spot to stay in Tanunda on the main road, close to stores, pizza places and 5-10 min driving to most wineries. Spa is amazing, chimney makes it super fun in winter and A/C warms up the whole house very nicely. the rooms are quite separate which makes it comfortable for two families."

25928338,450273212236275351,2021-09-13,24955882,Toni,Many thanks Sarah - your place was lovely for a long weekend for 2 couples travelling together.  We were fortunate to have 1.5 days in the sun on the deck and 1.5 days cozy by the fire.  Fabulous to be able to walk to restaurants and shops easily.  You were also fabulous to deal with - thank you again.
25928338,466127855326070751,2021-10-04,242432002,Lisa,"This property is ideal if you don’t want to be driving everywhere, comfy beds, Spa is great 😊 we will definitely stay again"
25928338,475612072901835294,2021-10-18,43921249,Gemma,"The house was nice and comfortable with good bathrooms and kitchen. Beds were super comfy which is a huge plus, and the spa is lovely. The best thing is definitely the location, it's almost adjacent to a supermarket and in very easy walking distance to the town and all the bars/restaurants. <br/>There were a couple of things which weren't so pleasant though. Despite us booking for 3 adults (and paying extra per adult), the third bedroom was locked when we got there. They assume that adults want to share a bed and claimed it was in the listing (we read and double-read it, is definitely not clear that 3 adults = 2 bedrooms. Also a bit misleading when you are searching Air BnB for a ""3-bedroom entire property""). <br/>The listing also said a bottle of wine was included for stays over 2 nights, we didn't get one, but whatever it's the Barossa right. There was no remote control for the lounge room TV that we could find, but we figured out how to use the buttons on the bottom of the tv eventually. There were some incomplete food amenities included, i.e. bread and vegemite, with no butter so we ended up having to go to the shops anyway. <br/>Overall a pleasant stay and I would definitely recommend to others wanting a house in Tanunda, but there are a couple of things they could work on to make it a 5-star stay."
25928338,482849412766555698,2021-10-28,108529093,Gayle,Do yourself a favour and stay here.  A beautiful home with everything you could possibly ask for and so close to everything in the main street.

26009146,290670531,2018-07-15,84807308,Gina,"Great unique location. The Barn and surrounds is a lovely cosy choice. Close enough to explore all of Barossa, but tucked away enough to enjoy a quiet retreat. <br/>Wonderful friendly hosts too!"

The property is stunning and the bed is super comfy! Not to mention, Carolyn, her husband and sons are completely delightful and really helpful with local tips about the area. Would come back in a heartbeat!"
26009146,295117757,2018-07-23,55404495,Angus,"lovely little single room beautifully renovated barn, tucked just far away from everything to feel alone, but not so far that you can't get around and enjoy the Barossa. Massive shower head!"

We felt like real locals waking up with rolling views.  Carolyn and her family have great knowledge of the vineyards and the local area which we appreciated. Thanks again. "
26009146,308146838,2018-08-16,21983514,Jemima,"Carolyn’s place was a lovely getaway. The barn itself was beautiful, clean, warm and comfortable. The bed is absolutely huge! Nice separate bathroom, a short walk from the barn. The view is beautiful! <br/>We had a great time staying here. Thank you so much!"
26009146,313732816,2018-08-26,55054818,Jonathan,Very cute and a perfect location. Thank you Carolyn for being a great host.

We loved meeting you all (including Angus and Ruby), and had such a lovely time staying in the Barn. What a gorgeous place to stay! We had everything we needed, the styling was stunning and what a view to wake up to in the morning! We both slept so well on the huge, extremely comfortable king bed and will be recommending all of our friends to make a trip to the Barossa to stay in Angaston ASAP. Thank you for being so friendly and kind!!!! A brilliant mini vacay! Xxxx"
26009146,326732081,2018-09-23,24607186,Jessica,We had a wonderful stay at Carolyn & William's farm. The Barn is a cosy and beautifully presented space with a huge comfy bed! It has everything you need for a short stay. The Barn is located near Angaston  and close to many of Barossa's  finest wineries and restaurants. Carolyn & William were excellent and accommodating hosts with great tips and recommendations.  We had a wonderful weekend and would definitely recommend the Barn to our friends and family!
26009146,329885665,2018-09-30,21033719,Lucy,"Carolyn was very helpful and lovely. The room is 10/10 as is the location. If you're staying a few days make sure you come prepared with small goods like milk, fruit and snacks. The room was lovely and warm and the bed comfy. Would definately go back."
26009146,331210278,2018-10-02,24955775,Monica,"The Barn is a beautiful stay in the Barossa that offers peace & quiet and a lovely view. The driveway is lined with blossoming trees, the hosts are lovely & will do anything to make your stay special. The Barn itself is fantastic - beautifully styled, huge comfortable bed & has everything you need. The toilet/bathroom is a 15m walk away on a boardwalk, so no big deal. I loved the historical aspect of it. Sunset drinks on the back deck were everything we imagined in the Barossa. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!"
26009146,333909381,2018-10-08,73654768,Amanda,"'The Barn' is a well appointed room, the host Carolyn anticipating most of your needs before you even know you have them.  Most things you'll find in your room and it's only a short well lit boardwalk across to the amenities. Would definitely stay here again!"
26009146,338993934,2018-10-21,141674557,Janelle,"The Barn is the most amazing little place to get away for the weekend. The Barn itself and facilities were so modern, new and fresh. The location is perfect and just outside Angaston where anything we needed was a small drive. Absolutely worth every penny for an adults weekend away, drink some wine, eat some cheese, visit some wineries and sights and veg out."
26009146,340418536,2018-10-23,58952949,Mark,"Carolyn is a good helpful host and is creating a charming Barossa country feel. The room is an old stone barn well renovated with beautiful linen, comfortable bed and large fun. There is a nice private outdoor sitting area with country views.<br/>However we were disappointed on arrival to find that the barn had no running water and the new  toilet and shower were 30m away up a boardwalk in a separate building. This is rather inconvenient in the middle of a cold night! To be fair the place description did say amenities were separate but it was not clear to us that this meant no en suite and the photos did not make it clear either.This needs to be emphasised in the advert as for that price one would expect self-contained facilities. We are sure when the renovations are complete this will be a great place to stay."
26009146,341416107,2018-10-26,90911355,JoanneJasper,Absolutely beautiful location. Carolyn is incredibly helpful and quick to respond in communication and provided lovely accommodation.  The Barn is exactly as described and pictured.  Thank you for making my experience so fuss free.
26009146,343526432,2018-11-01,21036207,Anthony,Thanks for the stay! A nice quiet place to go after seeing the Barossa. Loved the bed linen.
26009146,345743728,2018-11-05,85258073,Izzy,"The Barn was truly magical and was just what we needed for a long weekend getaway. Carolyn had thought of everything in regards to amentities, from extra towels and blankets to netflix and an array of delicious teas. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the peace and quiet of the Barn. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a romantic weekend away to enjoy some wine and soak in the peace and quiet."
26009146,348705008,2018-11-15,210920152,Chloe,Our stay was amazing! I would strongly suggest anyone going to the Barossa to stay at The Barn in Penrice. Carolyn is so accomodating and the Barn is in a beautiful setting.
26009146,350660264,2018-11-19,188614999,Bradley,The Barn is a beautifully located villa type home where everything you need is catered for. A great mix of old structures but modern facilities gives this place an edge on everywhere else. Would recommend.
26009146,353852426,2018-11-29,31930771,Gonda,"Wonderful stay, great location, great view. Beautiful and comfortable. Biggest bed ever! Just perfect!"
26009146,358874535,2018-12-16,118945315,Jeremy,"Carolyn and family very friendly and room was beautiful with fresh linen, lovely soft towels and beautiful view of countryside as well as great connection to Netflix. However take care when walking to amenities as very poor lighting on path to toilet and laundry at night causing a trip hazard and suggest much improved lighting. Solar lights provide insufficient lighting at night currently."
26009146,361593099,2018-12-23,57725038,Nicolette,"We had a fantastic stay! Beautiful accommodation, great hosts!! And so close to restaurants, wineries & sites! Can’t wait to come back ... definitely recommend!"

26009146,420180485,2019-03-05,173156006,Don,"Highly recommended for anyone wishing to ""escape"" and find serenity.  A well thought out space, comfortable ""large"" bed and gorgeous outlook.  The toilet and shower a short stroll away from the barn wasn't a problem.  We decided to stay in each night instead of eating out as we didn't want to miss the opportunity of enjoying the sunset and relaxing in such a lovely setting.  The property is situated within an easy drive to ""everywhere"" in the Barossa but you still feel like you are in the middle of ""nowhere""!!!"
26009146,422373926,2019-03-11,228592696,Jess,"Excellent acommodation, very clean and has everything you need."

26009146,425755345,2019-03-19,40677124,Thomas,"Excellent and helpful host, with lots of local information for tourists. The place was spotless and serene. Sitting on that decking, watching the sun set across the hills is special."

26009146,436376659,2019-04-13,56014130,Miranda,The perfect little retreat for a relaxing getaway! We stayed for 3 nights and didn’t want to leave. Carolyn is a very helpful & accommodating host. The king bed is super comfy & Carolyn has the place set up so well with all of the furniture & amenities. It’s hard to beat having a glass of wine on the deck watching the sunset over the fields! The lovely & spacious toilet/bathroom/shower is only 20 steps away and wasn’t an issue at all. Can’t wait to come back & stay again.
26009146,438922690,2019-04-18,252855910,Daniela,It is a lovely little getaway in the Barossa and close to all the wineries.
26009146,440549632,2019-04-21,157104869,Kate,Was nice place & beautiful balcony & close to other towns. We didn’t have any hot water for a day so had to have a cold shower. The bathroom is away from the room and the lights walking there were very dim so was hard to see where I was walking. Also would of been good to have a sink in the room rather than have to keep walking to the bathroom area.
26009146,448119212,2019-05-04,95989465,Scott,We had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying again in the future . Carolyn was a terrific host and made us feel very much at home . The property is ideally located a few kilometers from town and sits<br/>beautifully in a rural setting . Highly recommended !
26009146,470106079,2019-06-16,103196287,Maddy,"Carolyn is a great host, very easy and lovely to chat to. The gorgeous little barn house was way better then we expected, and had all the amenities so that my mum and I could enjoy a nice hot coffee and brekky in the mornings. Would recommend to anyone who's wanting to get away for the weekend!!"
26009146,516826409,2019-08-25,12693373,Astrid,"The perfect spot for a week end in the Barossa. The barn is very comfortable, the sky full of star and Carolyn and William were extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend staying there."
26009146,521465874,2019-09-01,35825460,Victoria,"Carolyn’s Barn is utterly idyllic! The perfect place for a weekend away to decompress from city life. We spent the weekend wine touring so brought bits with us for breakfast and despite its secluded location were even able to order a pizza at night! The room is very cosy, heating and a great big bed. The separate bathroom didn’t really bother us, just maybe bring your slippers so you don’t need put your shoes on every time you need to go :)"
26009146,524917641,2019-09-07,48738819,Laura,What a wonderful accommodation! My partner and i loved how it was so homely and the short walk to the amenities weren't a problem at all! <br/>Carolyn gave us a range of great suggestions for what to do in the Barossa which were perfect. We spent hours driving around the Barossa valley.<br/>Would definitely recommend the place to anyone heading to the Barossa!
26009146,535638019,2019-09-25,63147761,Genevieve,"We had a midweek stay at the gorgeous Barn and it was the perfect spot to explore the beautiful Barossa .

26009146,547778160,2019-10-16,89789,Sean,What a beautiful place to have spent a couple of nights at to give us access to the Barossa. Well appointed facility with all we needed. Sitting out on the patio with a bottle of red & some cheeses while the sun was setting was pretty special. Nice location to be able to get out to explore the region as well.
26009146,567595111,2019-11-22,157963239,Hilary,"We throughly enjoyed our stay, the barn was beautifully renovated with luxurious and stylish decor. It had everything we needed and was close to excellent wineries and restaurants. I would recommend this accommodation to any couple looking to experience the Barossa Valley."
26009146,568827225,2019-11-24,59082055,Samuel,"Fantastic location (close to all the wineries, food places and historical townships) just out of Angaston, the room is very private and open space with a cool layout looking out to the valley view.   The room offers everything you need and more.  If you are looking for a classy escape, this is your place with very friendly hosts.  Thank you again, Samuel & Mel."

Close to Angaston and Tanunda which had lots of good and drink options, not to mention a winery on every corner! Carolyn and William were great hosts and gave us lots of tips for the area. Would definitely recommend the Barn!"
26009146,584316598,2019-12-29,38423802,Sophie,"Carolyn and William were amazing hosts! The Barn was absolutely lovely and beautifully fitted out. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities were great. It was lovely to sit out on the private deck and look up at the stars. Despite the heatwave while we were staying, the Barn was very cool with AC and a fan. It was also great to have a dip in the pool. The bathroom is very close and no issue to get to. There were lots of brochures and guides in the room for guests and Carolyn kindly gave us some personal recommendations, all of which we loved! The location was great for getting around the Barossa. We were really impressed with the whole experience and will definitely be back the next time we come to the Barossa."

The perfect weekend in the Barossa made so by having such a wonderful place to come back to. Thanks so much again :-)

26009146,621185639,2020-03-29,18443973,Danielle,"The Barn is exactly as described and a lovely place to stay. Everything was immaculately clean and stylishly decorated. The facilities were great, very modern and clean. Carolyn and her partner are lovely hosts and it was a pleasure meeting them both. The night sky is outstanding in Penrice, you can see so much detail in the Milky Way. We enjoyed the local visitors too including a kangaroo, kookaburra and watching the neighboring sheep. Thanks for a relaxing stay!"
26009146,626885384,2020-05-31,5543447,Tiarne,My partner and I loved our stay at Carolyn's place. It was the perfect weekend escape and we loved all of the local tips Carolyn and William provided. We will be back!
26009146,636637062,2020-07-11,2901238,Rebecca,This little barn is beautifully finished with thoughtful touches. The French doors lead to a private deck that overlooks the rolling hills and perfect for your morning coffee. This barn has all the amenities that you’ll need. The host provided great local tips
26009146,637977431,2020-07-14,29296122,Despoina,"We had a lovely time. The Barn was warm, great views and the bed was so comfortable."

26009146,638863750,2020-07-17,9020740,Tom,"Awesome experience and stay. Nice and quiet, welcoming and amazing views at both day and night, highly recommended"
26009146,644079536,2020-07-30,41213038,Ben,Really nice to be just out of town with a proper country feel. The concept of building a small village is excellent and this building is a great part of it and really well done. Lovely little place for the middle of winter and a short cab ride from the nearest town. Perfect  central point for a Barossa stay.
26009146,648491736,2020-08-09,48553646,Claire,"We loved our stay here - very cosy. It was cold and rainy during our stay which made the trek to the separate bathroom a little bit tricky, but the room itself was so lovely that it more than made up for it. We would definitely stay here again!"
26009146,651752776,2020-08-16,301126355,Henry,"The photos of the Barn did not do justice to the space (I mean that in the best way possible)! It is absolutely stunning, loved that there was coffee beans and tea, the gigantic bed with heated blanket, the cordless charging ports was a special touch, the deck and outdoor space was perfect for our brunch with food from the Farmers Market. The bathroom and kitchenette was only a short walk along the pavement/deck. We had already planned out the weekend for my partners birthday, however if your stuck for ideas Carolyn was more then happy to offer local ideas and there was plenty of magazines, brochures and a home made guide book to the local area in the barn. I would absolutely recommend this place to any couple looking to get away to the Barossa."
26009146,654477670,2020-08-22,325507256,Sam,"Great Little Spot, good value for money."
26009146,655054088,2020-08-23,178518219,Jake,"Very clean, great facilities and a beautiful room! Some really nice thoughtful touches that really does make a difference. The toilet and shower is seperate to the room however still private and not really an issue! Definitely recommend when staying in the Barossa."
26009146,657161322,2020-08-27,28205126,Fletcher,"The Barn was all we hoped for, the bed was enormous"
26009146,659270274,2020-09-01,38306686,James,A great experience :)
26009146,662483185,2020-09-09,325705451,Paul,"Fantastic place to stay! The place was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of extra little bonuses such as wireless charges for phones, Bluetooth speaker, and lots of tea/coffee options. For anyone staying who is worried about having a bathroom separate to the main building, it is a VERY short distance away and was not an issue at all. Bathroom was clean and tidy, and had a fantastic shower with a rain shower head! 5 minutes drive from the main town Angeston and 10minutes to a heap of great wineries, we had a fantastic time and highly recommend this place as somewhere to stay!"
26009146,663087729,2020-09-12,365516118,Jodie,Beautiful spot to relax and forget your worries...will be back!

26009146,668950676,2020-09-28,117507273,Josh,Fantastic relaxing place to stay. Very peaceful and had everything you need to unwind. Great location and not too far from anything
26009146,671767065,2020-10-06,215121430,Milly,This place is one of the best we’ve ever stayed at. The photos really don’t do it justice; we were in awe constantly with the beautiful property. Not to mention Carolyn’s amazing hospitality too; it was the perfect stay! Will definitely be back ☺️
26009146,672012318,2020-10-07,44437622,Mim,"Beautiful space in a lovely setting in the Barossa region. The room is so comfy and beautifully styled and has everything you need. There are terraces for sitting outside the room and a covered living room space next to it where we sat with a cup of tea in the morning looking across the garden. The bathroom really is a short little hop from the room and is beautifully done with a great shower.  Carolyn is a great host, quick to communicate and gave us good tips for the area. We only stayed one night but would definitely return next time we’re in the Barossa!"
26009146,672247724,2020-10-07,89664627,Claire,Lovely little place for a quick stop over on our way to the Flinders Rangers
26009146,673078582,2020-10-10,42117032,Adelle,"Such an amazing weekend away. The most gorgeous cottage, so private. The separate bathroom is not a problem. The bed is huge and I miss it!!! Carolyn is a great host and very helpful with recommendations. STAY HERE!"
26009146,700721342,2020-10-15,239714917,Amy,"A truly beautiful barn - the space was characteristic & cosy :) Not to mention, amazing views, especially from the loo ;) Carolyn was such a welcoming, easy going and helpful host! <br/>My Mum was in awe of the assortment of tea provided & we both very much enjoyed the recommendation for our lunch outing! Oh & the attention to detail exceeded our expectations; from an umbrella by the door for when it drizzled and beautiful flowers around the place, everything had been thought of ! We definitely hope to visit again someday :)"
26009146,701011253,2020-10-17,31273819,Jonathan,"Great location, great communication, would recommend to others visiting the Barossa region."
26009146,701960405,2020-10-19,189593470,Alex,This is why AirBnb exists! The Barn was so comfortable and made our trip to the Barossa. The bed was huge and the heater / air con unit meant it was so cozy. It was well kitted out and beautifully designed. It was just so unique and we spent half our time eating cheese and drinking wine on the decking. We didn’t know what to expect from the outside bathroom but it only added to the experience. Getting a good look at the starry sky made it all worthwhile! Thanks to Will and Carolyn for being exceptional hosts.
26009146,702431629,2020-10-20,253545214,Pam,"Loved our two nights at ‘The Barn’, definitely worth more than a night to soak up the country amosphere. Not only is the sleeping accomodation charming and wonderfully inviting, that huge billowy bed requiring the obligatory lay in, but the cosy but spacious sitting and cooking area ‘the pug house’ is delightful to while away a comfy hour or three with a book or bottle of local wine. There are numerous dining in and take away food places open till quite late within a 10minute drive but the pug house was so inviting we shopped at the local iga and cooked a full meal both nights with the adequate facilities and soaked up the twinkling candlelit ambience. If you love to get away from it all yet have everything at your fingertips Carolyn’s is that spot. Highly recommend. Ps, the night visit to the luxury loo is a starlit wonder to behold if you don’t see the heavens often."
26009146,702836196,2020-10-22,340898695,Edward,"The Barn literally has it all!!!!not only that it is very stylish and worth every cent!!! William and Carolyn were great hosts, so helpful and offered some great tips on where to go in the Barossa.<br/>A must stay!!!"
26009146,704066371,2020-10-26,13914035,Alana&Jay,"Beautiful, comfortable and thoughtfully decorated/designed - thank you we loved it"
26009146,707017203,2020-11-06,25613922,Adam,Carolyn's place is great! Rustic with a sense of luxury and comfort. Carolyn has thought of everything to make the stay as welcoming as possible. Great place to stay when in the Barossa :)
26009146,707741198,2020-11-08,49529731,John,"A fantastic stay, extremely comfortable with a beautiful view. We loved it and hope to be back one day soon!"
26009146,708103869,2020-11-10,231055717,Naomi,"I stayed at Carols Airbnb for 2 nights & the space Carol & her husband have created is perfect for a country escape or if your looking for affordable accommodation near the Barossa.<br/>The king size bed was super comfy, the cottage & the seperate bathroom was super clean & although the toilet & shower are seperate from the cottage it was not an issue & literally just a few steps away.<br/>The private decking area attached to the cottage is a great peaceful space to have your coffee in the morning, a glass of wine in the evening or just to sit, relax & read a book. There was a big electrical storm one of the nights of my stay in which the power was out for a few hours & Carol was quick to make sure I was ok & to see if I needed anything. Comforting considering I was staying there on my own. Thanks so much for your great hospitality Carol 😃"
26009146,708407351,2020-11-13,44721214,Callum,"The Barn far exceeded our expectations. Carolyn met us on arrival and gave us a brief tour of the space before leaving us to relax. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we spent some time enjoying the sun and drinking wine on the outdoor patio.<br/><br/>Carolyn and her partner were kind enough to lend us their barbecue to make dinner one evening, and always made sure we had everything we needed. Absolutely one of our favorite AirBnb locations we have ever stayed in. We couldn't recommend this enough! Thank you again Carolyn."
26009146,709546241,2020-11-16,375344046,Bec,the barn is a lovely place to stay for peace and quiet! very earthy and pretty!
26009146,709697857,2020-11-18,4265384,Kim,"Carolyn has done a beautiful job decorating the small stone barn, the king size bed was very comfortable, the location is so quiet at night, stunning night sky to view the stars. We enjoyed having aircon, a ceiling fan, smart TV and a space to prepare simple meals. Carolyn was a great host with prompt communication."
26009146,713588662,2020-12-05,183869048,Steve,Very luxurious and relaxing spot within easy reach of everything in the Barossa Valley. Really well appointed and tastefully decorated. You don't want for anything here except a nice bottle of local wine to enjoy on the back deck. William and Carolyn are great helpful hosts.
26009146,714193245,2020-12-08,61725164,Gary,"Quirky, quiet, comfortable and  very close to Angaston yet great 'bush' feel"
26009146,715445915,2020-12-13,77866947,Natalie,"Wow wow and wow!<br/>I’m not really one to write reviews but this little gem really is something else. <br/>We absolutely loved our two night stay in the barn. Carolyn has thought of everything. <br/>Exactly as described and even better than the pics. <br/>The most beautiful and comfortable big bed, seperate cooking/dining area if you wish although the beautiful little town of Angaston is only a 5 minute drive. We came for a weekend from Sydney and I just want to do it all again 💛"
26009146,715964642,2020-12-16,175005949,Okydoky99,"Very relaxing, awesome stay.  Great hosts. Highly recommended.  👍"
26009146,716357639,2020-12-18,2485362,George,"Incredible accommodation, and the best Airbnb experience I've had. Carolyn and William have done an amazing job restoring the historic buildings, the photos dont do it justice.<br/>You can simply arrive without having done any research or planning as they have included a fantastic guide to the wineries, food, tours and experiences you can do in the region. I had spent a lot of time looking into what to do beforehand and picking up their guide was much easier than searching through multiple websites. <br/>Can't recommend this place enough, we'll be back for sure!"
26009146,718978271,2020-12-27,374004351,Samuel,"Great place to stay while experiencing the Barossa! Very comfortable stay with beautiful outdoor areas to relax in. The barn was charming, cosy and the decor had clearly received a lot of attention to detail. Still had all the modern facilities - pretty reliable wifi, smart TV, streaming services, a portable Bluetooth speaker, A/C and a massive, comfortable bed. The back deck and outdoor couch were quite private. <br/><br/>Toilet and shower were a short (and well lit) walk along the deck and were both modern and clean. Access to the pool was great during our summer stay. Carolyn and William were very hospitable and up for a chat, but certainly not overbearing. Definitely would recommend."
26009146,719556538,2020-12-29,151965846,Peter,"Delightful place in Penrice, barely removed from Angaston and Tanunda. Picturesque, cosy, so many thoughtful touches. Beautiful to look out onto the hills during the day and stars at night. Had we stayed longer we could have had a go at the pool and barbecue. Would highly recommend this to couples looking for a romantic getaway."
26009146,720630770,2021-01-01,50695818,Olivia,"Thank you very much for the lovely stay, tips and most importantly the good humour. Could not recommend the barn more highly!"
26009146,722657053,2021-01-07,25639058,Jacquie,"We had an excellent stay at The Barn and would highly recommend it. Every convenience has been thought of and attended to. The decor is beautiful, and there are a number of luxury touches: huge king sized bed, wireless phone chargers, chrome cast, Netflix and Stan, private deck in addition to the pool and bbq areas. It was really outstanding 🌻"
26009146,723585435,2021-01-11,37870187,Courtney,Beautiful little barn - lots of lovely little touches and really close to the centre of town. It was one of the hottest weekends we've had all summer and we were super comfortable. Thankyou!

26009146,734371024,2021-02-26,99815435,John,Charming accommodation.  Definitely recommend staying if you are looking for a unique experience as the bathroom is a very short distance from your room. Great for star gazing. Everything was clean and tidy with attention to the small details. We loved the the super sized king bed which was extremely comfortable. Carolyn and William were great hosts and we enjoyed watching their playful puppy and kitten playing together much like the movie “Milo and Otis”.
26009146,736007401,2021-03-02,168452054,Victor,"Highly recommended, friendly and gracious host. You will love the effort the host have put into the decor, and the little thoughtful touches dotted around the place. The rear deck is perfect for star gazing. This place has charm by the bucket loads. Don’t forget to ask the Carolyn & Mike for dining recommendations."
26009146,736354108,2021-03-05,103324160,Jem,"I was excited to stay here because it seemed interesting and looked beautiful, but it was honestly even better than I expected. Most comfortable bed ever, and I loved sitting on the deck with a wine, watching a kookaburra hop about nearby. Carolyn was very welcoming and friendly, and gave us a great suggestion for a bushwalk when she found out that's what we wanted to do. Would love to stay again."
26009146,736592353,2021-03-05,149627433,Michael,A perfect place to stay if you're visiting the Barossa. It is a good space in a nice location with great hosts.
26009146,738196985,2021-03-12,19531409,Tom,"We had a great stay, Carolyn and William were great hosts and the barn was perfect. Although you are not that far from their residence, the barn is super private with it’s own outdoor space as well as the pug lounge. Is close enough to the towns to not be inconvenient, but far enough out to escape the noise/light and to feel very secluded."
26009146,739288746,2021-03-14,202946330,Sophie,"What a perfect weekend we spent at The Barn!!! It was the most relaxing little getaway. William our host met us on arrival and gave us a tour of our weekend property. Only a short drive to Angaston which has great food options. William told us about the Farmers Market on Saturday mornings which we picked up some amazing local produce for our weekend stay. Highly recommend staying here, we will definitely will be staying here again."

A cute little stone cottage with privacy and views, and a kitten and puppy to play with. A 5 min drive to the nearby town of Angaston, you can even get food delivered, which was nice after a day spent cycling around the wineries. We wished we had stayed a bit longer!"

They have included so many thoughtful touches in the Barn and are very hospitable. We loved chilling on the deck of the Barn, it is completely private and has great sunsets. The bed is HUGE and so comfortable! Their cute kitten came down and paid us a visit which we loved. Would absolutely recommend the Barn to others! What a special place."

26009146,753154628,2021-04-30,49108683,Grant,"A little bit rustic and a little but lux is a great description of this place.  While the bathroom is separate from the ""bedroom"" it wasn't much of a problem for us.  We had a full moon and it wasn't too chilly.  There are great spaces here to chill out and cook and mediate at sunrise and have a romantic dinner at home.  Just lovely."
26009146,754973427,2021-05-04,58140104,Varvara,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the beautiful Pug cottage! It’s got so much character!

26009146,757654380,2021-05-13,374612370,Jessica,The barn is in the perfect location to explore the Barossa. The little town near by angaston is so cute and all the wineries are within 15-20 mins. Beautiful sunrises out on the property. Nice casual pug lounge to hang out in and like a glamping experience with shower and<br/>Toilet seperate to the barn. Would recommend bringing some food for the bbq if you want to make a meal there.
26009146,759996979,2021-05-18,280800755,Vincent,A really nice place to stay in a rural setting that is close to town and accessible to all the Barossa has to offer. The Barn is very well appointed with all the amenities you need. Carolyn met us on arrival and showed us around before leaving us to have our private getaway.<br/><br/>Recommend it to anyone wanting a nice and quiet break.

Definitely recommend."
26009146,770683151,2021-06-15,88769783,Bernard,"Thank you for having us at this charming cottage in a farm setting. All of the decor and provisions were of a high standard, and we enjoyed the view from the decking across to the fields."

26009146,395129975960128664,2021-06-29,3832333,Tamara,"A gorgeous little cabin tucked away amongst farmland.  The outdoor lounge area was a great spot for BBQ meals and to catch the sunshine during the day.  The seperate toilet wasn't an issue, even on late night dashes.  My favourite spot was sitting outside watch the stars at night with a wine from the nearby vineyards!"
26009146,398071238990597573,2021-07-03,85033380,Kathryn,"The barn was a lovely, different place to stay. The bed was amazing and the heating was good considering we chose a couple of cold wet days to be away. The bathroom was lovely but, as stated, you have to be ok with a short walk. Even though we were there when it was cold and wet it didn’t take long to forget about the cold bathroom floor once you were under the lovely rainfall shower. I would like to stay again when the weather is warmer so we could enjoy the deck and the pug lounge as it has great ambiance."
26009146,399528046039019179,2021-07-05,233007821,Michelle,"Carolyn is a wonderful host. Excellent communication.

Very convenient location while still feeling like we were away from the rest of the world.  Carolyn and William were very welcoming and had some great recommendations of where to visit.
26009146,424934685575775001,2021-08-09,99559137,Vanessa,"The view from Carolyn's Airbnb is gorgeous. We were lucky enough to enjoy the view in the company of Carolyn's adorable pug, Tanzanite. <br/><br/>The Airbnb and facilities were clean and felt homey. If you plan on bringing your own food, I would recommend checking that the bar fridge is on. We unfortunately didn't notice that it was not on until it was too late and our food had to be thrown out. <br/><br/>Although Carolyn lives on the property, she respects privacy."
26009146,434314026761364438,2021-08-22,173147640,Andrea,Amazing little stay at the Barn. Highly recommend. We had our 4 month old along with us and it was a great place for her also.

26009146,443025725069172674,2021-09-03,288722788,Leanne,"Thank you Carolyn and William for creating a thoroughly enjoyable place to stay.  We loved the outdoor decking area, where we could sit, relax and take in the lovely vista.  The bed was amazing!  The toilet/bathroom being removed from the barn was fine.  It was close, and had adequate lighting to guide the way.  Leanne & Rick"
26009146,444452586635624929,2021-09-05,346506850,Trish,"Lovely comfortable couples accomodation.  Bed was amazing and all the amenities you could ask for. The walk across the courtyard to the bathroom was a bit chilly at night but it’s not far and robes are provided.  Despite the weather being a little damp and cold, we were wonderfully warm in the cottage and throughly enjoyed the opportunity to switch off and enjoy the quiet and amazing views.<br/>Recommend making yourself a platter of local produce, grabbing a bottle of local red and chilling in the pug lounge like we did. Perfect for a relaxing afternoon"

A very relaxing and special place. The very sweet and friendly cat is an added bonus! We will be back.
26009146,508958301890405952,2021-12-03,172916039,Holly,Lovely space to unwind. Carolyn and William were really accommodating. The small walk to the bathroom is not an issue at all unless you have mobility challenges. Great location and comfy facilities.
26009146,510406484887025928,2021-12-05,106532853,Lea,Beautiful surroundings and very friendly hosts.  Location is great for touring around the wine region.

26009146,530674830866575171,2022-01-01,229034366,Renee,"Was sad to leave! A great way to end the year, the barn had everything you needed, very clean and had plenty of amenities. The pool was cleaned every day which was really thoughtful, couldn't have asked for a better way to end the year. <br/>it's located well away from anyone else so its very quiet but is also just a short drive to the main town<br/>Wonderful hosts, will definitely be back, thank you both!"
26009146,532124986393158979,2022-01-03,25255522,Mandy,"The picturesque Barn - an absolute pleasure to stay in the Barossa. It had everything we needed for our stay - milk, grind your own coffee, microwave, fridge, a/c and Netflix. <br/><br/>William gave us really great tips on places to eat and wine cellars to see (the grounds of Seppeltsfield were Amazing - and Fino delicious).<br/><br/>We didn’t mind the walk to the Separate Bathroom and shower block thanks to the soft robes provided. The sink and clean up area is also located away from the sleeping quarters. It is a little a kin to glamping in a modern upgraded barn cottage. The dip in the pool, which we had to ourselves was lovely. Just don’t forget to take your rubbish out to the Pug Lounge to avoid the ant march.<br/><br/>We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend The Barn!"

26009146,537155420406421704,2022-01-10,78175661,Anjulee,"The Barn is a very unique and beautiful location and was exactly as described in the post. You do need to be okay with bugs in the shower and toilet area which are separate to the main cabin, but it is very rustic and charming. We went in the height of summer so bugs are part of the experience and to be expected. Carolyn and William are very accommodating and responsive  hosts. If you enjoy nature and ambience of a property that feels very secluded and special, this is the place for you."

26403678,354491958,2018-12-02,64195,Megan,"This 3 bedroom home is a great find! The pool & backyard space was lovely & peaceful, & the kitchen was great for some self-catering.

The house is tastefully decorated and the bed and sofa is very comfortable. The pool and backyard area, with its lovely greenery, is serene and relaxing. The backyard and house is suitable for a family getaway with 3 bedrooms, a well equipped big kitchen, and swings and a sandpit area in the backyard. Tuoi is a warm and helpful host, and showed us around and explained things on check-in. Thank you, again, Tuoi! My husband and I have been huge fans of Tuoi's restaurant, FermentAsian, for several years now - the food is amazingly delicious, fresh, and just a wonderful balance of South East Asian flavours. FermentAsian is one of our all-time favourite restaurants. We highly recommend both this accommodation and the restaurant.<br/>Jayne and Glenn, Adelaide, SA."
26403678,358856529,2018-12-15,1305308,Aranie,"We had a wonderful stay at 29 Jane Place for a girls weekend. Her place is beautiful and clean, she was easy to communicate with and very warm and welcoming, and dinner at her restaurant FermentAsian was one of the standout meals on the trip.

We walked everyday to breakfast on the main St of Tanunda, and then dinner at FermentAsian. Perfect house in a perfect location!"
26403678,548540867,2019-10-17,29675898,Helen,Tuoi’s place in Tanunda was gorgeous and walking distance to the Main Street. Tuoi was so responsive and friendly. We had such a great time exploring the Barossa Valley from our fabulous base in Tanunda. Highly recommended!
26403678,556966312,2019-10-31,156741473,Trischa,"Very clean place with great features, pool was amazing, very accommodating host who let us check in earlier. Communication was fast and clear<br/>2 small things that should be noted are; it’s directly across from a school which wasn’t something we were expecting and the 4th bedroom and 2nd bathroom are actually a granny flat."
26403678,568079512,2019-11-24,14773737,Fiona,We were 6 adults and a toddler and this house suited everyone. It is in a great location - easy walking distance to the main strip of shops and cafes. Particularly loved the large bedrooms and the kitchen / appliances. My grandson thoroughly enjoyed the swings and toys in the large backyard - I only wish it had been warmer to enjoy the lovely pool area. Great stay in a wonderful part of Australia

There are three spacious bedrooms with comfortable king beds and one (Website hidden by Airbnb) annex has a further bedroom and (Website hidden by Airbnb) stayed as a family with two babies and were glad that the heating worked well,the kitchen was nicely set up for cooking meals and the laundry facilities were easy to use.The vine covered outdoor pergola and pool area is lovely.Perfect for relaxing with a glass of local wine."

26403678,603198918,2020-02-08,58635473,Marilyn,This 4 bedroom home was the perfect place to stay with other couples for a weekend in the Barossa. It was close to many wineries and the other towns. The Main Street was an easy walking distance from the house with plenty of eating options.<br/>We enjoyed sitting around outside listening to the great sound system and Tuoi was just a call away when we couldn’t work out how to operate it.<br/>We had a lovely weekend.
26403678,606068890,2020-02-15,77396752,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful stay here. The house was amazing and had everything we needed for our short stay. <br/>Tuoi was very easy to communicate with and always responded promptly when we had questions, and she very kindly let us have an early check in and late check out.

The kitchen was well equipped, the place spotless.  As a host, Tuoi could not be beat.  She arrived to check us in, gave us a quality bottle of wine, and made us a reservation at her restaurant, FermentAsian.  We've been traveling all over Australia and we haven't had a better meal than we had at FermentAsian.  Do NOT miss making a reservation there."
26403678,616150503,2020-03-08,11515935,Katherine,Tuoi is a friendly and helpful host. Her big older house is very clean with a modern kitchen. It was easy to find and we enjoyed our stay in the Barossa.

The bedrooms are all spacious with comfy king size beds. 3 bedrooms are in the main house with the 4th is in a separate, very large ensuite studio out the back. The kitchen has the basics for cooking, but if you need anything like platters or bowls you'll need to bring your own. The lounge and dining area is quite small and would be a bit of a squeeze if you had 8 people. Fantastic location close to the town centre. A perfect place to chill for our girls weekend!"
26403678,660788563,2020-09-06,31480723,Peta,"A sensational location for 4 couples to stay and relax.  Location is a short easy walk to Tanunda main street, with multiple restaurants, cellar doors, pubs and shopping nearby.  The kitchen is well appointed, the beds, soft and comfortable.  The sound system is fantastic.  Host was amazing, met us at the home and showed us around.  Fermentasian is a must!"

There was no tea (we bought a big box and left it) there was no basic cooking items like butter and oil (we also bought and left), and no tea towels or hand wash in the kitchen. We also bought a tea towel and left it. <br/><br/>I also felt that a bbq would have been great, and the host did offer to bring one over. <br/><br/>Lovely wine glasses and dishes as well as bedding and blockout curtains."

We will have to come back in summer so we can use your pool 🏊‍♀️. It was a bit too cool in August to use it for us ☃️. Great having the granny flat out the back as we had our kids and little ones in the house so we could spread out was helpful. Sorry we didn’t get to your restaurant this trip but have been a few months early when we stayed with friends and the food is amazing. All the best and hope to see you again soon. Helen"

The cottage is spacious and tastefully furnished, with great heating/cooling and a lovely shower. There are extra touches that add to the sense of welcome - books to read, a lovely tea pot and cups, a bench beneath a spreading oak tree. Remnant bushland is a short walk from the cottage, and a delightful place to walk and soak up the beauty of the South Australian scrub - complete with kangaroos and lots of native birds. While the cottage is close to the owners’ house, they have gone out of their way to preserve my privacy. I have truly had the most relaxing, refreshing weekend. Thank you!"
27065195,309823381,2018-08-18,198248102,Tamara,"Francis and Anne gave us a warm welcome! We immediately felt relaxed in the lovely bush land surrounding us. The cottage is sparkling clean, beautifully done and full of thoughtful little touches to make our stay comfortable. While the cottage is near the main house our privacy was respected. Anne also offered to collect pizza for our dinner so we could relax 😊 The walking track around the property was lovely, and we awoke to kangaroos, galahs and parrots outside our door.  The forest nearby is great for exploring and the drive up from Adelaide was very scenic. An idyllic weekend escape for us. Thank you both 😊"
27065195,312636717,2018-08-24,209399624,Maryke,"A beautiful self-contained Cottage in the South Australian countryside. Lovely facilities and very thoughtful hosts. you might want to stay a few nights, as it is such a short distance to the Barossa Wine Region. We only got to one winery and realised there was so much more to explore. Excellent if you are looking for a tranquil retreat.Thank you Anne and Francis for a memorable and very enjoyable stay."

27065195,336104512,2018-10-14,17618178,Andrew,"The cottage is cute, cosy and clean. We had a fantastic stay! The place was beautiful. Francis and Anne were very hospitable and took us for a walk around the 20 acre property and showed us their family of dogs. The cottage is out the back of the house so if you want your own privacy you can have that. We chose to interact with the hosts a lot which was really enjoyable. The porch of the cottage was a highlight, sitting there with a tea/coffee watching the birds, dogs, and nature was very peaceful. <br/><br/>Highly recommended!"

Anne and Francis were very accommodating and helpful. We found this place to be very clean, stylish, comfortable with everything you needed and perfectly sized for two people. The bathroom and shower was excellent. Furthermore, they clearly explained the area, and offered a guided tour of the property. I honestly think this is a bargain. We would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend this beautiful cottage."

27065195,352211938,2018-11-25,137021432,Alina,"We stayed for just one night, but wish we could stay longer.  Francis and Anne were most welcoming and cordial.  The cottage is sparkling clean and fresh, well equipped for tea/coffee and a light breakfast or snack (microwave, toaster, kettle and a small fridge).  The hosts attend to it with great attention to detail.  The bed is comfortable with high quality linen and towels.  Some chocolates and the fresh flowers were a nice touch.  <br/>In the middle of the bush and near Mt Crawford forest, the air is  clean and fragrant, pleasure in every breath.  Several options for a nice walk right around, and plenty more of really picturesque walks within a short drive.   <br/>A nice added bonus is the joy of watching the amazingly playful puppies (though they are already much bigger than most dogs we ever met).  Thank you Francis and Anne!"

27065195,469573142,2019-06-15,28913374,Anne,"A wonderful cabin set on the boundary between Adelaide Hills and Barossa makes for a great go between if you want to visit both in a short period of time. While it’s away from any amenities- it suited us perfectly as we could see the stars, woke up to kanagarooa and birds and could feel totally unplugged. Francis and Anne were very attentive and made sure we were settled and happy- super hosts!"

I spent hours reading on the propert and when we felt like it we just jumped in the car and were minutes away from all that Barossa has to offer.   We also loved how we could easily reach the Adelaide Hills via some beautiful scenic driving.  <br/>The cottage is adorable and spotless with a fridge and toaster and microwave.  Francis and Anne are fabulous hosts, it felt like we were staying with dear friends but had the privacy of your own space.  Francis provided some fabulous local insights.<br/>We are delighted to have stayed here and hope to return next year again!"

It is well maintained, clean and well appointed  for a comfortable, peaceful and enjoyable stay. Francis is readily on hand for any problems, queries or tips on activities, sights etc as he is a long term resident with an intimate knowledge of the area. We highly recommend it!"
27065195,726080748,2021-01-22,28667238,Mary,"Normally I will search in the higher price bracket in AirBnb listings to stay in a quality environment and quality accommodation. This place is way too inexpensive for what is on offer. Where do I start? Small but roomy cottage in beautiful bush environment, secluded and rural but with the owners in the house separate but alongside you feel safe and secure. Francis and Anne respect your privacy but will give you a warm welcome and be available if you have any questions. Thank you Francis for sharing your valuable knowledge and expertise and thank you Anne for your cheery and friendly chat. This is an environment where nature is respected. Now to the cottage... Very cute, impeccably clean, TV reception good, great shower, comfy bed. As for the environment it is paradise, bird song and various species sighted and/or heard. Private outdoor sitting area. No kitchen sink/stove etc but microwave/toaster/jug is all you need. After all a true holiday is no cooking lol! Nice shower, good air-conditioning. Memories of sitting outside at dusk listening to nature with a glass of red in hand. This place has got to be the best value listing on Airbnb and we've been to a few!"
27065195,726282303,2021-01-23,65329841,Melissa,"What a beautiful space Francis has created. We had a lovely stay and felt completely at home.

Thank you."

27065195,729120968,2021-02-05,96051463,Laura,As a single female traveller I felt very safe staying in this wonderful cottage. It was a rather exciting stormy night and I loved listening to the sounds of the wind and rain whilst tucked up in the most comfortable bed. I also very much enjoyed a short walk around the woodland and spotted some kangaroos. Thank you so much to this wonderful couple for a lovely night away and for their plentiful tips to explore the Barossa valley.
27065195,729319906,2021-02-06,33491169,Mel,"We enjoyed a 1-night stay at Francis's little cottage which consists of a main room with bed, two armchairs, table, and kitchenette, as well as a spacious bathroom overlooking a large oak tree and gardens. Francis was very welcoming and responsive to our questions. We enjoyed being immersed in the landscape - the sound of rain on the roof, smells of the eucalypts as we walked along their bush track, the rooster crowing at dawn, the friendly howls and barks of the beautiful Wolf Hounds, and the family of wood ducks waddling past for a feed. While it may not be everyones cup of tea, we would definitely stay there again."

There's a lovely walking track on the property and the Mawson Trail nearby.  Not being dog people, we found the periodic barking from the Irish wolfhounds a bit of a disturbance at times.  Otherwise the location is very quiet, with kangaroos hopping around.   There are limited kitchen facilities but we knew this before arrival.  Bathroom facilities and room heating were both excellent."
27065195,759784697,2021-05-18,47527284,Barry,"Very comfortable, cabin style accommodation."

Being able to disconnect from the world and just spend time together is something we didn’t realise we were missing. Francis and his wife were so hospitable and kind. Due to the festival we had to alter the check in time and Francis was very accommodating. The cabin was so sweet and the bed was SO comfortable.  <br/>We’ll be back soon, no doubt about that."

27409406,723140525,2021-01-09,323390327,Shaun,"The Dairymans Cottage is the ideal weekend getaway in the Barossa. Situated  a short drive from local wineries and restaurants its country charm is a refreshing break. Michael and his staff provide a warm and inviting environment in which he happily shares his knowledge of sustainable farm living. The local produce provided is straight from paddock to plate, offering a great opportunity to enjoy the most delicious food in the area. The cottage itself is neat, tidy and tucked away to provide a relaxing connection to the country, with all the amenities expected in a fancy hotel. We were greeted by the most loving ‘red dog’ who visited us every so often just to check in on our stay. We will definitely be back in the future!"

We also loved using the barbecue to cook fresh sausages and enjoy sunset over the paddocks.<br/>Thanks Michael for a delightful stay! Highly recommended to prospective guests!

27409837,541853725,2019-10-05,4526333,Vivian And Neil,"My review will look like the first review of Dairyman’s Cottage on Airbnb but lots of reviews on (Website hidden by Airbnb) which was very helpful.<br/>Like most reviews we found the breakfast provisions outstanding and was really the highlight of our stay.<br/>From Michael’s farm fresh to us, we had fresh eggs, pasteurised butter milk, fantastic farm butter, sliced leg ham, cured prosciutto, bacon, pork sausages. We also had locally produced camembert, fantastic bread by local baker Eleni (Website hidden by Airbnb) breakfast oats, dried fruit, nuts and dark chocolate on the table when we arrived. What a bounty. <br/><br/>We picked the 2 bedroom cottage - ideal for 2 couples with 2 bedrooms with QB each with modern ensuites. The beds  and pillows were very comfortable.<br/><br/>It is located in the heart of the Barossa with tons of great wineries within a 30 minute drive. The Barossa Farmer’s Market about 30 minutes away is very worthwhile visiting with high quality produce including Dairyman’s Barossa produce on show and Eleni’s bakery (the croissant was very buttery and delicious too). The Market is only open Saturday mornings 7.30am to 11.30am.  We bought lots of cheeses, preserves, dried fruit - great gifts to take home.<br/><br/>It was our first farm stay and we had a great experience. We watched Charly milk the cows, Michael feed the pigs- free range heritage pigs - were fed milk and oats. 3 of the chickens would roost near our cottage and Charly would find eggs around the milking shed. Ruby the dog was a friendly addition. Thank Michael. You’re an excellent responsive host!"

Michael was so accommodating and gave us produce from the farm on arrival which was absolutely delicious!   Thanks for a little insight into your country life, for showing us around the farm and letting us help with the animals.  Great farm stay experience that we will visit again.  Will likely see you at the Adelaide farmers market in the near future so we can pick up some more yummy produce!"

The location on a working dairy farm amongst vineyards is interesting and with the added benefits of fresh eggs, butter, milk, bacon and more! The Barossa and Eden Valleys are on your doorstep, with many excellent wineries and restaurants within a short drive. We also explored the Hale Conservation Park and the Little Kaiserstuhl Walking Track. Highly recommend."
27409837,749649387,2021-04-18,3979063,Frances,"What an absolute gem. From the delicious farm produce, super comfy beds, luxurious bed linen.....Michael has thought of everything. Wandering the farm, watching cows being milked and piglets fed and a stroll through the vines....every sense tells you you have escaped the city. A weekend Sydney getaway that will leave you feeling refreshed yet still relaxed. Treat yourself and book into the Dairyman’s Cottage."
27409837,755254456,2021-05-05,57754622,Jarl,"If we could, we'd give Michael a 6/5 for hospitality! He's an amazing person, and his farm is a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of city life."
27409837,765241993,2021-06-01,19316201,Amy,"This place was everything we had hoped for. <br/>In the middle of the Barossa Valley, but in the middle of rolling hills, quiet and peaceful, you will find this beautiful working farm, with Pigs, Cows, horses and Chickens. <br/>Michael was very welcoming, and always made sure we had everything we needed, we loved how easy going this farm was, we went with out 22 month old, and he could run around freely searching for Ruby (the dog), feeding the pigs and watching the cows get milked. <br/>We really appreciated the breakfast provisions, fresh from the farm. The bacon is the best we've had in Australia<br/>We will definitely be back. <br/>We searched high and low for a working farm stay, i would highly recommend this farm."

When we arrived the instructions were super easy and we located the place with ease. <br/>The villa itself was beautiful, with lovely linen and a stunning bathroom with an excellent spa bath. <br/>The view was spectacular and sitting out on the little deck with the local wine and cheese we collected during the day was a perfect end to the day. <br/>Amazing photo opportunities and it is so private.<br/>If you need help Nelly is happy to help but on the other hand if you like your privacy he is more than respectful of this. <br/>Would definitely recommend staying here. Perfect for a romantic couples get away and some quiet time."

The distance from the town centre is perfect and the hosts are very welcoming but not in your face. My only criticism would be that, as this is a home based condiments production business, there is some early morning noise from vehicles etc. which may annoy those who are not early risers."

27819034,457327723,2019-05-24,66314042,George,We stayed at Steve’s place for 3 nights. The accommodation was good value for money especially for a family or close friends. Very roomy and comfortable. It is more of a home industry stay than a farm stay though and is situated close to a freight route so there was some traffic noise. Close to lots of wineries and a great cycling area. Steve allowed us a late checkout which was appreciated.

The location is absolutely perfect if you want to stay in the heart of Barossa and easily reach everything around in less than 20 minutes. Nights were starry and quiet while we were sipping a glass of wine, tastings Zimmy's treats, admiring vineyards from our window.

It was lovely, close to the centre of Tanunda and easily accessible to all the highlights of the Barossa Valley. The extra touches of fresh milk, the very generous continental breakfast and the cheese and wine were really appreciated.  The enclosed private garden is a gorgeous place to sit in the morning or afternoon with the established garden. While the studio apartment is located on the same ground as the owners residential property it still felt private. Thanks Karina!"

We were able to check in early and start exploring which was amazing. The house was beautifully presented, immaculately clean and a lovely welcome note with beautiful platter, wine (which you could also buy more of), dried meats and cheese ready for us on arrival. Lovely breakfast and room amenities were all top notch. Very comfortable bed to top it all off. We will be back!"

It was immaculately clean, in the perfect location and was very stylish. We were treated to a beautiful platter on arrival with delicious cheeses, meats etc as well as a lovely bottle of wine. Check in was a breeze and Karina was very speedy in replying to messages, giving recommendations when we asked where we should have lunch. The bnb had its own private courtyard and while it was a little chilly for us to enjoy it, it would be lovely to enjoy once the weather warms up. We were pleasantly surprised by the selection of breakfast items that were available for us to enjoy, as well as fresh fruit and bread and homemade biscuits and jam. We would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get away for a couple of days, next time we would love to stay for even longer!

The place was small and cosy but had ample room and storage for clothes. <br/>The location was prefect, a little off the beaten track but still close enough to walk to local restaurants and wineries. Must add a little shout out to Langmeil Winery both staff and wines were amazing and only a 10 minute walk. If you decide to drive try"

We really appreciated all the local information and flyers available to us and I loved the flowers in the bathroom - a beautiful personal touch.  The space was cosy and comfortable. Everything was spotless and very welcoming and the courtyard garden was a mini paradise.  The birdlife in the mornings made my heart sing.  It didn't bother us that we weren't super close to the main road - the Barossa needs to be seen by car anyway so wasn't a problem at all. Would highly recommend this lovely studio.

Little touches like the grazing platter as you arrive and your choice of a delicious bottle of red or white wine from the region made all the difference. The little bunch of flowers 🌸 in the bathroom also made us smile 😊 The studio was beautifully clean with a lovely outdoor garden area to sit and enjoy the wine and food platter 🍷🍷🍷 As for the location, that was perfect too, as we were close to amazing restaurants as well as just a short drive to all the surrounding vineyards and local attractions like Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop.

The space was set up perfectly, we were a family of 5 staying (one in a port a cot) and the kids all had their own little space to retreat to and the place was lovely, new and very clean. We only stayed one night, I probably wouldn’t stay here with all my children for a week but for a couple with one or two kids it’s definitely worth the stay. They have thought of everything to make the space functional. Located in a gorgeous area of Angaston too :) thanks for the lovely stay!"

29192273,442960393,2019-04-24,4570278,Talia,"Positioned perfectly in the Barossa, just the next street over from the main street in Tanunda. We were honoured to be the first guests that Cory had in his sparkling newly renovated house with all of the mod cons. Check in was a breeze using the code keypad lock. Cory has tastefully renovated his house but it was the small things I really appreciated. Proper sized wine glasses, little Nespresso style machine with complimentary pods, Netflix(!), olive oil + balsamic in the pantry and most importantly, the amazing guest book! Perhaps the only AirBnB guest book that I've actually wanted to read and flip through. Beautifully presented with amazing information about the region and of course wine! Favourite part was the ghost stories at the back. Next level! Cory is a thoughtful and considerate host. We hope to come back for our next Barossa visit!"

Some lovely touches on arrival, including a bottle of red that went down a treat as well as a great guidebook for the area!<br/><br/>We used the local taxi service to get to some wineries and avoid the rain showers but the town is easily walkable.<br/><br/>Cory even sorted us out with a later checkout which made the last morning a lot easier!<br/><br/>Recommend Cory’s place a lot.

Our ‘home away from home’ was ideal for us, travelling with an elderly parent, who could be very particular but was very impressed. Top points for comfort and cleanliness! Close to the main road but very quiet especially at night! A short drive to the main street was also very convenient for a quick trip to the supermarket (which had it all) but also very charming town."

Wonderfully equiped kitchen and we LOVED the photo book introducing us to the area! You could tell so much time and detail was spent on it, it was so thoughtful and educational!! The beds were super comfy and the back garden was great to hang out in with a few of the local wines. Cory’s is an easy 20 min walk into the main centre of Tanunda, which we thoroughly recommend an early stroll to Apex bakery for their fresh bread! Would definitely stay at Cory’s again if we’re back in the Barossa!"

The place is as pictured and Cory has thought of nice little touches such as the mini toiletries kits for each guest AND enough toilet paper for your stay - HOORAY! <br/>Check in and check out was a breeze and we made the most of the place - even cooking up dinner one eve with local produce and watching a movie. If I’m in the Barossa again or have any friends planning on going, I wouldn’t hesitate to suggest they stay at Cory’s. It’s a stylish boutique yet homely stay."

You will find the location very near a lot of wineries and cellar doors in the town of Tanunda. My partner and I often spent time outside as the outdoor area was lit up at night and the atmosphere was serene. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this space for others. Even though, it was only my partner and I; the space accommodates for up to a party of 6. It holds everything you need for amenities from washers/dryers to a selection of cooking utensils. Once again, thank you for allowing us to use your space and will absolutely think of you for our next visit to the Barossa."

29557043,344533187,2018-11-03,47431160,Tatiana,"Nelly's place is amazing, it has all of the comfort you would expect and amazing luxuries. My husband and I spent a weekend at this place, we were seeking a relaxed and romantic base from which to explore what the Barossa has to offer. It was a fantastic experience. Communication and check in was easy, any issues had were quickly fixed.  Thank you Nelly and Guido for your warm hospitality."
29557043,444368952,2019-04-28,12274541,Claire,"I brought my husband to the Barossa as a surprise for his 30th birthday and we chose to stay at Nelly and Guido's gorgeous Country Cottage while we were visiting. We honestly could not have wished for more, the venue itself was gorgeous, overlooking vineyards with a wonderful sunrise outlook (which is a must for at least one morning of your stay) and all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay. The thing that was really outstanding though was Nelly and Guido's hospitality. The communication beforehand was seamless, early check in was no problem, the provided us with extra coffee pods when we ran out and Nelly even kindly drove us to dinner on my husband's birthday dinner at Lyndoch Hill which I think is reflective of the kind of generosity one experiences all over the Barossa. We couldn't rate our stay at the Country Cottage more highly and can't wait to visit again!<br/><br/>Regarding the location, Lyndoch is around 20 minutes from Tanundra which is the real heart of the Barossa and we did have to drive everywhere. (There are options to use some bike trails but it would have been around a 28km round trip and it would have made it difficult to carry all the wine we bought!). You can't really get around the Barossa without driving so with that in mind, I'm glad we stayed in Lyndoch rather than Tanundra because it puts you in the path of many excellent wineries including St Hallet's, Rockford, Hemera, St Hugo and many more."
29557043,456206655,2019-05-21,260373520,Christian,A beautiful cottage set in a beautiful location overlooking one of Lyndoch's beautiful vineyards! Nice and close to most wineries and restaurants. We had a great stay in May of 2019 and would definitely consider booking with Nelly again when we decided to visit the Barossa again.
29557043,511891263,2019-08-18,135172773,Joseph,My now Fiancé and I had an absolute amazing time. Perfect place for me to get down on my knee and ask that big question under the rotunda.<br/><br/>Nice and close to everything in the Barossa and definitely somewhere we will be back to enjoy. <br/><br/>Thank you again Kelly and see you soon

29557043,645439557,2020-08-02,33416216,Katina,My partner and I stayed here for a weekend away in the Barossa and we honestly could not fault our time at Nelly's cottage. The photos truly do not do it justice and our expectations were exceeded in every way! The view and location of the cottage itself were incredible. The bathroom and Spa were sparkling clean and an absolute luxury to have...Everything that you could possibly need had been thought of and provided. The bed was one of the comfiest we had both ever slept in. We would highly recommend  staying here. Nelly was an incredible host who went and above to accomodate our needs. Thank you Nelly!

Jodie was a fabulous host, providing a very welcome basket of goodies for breakfast and coffee pods for the Nespresso to get us all going! The kitchen was well stocked with crockery and pans etc so we could easily cook our own meals. We didn't use the laundry but it looked fully stocked also. The bed was really comfortable and Jodie provided plenty of pillows, cushions and extra blankets, as well as coat hangers in the wardrobes.

We all enjoyed breakfast provisions such as cereal & crumpets & orange juice.  We used the washing machine & dishwasher too which worked well.

It has beautiful grounds in the heart of Barossa valley. For a home built in 1800’s it has updated appliances and is very roomy and the furnishings reflect the history of the home. Jonathan was quick to respond to our questions and we really enjoyed our stay.
29783445,402876485,2019-01-19,42952204,Tamara,What a lovely cottage thourly enjoyed our stay. <br/>Only a 10 min walk into town.

29783445,431440249,2019-04-01,64676978,Jonathan,Very cute little cottage deep in the Barossa. Thoroughly enjoyed our time there.
29783445,436341959,2019-04-13,11184993,Ryan,"We had a wonderful stay. The house was very clean and there were many small touches. Our kids enjoyed playing in the garden and it was enjoyable having a drink out the back in the afternoon. As the front of the house borders the footpath, there can be a little traffic noise in the front room."
29783445,438927536,2019-04-18,122248237,David,We highly recommend Figtree Cottage if you are looking to stay in the Barossa. The cottage is very clean with lovely touches. The cottage garden is very well kept and has beautiful autumn colours in April.
29783445,448191063,2019-05-05,126572098,Melanie,"This is a lovely place, with comfortable beds, a lovely garden, and a great array of cooking implements. However it was not worth the price and had a number of issues; including mice, no working fireplace (the only reason I even got the place) and some practical issues (like bedroom doors that didn’t close, no hanging spaces, and no full length mirror). I couldn’t say I’d recommend the place - at least at this price or until they get rid of the mice."
29783445,459156067,2019-05-27,64015803,Bailey,"We spent two days in Angaston and thoroughly enjoyed our time at Fig tree cottage, it was lovely and cosy , the beds were comfortable and the garden was beautiful.

29783445,500912184,2019-08-03,167107075,Sandra,"Centrally located, Figtree Cottage was a lovely venue from which to explore the beautiful Barossa Valley."
29783445,535240682,2019-09-24,23153109,Linda,"A good location for touring in the Barossa, it has off street parking.  The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen fairly recently updated, the bedrooms are lacking in storage and probably better suited to shorter stays for couples without too much luggage. <br/><br/>The cottage is old and historic with a pretty garden, it would be ideal for sitting outside on warm days and there are lots of places nearby to eat, although some a little pricey we found.  We enjoyed our cooking course at Casa Carboni and bought fresh local cheeses  next door to enjoy with some Barossa reds."
29783445,542977440,2019-10-07,242199323,Marlise,This quaint and homely little cottage was incredible.

The wood fire was amazing and kept the lounge room and main bedroom warm over night. We loved the historic charm of the place, and the bath and shower were both really nice (the shower has a great water pressure, which I appreciate). Angaston is also a great spot which is close to heaps of good places to eat. This place has everything you need for a cosy weekend away!"
29783445,650685148,2020-08-14,117828099,Ellysa,"Lovely little cottage on the Main Street of Angaston. Was a little loud in the morning as cars/trucks frequent the area, but was a good wake up call!

We had lots of fires in the sitting room and there were oil heaters to keep us warm . <br/>Cute and quirky this place is furnished with vintage pieces with clean heritage style kitchen and bathroom. There are pretty views out of every window and the gardens are beautiful.

29783445,663461740,2020-09-13,12486140,Michelle,"Jonathan and Kate's house is a beautiful, old cottage with a gorgeous little garden out the back - we spent many happy hours picnicking in the backyard with wine and produce bought in the region. The fireplace was also lovely for the cool nights in early Spring. The mattresses were particularly comfortable. The cottage is located on the main street in Angaston, so was just a short walk to nearby restaurants and shops. Overall we had a lovely time staying here."
29783445,667922908,2020-09-26,45255174,Melanie,Fig Tree Cottage gives the visitor a wonderful experience of the Barossa with a sense of being immersed in its history but with all the modern comforts.

29783445,713044629,2020-12-02,16547582,Bryney,"Great little cottage in Angaston. Short walk to great coffee and food! Great breakfast supplies, plenty of tea and a coffee pod machine.  Very comfortable beds. If planning a trip to Angaston or the Barossa this lovely cottage is the place to stay. Jonathon a great host, attentive via messaging."
29783445,720280482,2021-01-01,73132147,Erica,"Beautiful cottage with a wonderful secluded garden.  Great hosts providing thoughtful touches, good supplies and kept in touch throughout to ask if anything needed.  Comfy beds, fluffy towels, good kitchen to cook in and great shower.  We stayed a week and can recommend a longer stay here to see the area.  Fabulous stay!"
29783445,721246962,2021-01-03,101562685,Lucy,Jonathan and Kate’s place is the perfect place to enjoy the Barossa. The cottage was tidy and charming with the extra touches that make a stay special. Would definitely come back.

29783445,736178374,2021-03-04,92234384,Cindy,"Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the cottage. It is stylish and light filled-exactly what I want my holiday home or retirement cottage to look like (insert heart eye emoji here). It has everything you need if you’re staying in the Barossa for while (drying rack, washing machine etc). Kate and Jonathan were always just a message away if you need anything. Highly recommend!"
29783445,738193146,2021-03-12,34543886,Jane,"Fig Tree Cottage was a perfect place to base ourselves whilst we were doing some work in the Barossa. It is stylish and practical, very comfortable and spacious. We loved all its period features. And that garden! Sitting under the big tree having lunch one day was my idea of perfection; cool, green, lots of birds visiting. Fabulous! The light-filled bathroom is gorgeous. Having a washing machine is always a bonus when you're travelling for a while. Internet connection was very good. What a wonderful place to stay for work - or a holiday! We hope to return. Thank you so much Kate and Jonathan. Cheers!"
29783445,740814852,2021-03-21,33334049,Katie,"Lovely and sweet little cottage on the edge of town, walkable to most including the cheese company, wine bar, cafe and a nice little park. <br/><br/>Cosy with a good kitchen for a short stay, and a beautiful garden with a fig tree!"

It has comfortable beds, nice bathroom and convenient washing machine.  We found the check in quick, simple and convenient.  A great location to walk into Angaston and explore the Barossa.  We were able to cook our own meals or walk into the restaurant / cafes in town. Recommended for a Barossa experience."

29783445,753837859,2021-05-02,145302436,Bronwyn,"We recently stayed here for a short stay for 2 nights, the Fig Tree Cottage was very comfortable, close to everything you need, Jonathon and Kate were great hosts, going above for us to make our stay extra special.

29783445,758198653,2021-05-15,103389010,Hannah,"Such a beautiful, charming cottage. It was really clean, cosy and had everything that you would need for a short stay.<br/>It was nice to stay somewhere that was walking distance to coffee/cafes but also short driving distance to all of the wineries/restaurants.<br/>Lots of little table set ups and garden spots for cheese and wine."
29783445,759418018,2021-05-17,99570429,Catherine,Very cute little cottage in the middle of Angaston. 5-10 mins away from closest wineries and a 5 min walk to cafes and local grocery store. Would definitely stay again.

29783445,395935255109510100,2021-06-30,145459704,Joanne,"We love our stay in the cottage. We were warm and snug each night despite the low temperatures. We used the reverse cycle air-con the first night and the fireplace the second night. Two double lounges with throw rugs meant we could stretch out in the evenings. The bed was very comfortable. We cooked dinner both nights and found all the kitchen utensils we needed. Dishwasher made clean up easy. We did two loads of washing but did struggle to get it dry as the air was so cold during the day. Plenty of hot water for the shower but I wasn’t a fan of the shower over the free standing bath as I have balance issues. Overall, a great place to stay as a couple."
29783445,401716577617591446,2021-07-08,68997363,Sarah,"Cute little heritage cottage within easy waking distance of shops in the main street of Angaston. <br/>Beds were very comfy, and heating good with a split system and portable units. The garden is lovely, overlooking a hill with sheep at the back. <br/><br/>About a kilometre or so out of town is a restaurant called Vintners(fine dining experience), and we decided to have dinner there one night. It was absolutely the best meal we had on our SA holiday. Amazing food and service! <br/><br/>The house is directly located on the main street and road noise is heard in front bedroom. It didn’t bother us particularly, being winter, all windows and doors were closed. Possibly a small note to consider for some, in warmer months."
29783445,423487064311972658,2021-08-07,129545703,Emily,I can’t fault this cute cottage! We absolutely loved our stay and will definitely be back!

29783445,445140681576770945,2021-09-06,12713774,Lisa,My husband and I spent four days in gorgeous Fig Tree Cottage.  The cottage is located in a great area - close to lots of nice wineries and not far from the restaurants etc in Angaston's main street.  Originally our booking was for four people - which would have been fine - but with just the two of us it gave us a bit of extra room to spread out.  The cottage is beautifully furnished wand was well equipped with lots of heating options which came in handy during a rather cold spell!.
29783445,450221223542848317,2021-09-13,20202773,Gillian,"Gorgeous getaway, convenient location to cycling, wineries & cafes. Helpful & flexible hosts, enjoyable & relaxing stay!"

29975093,427099373,2019-03-23,121918627,Leeanne,Gorgeous and quaint cottage very well located walking distance to everything.
29975093,432414129,2019-04-03,129811770,Kate,"If you want something a little left of centre then this is the place for you. So well appointed with lots of thoughtful little extras. Comfortable, clean and quirky. The second bedroom is a thoroughfare to the lounge and the place is on the Main Street so at peak times there is vehicle noise. Neither of these points would hinder us staying again as the good definitely outweighed any negative."
29975093,436775123,2019-04-14,141476944,Ann,A great location in a very historic cottage and town. Old world charm with every modern convenience. Lots of room and every comfort for the weary traveller.

29975093,482769587,2019-07-07,15069841,Sophie,"Cute home. Great location, walked to the brew house down the road.  Lovely breakfasts supplied. I would say if you were staying with 4 people that one bedroom you have to travel between the living room and the kitchen so the other guests would have to walk through. I wouldn’t like that myself. Thanks for the great stay."
29975093,510308616,2019-08-16,114248936,Terryl,"Huge cottage, comfy bed, large kitchen & bath. Clean, beautiful linens. Great location to explore Barossa. Best breakfast, snacks AND WINE!!!! Great hosts!"

The location was perfect, we could walk into the main shopping area of Tanunda within two minutes and were perfectly situated to explore all parts of the Barossa. Mark and Tanya were very thoughtful and left a lovely hamper for us. Would definitely recommend Johann’s Cottage to anyone who is visiting the Barossa Valley."
29975093,540665508,2019-10-04,158885245,Daniel,"Tanya & Mark’s place is perfect for checking out the Barossa. It’s a short walk to the Main Street and makes it easy to drive to different wineries. Being on the main road however, you do get the traffic noise.<br/><br/>They are very generous hosts, giving us a gift basket and bottle of wine to enjoy as well as easy to communicate with. After locking ourselves out of the house, they were very kind and dropped off a spare set for us to get back in, thanks again Mark and Tanya."
29975093,552075336,2019-10-20,23198926,Emily,Great location to get you everywhere you need to go in the Barossa. The breakfast laid out is a life saver after a full day of wine tastings. The shower is a little hard for taller people (like myself) to get around. Tanya & Mark gave great recommendations for the location which were super helpful! Thanks again!
29975093,561713776,2019-11-09,57186449,Maggie,"Tanya & Mark have created a very comfortable and stylish accommodation at Johann's Cottage. This place is very well-located, beautifully furnished and sparkling clean. Highly recommended."

The location is perfect, walking distance to everything in Tanunda. The bed and pillows are super comfortable, so important for a restful vacation. Expect traffic noise during the day, as you are right on the main road, but lovely and quiet at night, not disturbed at all!! So many helpful brochures and information included in the house, loads of reading and games to entertain yourself. A very lovely place to stay, highly recommended. Thanks Tanya and Mark"

29975093,668265624,2020-09-27,326623542,Nichola,"The hosts have thought of everything regarding personal touches. There were cereals, snacks, water, milk and a bottle of wine with a personal message as it was my Birthday 😊.The cottage is located on the main road which makes it easy to access all the amenities but it can be a little noisy especially on Sunday mornings with the church bells from the local churches. The cottage was clean and tidy  but some of the facilities were  a bit dated."
29975093,671413884,2020-10-05,317008758,Kim,Lovely spot.  Very convenient for shops and restaurants in Tanunda.  Lovely extra touches from the hosts.  Cottage was built in 1860 and had a great charm about it.

29975093,721238083,2021-01-03,256980793,Alyssa,"This quaint little cottage would be perfect for those looking to soak up some history in the Barossa. It’s a lovely little place with antique furniture throughout but lacked a few of the modern creature comforts we’ve come to rely on. For example, there isn’t wifi (it’s our own fault for not checking this beforehand), it was very warm in the house in the middle of summer and unfortunately the single air conditioning unit didn’t quite cut it, there aren’t powerpoints where you might expect, like by both beds (as we’ve come to rely on for phone charging unfortunately) and the shower was quite average (especially for my 6’3” husband). These small things won’t matter to everyone so I’m sure many will still love their stay here."
29975093,722913987,2021-01-09,47308317,Leonie,"Lovely cottage within easy walking distance to cafes and restaurants.  Beautifully furnished with period furniture right down to old photographs.  Plenty of good reading material on hand.  It was generously stocked with all you need, even a picnic hamper!  Would recommend the cottage to anyone planning a visit to the Barossa. Mark & Tanya are generous hosts."
29975093,724722523,2021-01-16,231025113,Dale,"Fabulous central location. Interesting and comfortable home and generous hosts who leave a basket of treats to enjoy. In the height of summer the air-conditioner struggled to stretch to the second bedroom but there is a fan available. Be mindful that the shower is over the bath and there are small steps throughout the house, but if you mobility is good, you'll enjoy this beautifully furnished home."
29975093,737434127,2021-03-08,56862112,Paul,Johan's Cottage is a great place to stay if you are visiting the Barossa.  It is located in Taunda and in walking distance of the centre of the village and the restaurants.<br/><br/>It fits beautifully into the late 19th Century vibe and is furnished very comfortably with lots of furniture pieces from the late 1900's<br/><br/>Both bedrooms are very comfortable and a good size with comfortable beds.<br/><br/>There are two sitting rooms which are comfortable and a good size well equipped kitchen.<br/><br/>Off street parking makes life easy as well<br/><br/>Overall a great place to stay and I would certainly come back

29975093,768227205,2021-06-09,1852912,Kathryn,We enjoyed our stay and loved the extra items that were stocked for us  but as we stayed during a very cold wet time we found the air conditioner a bit inadequate to warm the entire cottage .

29975093,495199731540495716,2021-11-14,45124734,Tamara,"Let's start with the pro's: incredible location, you can walk to restaurants, wine bars, even a cellar is within walking distance. The beds are wonderful, SO comfortable. The owners are abundantly generous in what they leave you in terms on snacks and drinks-you would never find this elsewhere! Brilliant value for money.<br/><br/>Cons- the caretaker lives next door, my mum and I were returning home and she opened the door at the adjacent apartment and watched us every time we arrived and left the property. It made us feel SO uncomfortable, like we were being stalked (it was truly horrid) and made us feel a bit unsafe. At one point she asked us if we were okay.....code for be quiet at 9pm on a Friday evening. Realistically how loud could a 37 year old and 55 year old professional women be? utterly ridiculous!<br/><br/>The layout of the property is highly unusual. You can't access the front door without going through somebody's bedroom. It is rather awkward. There is only heating in the front lounge area. The back bedroom and kitchen area is heated by a small transportable heater. It would be particularly hard to keep warm in winter.<br/><br/>Please note, no Wi-Fi, Netflix, and the host has only a very small outdated TV, that said, who spends time at home in the barossa?<br/><br/>This property would suit a mature couple, ready to explore the wine region, spending minimal time in the property."
29975093,502349895519807220,2021-11-23,12973682,Paul,Conveniently located and well provisioned historical cottage

The house has been thoughtfully decorated and each item on display is a time piece sharing a story. The house was well stocked up with supplies and made our stay a delightful experience.<br/>The cottage is on the main street and is walking distance to restaurants, bars and cafe's. Ample parking and nothing to worry.<br/>One call out, the house has only one Aircon and is in the first living; rest of the house gets really hot if the temperatures are soaring beyond 30 degrees."

Loved everything about this place - could not have asked for more, from the yummy breakfast provisions, wine,cookies.... to the super comfortable bed and amazing shower. Even the outhouse toilet was luxurious. Everything was truly perfect - and I’m very fussy! I loved it so much I extended an extra 2 nights and lucky for me it was available - hope to be back one day"

30094352,533615199106196779,2022-01-06,13254825,Marilyn,The best B&B ever!  We absolutely loved this charming early settlers cottage fitted out with all the mod cons. This cottage has loads of character and has been lovingly restored with attention to detail that way exceeded our expectations. Plus all the thoughtful extras added up to a truly authentic Barossa experience that made for a most memorable stay.
30094352,535693817727994671,2022-01-08,2975902,Greg,"Mike & Sue’s ‘Rusty Olive’ cottage is beautifully restored and presented and a great place to stay. All the little extras provided are thoughtful additions and much appreciated, and will simply enhance your stay - the welcome bottle of wine, breakfast (first day) and all the ‘home’ supplies you could possibly need.<br/>This little Angaston gem is centrally located in the Barossa and only mini away from anywhere you might want to visit."
30724902,400671172,2019-01-12,60823741,Dannielle,"A gorgeously quaint cottage right in the middle of the vineyards. Sybelle was an excellent host, with quick communication and the home was spotlessly clean. Excellent value for money and a terrific location to use as a base for exploring the Barossa Valley."

30724902,418753157,2019-03-03,47243731,Roger,Very nice historical house. Quiet location with beautiful scenery. No air conditioner and really hot weather but the fans provided did help.

30724902,433642847,2019-04-07,30402614,Bethany,The cutest cottage in a picture perfect location
30724902,436762367,2019-04-13,88227417,Sarah,Very suitable location that is close to wineries. house gets cold at night however there are small heaters. Good value for money. Lots of brochures and information available for the Barossa valley. Continental breakfast items supplied.

30724902,442178189,2019-04-23,11086535,Nadine,"The farmhouse was just as gorgeous as the pictures. It was great to stay outside of town in the peaceful Light Pass. Very close to major towns, and lots to do in the area. Sibylle left great instructions for making the best use of the house. Vineyards in the backyard are very picturesque! We stayed for two nights, but could easily see ourselves living in the area."
30724902,444343034,2019-04-27,244074717,Andre,"As my first AirBnB experience, Petra's House was a fantastic surprise. Surrounded by vineyards and staying in an original 1910 house was a great way to immerse ourselves in the Barossa state of mind. The house was spotless and we got some belated easter eggs as a welcome. If you like wine, and peace & quiet, this is a great option."
30724902,447522984,2019-05-04,9985887,Kath,This little cottage is very quaint and brought back lots of memories for my husband of his grandma’s house in regional Victoria. It was cold but there were plenty of heaters around the house. The bed was good and the feather doona was adequate overnight. The other facilities - kitchen and bathroom were basic but in keeping with the style of the cottage. It was a good location for our needs and a great stay overall.
30724902,451459227,2019-05-12,8996033,Andrea,We had a great overnight stay in Sibylle's quirky cottage. It was the perfect base for our family of four to explore the Barossa.
30724902,454241378,2019-05-18,125468850,Jane,"Lovely historic cottage in a central location away from the main road, old world charm with comfy beds.  Sybille is a thoughtful host, we didn't meet but would choose to stay again."
30724902,458357250,2019-05-26,38307729,Emma,Petras house is a beautifully maintained old style house. The beds are wonderfully comfortable and it is set in a peaceful location.
30724902,467010892,2019-06-10,131418318,Gary,"🔷️ cosy, eclectic little home<br/>HOWEVER ..<br/><br/>￭ the inadequate Heating ( fan heater FAILED dismally to heat the rooms with 11'6"" ceiling height)<br/>￭ the faulty electrical WIRING.. fuses tripping all the time when using fan Heaters & fuses over-Heating. I got a zap when checking one of the fuses on one occasion.<br/>- fuses are 16Amp so is dangerous to use more than one heater per circuit. This meant that for safety one needed to turn off the 12Amp fan heater if using toaster or jug. It was also dangerous to try to use a fan heater in kitchen & Lounge at the same time (24A LOAD against 16A fuse). The expectation to manipulate appliances to avoid tripping the fuses was LESS than satisfactory. <br/>🔴This house in its current state is unsatisfactory for RENTAL purposes. Additionally there is INADEQUATE / LACK OF heating or cooling ( not even a ceiling fan).<br/>￭ No thermal bedding even though the booking was was in mid-winter. <br/>￭ Crockery & Cutlery appeared to have been OpShop leftovers & was NOT up to standard .. some items are chipped (hygiene issue). Only 3 plates so had to eat in shifts.<br/>￭ Cooking utensils are old & need replacing .. hygiene issue<br/>￭ HWS was inadequate for 4 adults<br/>￭ Washing machine was NOT working.<br/>￭ No axe provided to cut firewood to length ... had to resort to brute strength to break it up<br/>￭ No broom/ mop provided in case we needed to clean up ?<br/>￭ Only ONE key provided even though it was clear that 2 couples would be using the house."
30724902,474177288,2019-06-23,21068691,Anne,"A lovely house with period correct finishings, bringing back memories of the golden ages of yesteryears. <br/><br/>Sibylle was easy to communicate with, check in was easy, and some breakfast food and drinks were provided, which is a very nice touch!<br/><br/>If you do visit in winter however, bring extra thick indoor clothing along as the place is cold; there are only two small heaters."
30724902,477227518,2019-06-28,77398283,Sam,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this gorgeous, quaint country house. It was in a fantastic location to explore and enjoy the Barossa Valley, and we especially loved the peace and quiet it offered.

30724902,480490727,2019-07-03,152139672,Ann,"A quaint house set in the vineyards - a true South Australian representation of yesteryear, with interesting little treasures and nick knacks. <br/>Nice personal hand written notes about where items are located in the house, how the taps work etc. <br/>We stayed mid-winter and the place was FREEZING. There are 2 small electric heaters which, together, heat a single room.   We wore coats and wrapped in blankets to keep warm."

30724902,542973187,2019-10-06,261959890,Debi,Petra’s house was cosy and well placed to visit all areas in the Barossa. Very generous with breakfast foods. Having Willows Wines next door was an added bonus . We would highly recommend staying there.<br/>Debi and Darren.
30724902,548768572,2019-10-18,129935307,Bernadine,"The house has character & love and is comfortable throughout. Loved that it was spotlessly clean. Ample light switches and beautiful, peaceful surrounding grounds that the house stands on. A pure pleasure of serenity to enjoy. Sibylle's extra touches with the food provided for breakfast was much appreciated and enjoyed. We could have easily stayed for a week not just overnight!"

It is set in a relaxed rural community right in the Barossa. Access to explore the many vineyards is right at the door step. A most enjoyable place to stay.

30724902,598390768,2020-01-27,63196820,Sharon,We were satisfied with Petras place. The location great for local wineries & to sit on the front porch. The beds were average & boiling your own rainwater was recommended but otherwise it was a lovely stay and great value.
30724902,602454107,2020-02-06,177106811,Nicole,Beautiful surrounds and amazing hospitality from Sibylle! Complimentary bottle of Riesling from neighbouring winery went down a treat on the cottage verandah.

Thanks again and we will be back🍷

Check in with easy and hassle-free with Sibylle being prompt with her communication and explaining everything clearly. She was so thoughtful with all the goodies left out for breakfast for us, and provided more than enough linen, towels and blankets. Although it was a very cold night, the heater did the trick very nicely! Definitely would stay again!"

30724902,388704661009413894,2021-06-20,3712602,Petra,"A beautiful piece of history among the vineyards of the Barossa but with the comfort of central heating. We found a well equipped kitchen and a lovely welcome pack of walnuts from the garden’s orchid, fresh local bred, milk, jus and jams. The trip to the nearest local town is a 5 minute car drive and the awesome family run Willows winery is right next door.  I highly recommend a stay at Petra’s house."

30724902,403842966455928786,2021-07-11,5024908,Toni,"Overpriced and underwhelmed <br/>We were expecting a quaint cottage experience but this wasn’t it. <br/>We chose Petras Place due to its location. The cottage was the exact replica of my grandparent's house that they left over 40 years ago. Unfortunately, it looked like my grandparents had just walked out the door and left it as is. <br/>Firstly we booked the entire house, as it was advertised on Airbnb. There were only two of us but we require separate beds as one of us snores. The second bed was not made up and there was no linen for us to make it up. <br/>The fit-out of the cottage was such that it looked like the linen, bath towels, crockery and cutlery was the collection your Mum put together for you when you first left home, old and poor quality. It was also very interestingly decorated with torn-off pictures from calendars stuck around the place. <br/>The house was freezing cold and while there was a heater/cooler system (not central heating as noted by the host) it only serviced the four main rooms. It was also set to a 4-hour cycle so it turned off in the middle of the night in a very cold Barossa winter. <br/>The laundry and bathroom areas were frigidly cold, not helped by the cement floors and the heating didn’t extend to these areas. <br/>The lounge, in the only reception area, was old and lumpy and was not comfortable to sit on. <br/>The bathroom was very poor standard and you were unable to use the mirror to shave or apply makeup due to its poor placement. <br/>We were glad to leave and won’t be going back."
30724902,408952851349487522,2021-07-18,405543678,Steven,"Very cosy historic house in a great location, easy access to all the attractions of Barossa and with beautiful vineyards to wake up to. Enjoyed our stay very much!"

30724902,464722829525134197,2021-10-03,243224219,Carolyn,The house was quaint & old. Some decor could be better. The quilt in bedroom two was too small for the bed and a top sheet would have been good. Otherwise it was a nice stay. Lovely garden & surrounding vineyards.
30724902,474140568228637244,2021-10-16,422969482,Brittney,"Lovely place to stay, close to all the wineries we wanted to go to and Sibylle was lovely to communicate with!"
30724902,479221042971154774,2021-10-23,30688655,Shane,"This is a lovely home with a beautifully kept cottage garden set amongst grapevines.<br/>Sybille has some unique special touches including fresh flowers from the garden, and a moreish German treat, stollen bites, to welcome you. Luhr's cottage, 1km south, is a heritage gem well worth a visit."

30724902,535800099936704608,2022-01-09,2080857,Glen,Comfortable and spacious with all you need plus a lovely welcome package on arrival. The only distraction from the great location is the somewhat old furnishings and the daggy decor.
31336642,557840901,2019-11-02,305156230,Max,The ambiance of this place is amazing. I slept like a log.
31336642,568018725,2019-11-23,10977428,Phillip,So many thoughtful touches in this place and wonderfully quiet. A place to really get away from things.
31336642,577021547,2019-12-14,162641101,Brittany,"Had a lovely stay for our anniversary, very clean and and spacious for two, great breakfast and warm hospitality from Evelyn"
31336642,582419367,2019-12-27,86942448,Jacob,"We had a brilliant one night getaway at Evelyns place. The unit is exceptionally clean, well furnished and comfortable. We stayed on a mid-30s day and the aircon was nice and cool. Views and surroundings are fantastic."

31336642,614995677,2020-03-07,9131813,Debbie,"Evelyn’s guest suite ticks all of th boxes! She has created a beautiful guest quarters in her new home that is stylish and spacious, comfortable,  and convenient to the many wineries and nearby small towns. Located in the countryside, there is peace and birdsong. She provided a wide selection of breakfast items, including eggs and bacon, honey from her hives, and other homemade items to round out a lovely breakfast. After two months traveling, her place ranked in the top three of our many Airbnbs. We highly recommend if you are thinking of visiting the Eden and Barossa Valleys!"
31336642,616166341,2020-03-09,309882201,Leonie,"Homely, clean and comfortable and Evelyn is very friendly and welcoming.<br/>Thoroughly recommended!"
31336642,618226488,2020-03-15,70726235,Leah,"The thought and care put into little touches around the place, like fresh flowers and produce, for example, make this space feel loving and cosy while being super clean, fresh and modern at the same time.<br/><br/>Evelyn asked ahead of time of any dietary requirements so I could happily get stuck in to all the treats provided, knowing my allergy had been considered.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this spot to any couples or singles in need of an escape to take a breath, Meander is perfect."
31336642,624355965,2020-05-10,287056285,Alanah,The place was beautiful! Nice and cosy winter nights with a hot tea was bliss 🥰. Beautiful scenery with lots of animals around. Evelyn had out done herself with the homemade products. Nothing better! Loved how she used the space with wooden furniture with touches or green and blue around.
31336642,626282801,2020-05-26,2434750,Barbara,This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a warm welcome. We used Meander Retreat as a base for walking the Lavender Federation Trail. Perfect retreat after a day's hiking! Evelyn is a fabulous host.
31336642,628415796,2020-06-08,87922674,Stephan,"We could not have imagined a better Winter stay - stunning accommodation, great breakfast, and the most lovely host. Evelyn made sure we had what we needed to fully relax and culminated with a bonfire and a bowl of yummy chocolate pudding. We were spoilt and will come back very soon! Thank you - best experience we’ve had in a long time."
31336642,632678944,2020-06-27,129056477,Christina,This is a beautiful property and a very stylish studio. It’s the perfect location to explore the Barossa/Hills and get some country air. We highly recommend this stay.
31336642,635281067,2020-07-06,119902528,Paul,"Lovely spot on the edge of the Barossa. Evelyn is a great host, unobtrusive but attentive. Super clean, nice Asian decor touches, really warm in the winter, high ceilings and roomy. Chooks, veges, fruit in season and modern kitchen for own cooking. Lost an hour in the big bath after canoeing and walking around Warren Reservoir."
31336642,642459703,2020-07-26,27871156,Evgeny,We have really enjoyed our stay. We will definitely recommend this place and will be back one day ourselves.
31336642,646104738,2020-08-02,2434750,Barbara,"We had a great time staying at Meander. We love the house and the location. Evelyn is a very thoughtful and generous host. This was our second stay at Meander. We really enjoyed the extra trouble Evelyn went to - bonfire, after dinner drinks, the wood oven pizza. The location is perfect for exploring the Barossa wineries and walking the Lavender Trail. We look forward to another visit in the future."
31336642,649229767,2020-08-10,97431100,Peter,Thanks Evelyn for a wonderful stay at your sparking cleaning retreat.  We enjoyed our stay in the quite Springton fields with the rolling hills and with the Barossa just down the road.   Peter & Prue

31336642,740468652,2021-03-20,166713533,Shannon,"What a peaceful and relaxing spot! We loved every part of our stay from adventuring around the property, being greeted by doggo and chickens, relaxing with a wine under the gums and the amazing facilities. Evelyn is a lovely host who will make sure you’re well looked after but have your own space. She puts so many lovely touches into the property and we really enjoyed making our breakfast with local produce! Easy adventuring into the Barossa by car. Thank you again!"
31336642,745864951,2021-04-05,282289081,Elissa,"We loved our stay here over Easter. Evelyn is a lovely host and made us feel very welcome. the homemade bread and breakfast supplies were very much appreciated. I loved spending some time in the hammock with a local wine, under the gums, watching the orange butterflies against the blue sky in the breeze.  I can wholeheartedly recommend staying here!"
31336642,763547797,2021-05-29,39703689,Bianca,Definitely you won’t regret to stay in this lovely place! The place is amazing! The host thinks about the smallest details that make the stay even more special! We loved so much everything!
31336642,764594720,2021-05-31,3174273,Carolina,"Evelyn's property is absolutely heavenly! The location is superb and the love and care she puts into running her business is revealed in every detail of her spotless place. It was amazing to be able to enjoy a glimpse of the country life, especially the delights she offers such as the honey, the jam and the fresh eggs all produced locally in her property. I highly recommend her place and I would easily go back for another restorative stay."
31336642,448055238356229564,2021-09-10,91604975,Daniel,"Our stay at Evelyn’s was fantastic. She was so welcoming and her place feels so homely and secluded, we didn’t want to leave! From the little touches around the supplied baked bread and eggs from her chickens to her warm welcoming and hospitality I couldn’t recommend this getaway highly enough."
31336642,450217240295897238,2021-09-13,35033509,Chanel,"It was exactly what we wanted. Peace and quiet, away from our busy lives. Clean and spacious. My personal favourite part was he bath, I spent hours soaking in it. Meander cottage was super easy to find and check in was a breeze!"
31336642,465452971956303990,2021-10-04,233433678,Erren,A fantastic and stylish stay in Springton! Evelyn is such a lovely host and her property is lovely. Her garden is beautiful and if you are keen on fully using the kitchen the vegetables and herbs that Evelyn offers add a wonderful touch to any meal.
31336642,485001276674527218,2021-10-31,207452936,Heidi,"Lovely clean,  new space in a gorgeous part of SA. We really enjoyed the king bed, soft sheets, deep bath,  modern shower, fresh produce & 11am checkout!<br/>Just a heads up for the nudists out there & those going away for a 'romantic' occasion - the suite is attached to the main residence & there is an internal door between the two rooms,  which is locked but we found a little unsettling 😉<br/>Thanks for a lovely stay Evelyn."
31336642,533581781578542869,2022-01-05,2120763,Eduardo,"A cute and comfortable little place to stay in the Barossa. Super quiet if you wanted to chill for the day like we did. Lovely orchard full of different fruit trees and veggies growing, sweet little doggy that liked to be in your company and a great big bath if you fancy a treat! We loved our stay, it was just what we needed<br/> Thank you Evelyn."
31364857,410902622,2019-02-10,36250545,Margaret,A beautiful cosy stylish retreat for 2. Enjoyed spa and outdoor  area. Great hosts.

31364857,415909905,2019-02-23,92242742,Jordan,"Lindsay and Anne Marie were very friendly hosts. A great little<br/>Place to stay for a weekend in the Barossa. Clean, comfortable and the spa was an added bonus. Look forward to a beer with Lindsay when we are next in the region."

31364857,421587108,2019-03-09,2205186,Chiraag,"We loved staying at Lindsay's apartment. It was beautifully decorated with lots of thoughtful touches. The shower, outdoor spa and kitchen were highlights, as well as the lovely bottle of wine on arrival. The location is perfect for exploring the Barossa too.<br/><br/>Highly recommended!"
31364857,423349277,2019-03-13,91680853,Vincent,"You'll enjoy a nice stay in the Barossa Valley. Nice and comfortable place, good location, friendly owners."
31364857,424534534,2019-03-17,151486970,Lindsay,Nice little studio apartment in good location. Lots of pretty decorations and furnishings. Plenty of room for two people with a nice outdoor sitting area too.

31364857,438912539,2019-04-18,130199678,Michaelia,Studio 57 is a beautiful spot to stay and explore the Barossa. The location was perfect and the hosts were very helpful. The studio contains absolutely everything you need and is very comfortable. We didn’t want to leave!
31364857,440430104,2019-04-20,169785035,Shane,"clean, everything a couple would need, great hosts, very friendly."
31364857,442583764,2019-04-23,135359470,Dominic,"Sparkling clean and beautiful. Better described as an up-market granny flat though, they've made every effort to make it private and have done very well. Just something for people to be aware of :)"
31364857,444344225,2019-04-27,150671842,Mark And Sarah,Beautiful hosts and accommodation with everything you need. Spa was a special treat. Easy walk to main street of Tanunda. Also several wineries withing walking distance. Highly recommended!

31364857,459137544,2019-05-27,143659123,Josh,"Murnane's Studio 57 is very well equipped for a weekend away in the Barossa, either using it as a bedtime base or having some quiet time at the Studio. It is warm and cozy, very well set up, and aesthetically very lovely too."
31364857,466015967,2019-06-08,63460787,Allan,"The studio was spotlessly clean, well provisioned, modern and with everything working. It was perfect for our needs as a base from which to ride the Barossa Cycling trail. It's tastefully furnished,  comfortable and relaxing, in a quiet location. The wine and chocolate were most appreciated. Thank you, we recommend it very highly and would stay again!"
31364857,470099159,2019-06-16,227867891,Stacay-Ann,"For us this was just a stunning studio in a perfect spot for visiting some local wineries. From the moment we checked in we were greeted and given some tips on local places to eat and drink, the amenities and extra touches exceeded any expectations I could have had, and the studio itself was clean and modern and just perfect for a few nights away. I can't think of anything that could be done better at this spot and I would definitely stay again on another trip to the barossa."
31364857,477767085,2019-06-29,261321309,Emma,This is a great place to stay if you want to explore the wineries of the area. The place was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our short break here.
31364857,480039917,2019-07-02,166719785,Sacha,Had the a fantastic 2 days away in this perfect little apartment. Had full ambition to go out and enjoy culinary delights of local restaurants and bars for days but felt much more comfortable staying in and in joying the unique atmosphere this little place had to offer !
31364857,482698992,2019-07-06,238641083,Jill,"Sparkling clean studio bedroom with all the amenities of a hotel and lots of little thoughtful touches such as local wine, chocolate, milk. Would definitely stay again."
31364857,488339914,2019-07-15,99437462,Natalie,Very comfortable and clean with amazing hospitality. Excellent value for money in ideal location
31364857,490018923,2019-07-18,101593877,Megan,"This air bnb was amazing! So much better than expected, the room is so  big - it’s like a self contained unit! So warm and comfortable. The host was lovely and took us to some wineries for a far cheaper price than a taxi! Perfect place for a little weekend escape from the city and the location is fantastic to get to all the local wineries. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will be back :)"
31364857,494186255,2019-07-24,135790670,Ross & Jo,"Lindsay and Annemaree were lovely hosts ! 'Studio 57' offered a cosy and luxurious little hide away to unwind and relax in for a couple of days with all the amenities one could ask for. The wine, chocolate, newspaper and bath robes were just some of the special little touches."
31364857,496818911,2019-07-28,165536063,Jess,"We stayed here as part of a weekend in the Barossa, and it didn’t disappoint! You are sooo close to everywhere you could possibly want to visit. The space is lovely and very very clean! We were just shocked by how close the Airbnb was to the owners house, as it is not part of the description! Overall we had a lovely stay."
31364857,501599152,2019-08-04,86783773,Tracey,"Very Clean and spacious, everything you need and perfectly decorated, areas inside and out to sit and relax, close to the main road if you like walking or a $10 taxi ride to most places"
31364857,504567195,2019-08-08,114712810,Robert,Unfortunately we couldn’t wait to leave. Lindsay entered the unit on three separate occasions during our stay and only had the courtesy to let us know the once. This made us feel uneasy from the very start of our stay. <br/>I also cancelled a wine tour with Lindsay and the way he spoke was beyond belief. I’m certainly glad I cancelled in the end. <br/>On a good note having spent most of our time out of the unit we had a fantastic time in the Barossa.
31364857,507736676,2019-08-12,39319163,Betty,"Stylish, got everything you need. Great place for 2. Lindsay was a great host and made sure we had everything when we settled in.  Got an outdoor BBQ and spa, too bad we didn't get a chance to enjoy either because the weather was just too cold."
31364857,537619200,2019-09-29,157862729,Cj,Studio 57 is extremely clean and quaint. It is very well dressed. The photographs don't do it justice. Very private from the hosts residence and the outdoor area is amazing. The studio had everything we needed. The bed is firmer than I am used to but still extremely comfortable. We were there for my partner's birthday and they even left us a birthday card! A highly recommended bnb! We will be back!
31364857,543025405,2019-10-07,159796505,Alex,Staying at this place was great. It is clean and tidy and well equipped and in a good location. We had a great time and would visit again.
31364857,553355694,2019-10-24,176886515,Geoff,"Murnanes place is a lovely little retreat, spotlessly clean and with some nice touches. We would definitely stay again"
31364857,556974468,2019-10-31,9043001,Karen,"Loved our stay at Studio 57.  The photos really don’t do this place justice.  It was much larger than we were expecting and we loved all of the little extras (robes, wine, chocolate, milk etc).  We would without a doubt stay here again, and have already recommended it to some friends."
31364857,559872389,2019-11-04,140887094,Rohan,Fantastic hosts! Would stay again anytime given the chance. Great space topped off with the host being our chauffeur for our winery tour. Would recommend to anyone looking for accommodation in the Barossa!
31364857,565834734,2019-11-17,58062135,Jennet,"As well as accommodation, Lindsey does personalised tours of the Barossa which we can recommend. You get to go where you want to go at your own pace!"
31364857,568031822,2019-11-23,61957352,Justin,"Great location - close proximity to wineries & town. Clean, comfortable and nice amenities."
31364857,570616998,2019-11-29,20836121,Andy,"What a great experience! This is such a nice place to stay in Barossa valley. The pictures really don't do justice to this very nice appartement. The location is quiet, the town center and some wineries (including Peter Lehmann if you are looking for big one) are in walking distance and the hosts are super nice. Nothing to worry about in this appartement! Super clean, super comfy and it has everything you need incl. a BBQ place, a whirlpool, nice terasse to have breakfast or BBQ outside and general items like a huge fridge, dishes, glases, etc. . We have also booked a wine tour with Lindsay (the host) and it was a blast. My wife and me highly recommend it if you stay here! It is a private tour and you can discuss upfront with Lindsay where to go. We left out the big wineries and went to some small wineries and a brewery, which we would never have found without Lindsay. It is definitely a special wine tour as Lindsay is well-known in the area and has a huge knowledge about it. It gave us a really special feeling as we never felt like normal ""tourists"" going from winery to winery, but more like locals meeting friends and drink some wine...well, we were still tourists :-) , but it was a great experience. Definitely the best stay during our holiday!"

31364857,589397239,2020-01-05,24642062,Nisha,"Studio 57 is a self-sufficient aesthetically-pleasing spot. Had everything we needed. Pictures don’t do justice. Great location, so central for us to get around. Even walking distance if you’d like that too. We were celebrating a birthday and were pleasantly surprised with a bottle of wine and a birthday card upon arrival. Very sweet of Lindsay and Annemaree to go that extra mile. We booked a wine tour with Lindsay as well, he knows the best spots. Pillows are plenty and bed is very comfy, but if you can only sleep on a firm pillow - bring your own. Don’t leave without saying hi to Denzel (the cutest Cavoodle in Tannunda). Forgot our passports behind and Annemaree was kind enough to send them back to us by post. Can’t recommend this place enough!"

31364857,632439933,2020-06-27,346971430,Wayne,"Great location for the Barossa.<br/>Spotlessly clean - could eat off the floor! If you are a clean freak this place won't disappoint.<br/>Lindsay met us on arrival and showed us around his lovely little place.<br/>Our only criticism was that the property is on the same grounds as the hosts - not sure this was mentioned on the site posting. Though the hosts didn't interfere or disturb us at all.<br/>The spa in the back overlooks what is possibly a ""shared"" garden. Lindsay assured us that the blinds on his house which possibly overlooked the rear yard were constantly pulled down during our stay (which they were) but we just didn't feel comfortable having a spa.<br/>That aside a great place to stay"
31364857,637007230,2020-07-11,24525855,Megan,"We absolutely loved our stay at Studio 57! The perfect spot for a romantic getaway. Lindsay was a wonderful host, responding quickly to all communication and meeting us on arrival to show us around. The space is beautifully styled and absolutely spotless. The bed super comfortable, the spa and fireplace a treat. We can't recommend this place highly enough."
31364857,638272269,2020-07-14,26939375,Nadine,"Studio 57 was absolutely perfect for our 2 person getaway. The apartment was sparkling clean, homey and had all the amenities you would need. The hosts also run wine tours which is super convenient, and we had the absolute pleasure of having a private tour with Lindsay organizing it for us. Although we went in middle of winter, when we were at the apartment at night we spent most of our time in the gorgeous outdoor area in the spa, with the heater on and a glass of wine. I would definitely recommend, perfect stay and very helpful and kind hosts. Thankyou!"
31364857,639213232,2020-07-18,329496805,Angela,"Small, but clean and new.  Limited indoor and outdoor space   - note this a studio in the owners backyard."

31364857,644421890,2020-07-31,269978654,Kate,Although this property is in the same yard as the owners you would not be able to tell from inside the studio apartment. It was sparkling clean and they have thought of everything!!! There was a screen in the outdoor patio area which made it feel very secluded and private. The hot tub is to die for. I would definitely stay here again!!
31364857,645480369,2020-08-02,353543176,Detlef,"Awesome Apartment clean, modern and comfortable close to town centre and recommend the wine tour with Lindsay in his luxurious Holden HSV Grange."

It also offers a large covered / non covered outdoor area with a jacuzzi and BBQ facilities. This is an ideal place to visit the barossa valley with walkimg distance from wineries, shops and restaurants. A must visit."
31364857,718565232,2020-12-27,88762017,Fernanda,"Extremely pleasant stay. A hidden gem in Barossa. Everything is well thought for you to feel in a 5-star location. The bed is comfortable, the decoration makes you feel at home. The outside jacuzzi is an extra that makes it even more delightful. A well-equipped bbq and a nice backyard may convince you to spend more time at home than visiting the vineyards. Every detail has a lot of care from the hosts. Not to mention the location. Right at the Tanunda’s centre,  which makes your life very convenient. <br/>Totally recommendable!!"

31364857,726947384,2021-01-26,32397696,Lucy,"The studio apartment is on the same block as the main house and although we did see Lindsay around, it is very private. It shares a driveway with the main house. The studio was very clean and tidy and they gifted us a bottle of wine for our stay which was a nice touch. The outdoor/spa area is shared with the main house although there is a privacy blind that can be pulled down. The house is also very close to the Main Street of Barossa and some wineries. Would recommend staying here!"

31364857,730435181,2021-02-11,115542497,Taya,"What a terrific little gem to explore the Barossa from. Studio 57 was decked out with all the amenities that you would need for a memorable stay. <br/>I loved the private garden space, setup with a TV and tub, which was perfect to while the hours away with a bottle of red wine. <br/>Don't forget to try the restaurant '1918' whilst you are in town, serving up the best food & wine in their gorgeous garden area. <br/>The hosts were great, check-in was easy and hassle free. However note the studio is close the to the owners adjoining property, in case anyone was seeking pure privacy. <br/>I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. It was a wonderful spot! 5 stars."

Sue met us on arrival with apple to feed them much to his delight! The bedrooms all have comfy beds with stylish and warm bedding. The living room is cozy with plenty of seating and a combustion stove which was lit for our arrival. A very welcoming sight on a cold August day!

32551818,494381136751226130,2021-11-12,79153250,Alan,"We had the pleasure of spending five nights at Barossa Bliss. The home was extremely clean, modern and contained all of our needs (eg towels, blankets, heating with a well stocked pantry).  We had our little fur pensioner (we call her that as she is13 years old definitely not a fur baby!!!) and she loved playing outside in a completely secure backyard. The home was approx one kilometre from the main street where eating and shopping choices were abundant and Tanunda was only a five minute drive. Would we recommend Ben's home...absolutely and would we stay there again...absolutely. Whiklst we love looking after our Grand kids we also enjoy our own time away which we thoroughly did at Ben's Barossa Bliss. Thank you Ben for allowing us to stay at your Home."
32789383,487324481,2019-07-14,36332329,Judith,"Beautiful home in middle of country side, great walks available. Downsides are you have to pay extra to stay only one night, and you have to pick up the keys from anothe location."

The property is beautiful for anybody whom loves nature and the outdoors, go for a wonder during the early morning to catch some kangaroos jumping around, watch beautiful birds taking baths as you sip your evening wine at the outdoor patio, and please don't miss the local boutique wineries (especially Ballycroft - beautiful full bodied wines) whilst you're there. Really need to stay for more than two nights if you are to enjoy the trip here. Have fun!"
32789383,557839305,2019-11-02,3706483,Kim,"Wings is the perfect place to getaway and unplug. We stayed at wings with our 20mnth old son and the place was perfectly equipped for us to enjoy the surroundings, enjoy family meals immersed in nature, explore the Barossa Valley throughout the day, and have a peaceful sleep at night. <br/>We were also delightfully greeted on arrival by the resident roo his bunny buddy."
32789383,571289323,2019-12-01,156019530,Chelsea,The stay was lovely. The house is beautiful and tidy! Nice touches for our wedding. Breakfast the morning after. A shame the communication wasnt great beforehand. No replies on Airbnb. No emails. (Even though we had confirmed our contact details) Had to call the owner to get more info. I'd definitely recommend installing a lock box or safe for easy access to the property. Key was an extra 15 minute drive to pick up and drop off. Other than this a nice place with lots wildlife and character! Thanks!

The house was perfectly suited to the environment. The little things we appreciated like the music provided, nice bathrooms and large spaces. Drinking wine and sitting under the vines was a bit of magic. Such a nice part of our holiday. We won’t forget staying at wings."
32789383,727788375,2021-01-30,169611420,Luke,The place was in a secluded area on a huge property with lots of wildlife. The key pickup was 13km out of the way each way and was a hassle. A keylocker would make this experience so much better.
32789383,737422282,2021-03-07,51859311,Elena,Graeme’s place is exceptional - very secluded with a lot of opportunities to see wildlife and enjoy silence and serenity of nature.

Great place to unwind and reset as it's in middle of bushland."

32789383,401668655980510423,2021-07-08,136088357,Janette,"Wings is undoubtedly a hidden natural treasure in the crown of the Barossa Valley that’s well worth discovering. Although only 8km from our front door, the glorious native bush with abundant wildlife and open glades with sweeping views across Eden Valley, are an utter privilege to behold. We adored our second stay at Wings and hope to return again and again to bask in its natural beauty, recharge and nourish our souls."

33539267,462234019,2019-06-02,46748359,Lisa,"Lovely old chapel, very comfortable and full of thoughtful touches - we enjoyed the complimentary wine and port, made ourselves a lovely breakfast with the supplies provided, and enjoyed a roaring wood fire and watching a film on the telly after a hard day's wine tasting, haha. It was a little bit cold so had to keep the aircon going full time when fire not in play! Thanks Jonathan for a warm welcome and great communication and, of course, an enjoyable wine tasting day out."

33539267,552111192,2019-10-21,11851005,Fiona,Perfect hosts.. the space looks amazing in photos.. is 1000 times better still in person. Brilliant base for exploring the barossa and having a cheeky wine in the evening.

33539267,580609561,2019-12-22,48867344,Team,Beautiful property for easy access to Barossa wineries. Stylish and spacious with thoughtful touches. The Wi-fi was down when we visited but Jonathan was very apologetic about it and said it was being resolved.
33539267,586519476,2020-01-01,12476436,Alan,"The Chapel is a really cute and unique property, well stocked and very comfortable, in an excellent location for exploring the Barossa. We enjoyed our NYE holiday with friends in the house. <br/><br/>There were a few minor maintenance issues (which were noted by the owners on arrival) and it would have been great to have some curtains upstairs as the sun comes in very early this time of year, but otherwise we enjoyed the house. Definitely note that both bedrooms are open with very little privacy which may be an issue for anyone concerned about that."
33539267,595350617,2020-01-20,50031394,Rachel,"Great spot for a very relaxing few days. We took up Jonathan’s offer of a private tour of the Barossa and Eden valleys, and we had a wonderfully pampered and informative day. Perfect long week getaway."
33539267,606060842,2020-02-15,290020129,Olga,Great place and great experience! Perfect pick for a romantic getaway!

33539267,628419064,2020-06-08,128209074,Milly,"Photos do not do this place justice! We booked in for a relaxing weekend away, and were absolutely blown away when we arrived. The bath tub is worth mentioning - its more like a swimming pool and was the highlight of our stay. The styling and renovations to the old chapel are stunning and complimentary to its heritage. Hosts provided great advice on wineries to visit. I've had many friends contact us and ask where we stayed and have happily referred them on!"
33539267,629392211,2020-06-14,225672443,Kia,Jonathon and Kate have created a wonderfully romantic space and a a treasure for the Barossa.

33539267,632157594,2020-06-26,22652840,Karen,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful cottage. Stayed here 20 years ago for our wedding night and the new renovations have only added to the place, whilst still keeping the character. Everything you need is supplied and lots of little touches to make it a warm comfortable place to relax and unwind. The addition of the spa bath was perfect and with added touches of candles made it very romantic. A glass of Shiraz in front of the fire certainly didn’t hurt, either! Fantastic place to base yourselves from which to explore the region and would definitely recommend."
33539267,632679252,2020-06-27,347962135,Jessica,"Beautiful location in a fantastic little town, close to supermarket and cafe/bakery. Stunning views and walking distance to wineries.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the pictures don't quite do it justice; when we arrived we were just blown away by this amazing space. Very cosy and comfortable, and has everything you could need. The spa bath is AMAZING, so relaxing. <br/>It's in a perfect spot to explore the barossa, close to so many amazing wineries. Jonathan and Kate are great hosts, everything was easy. We will definately be back!"
33539267,636301260,2020-07-09,35928106,Michael,"Thanks for offering up this amazing space in Lyndoch, a short drive from all that the Barossa has to offer. The Chapel is a beautiful and tasteful conversion. Very warm in the middle of winter, good amenities and the outstanding bath must be mentioned. Thanks for your hospitality and will definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay somewhere stylish and sweet.<br/>Mike"
33539267,637025417,2020-07-12,60333746,Isobel,"Beautiful, one of a kind home. We loved all the small touches and the fire kept us warm! Love the Barossa but felt conflicted leaving the house as The Chapel is enough of a reason to visit on it’s own! Thank you"
33539267,637972535,2020-07-14,352622898,Gareth,"Such a beautifully renovated chapel in a stunning region. Warm, lovingly decorated space for all to enjoy. LOVED the spa bath!"

33539267,668248368,2020-09-27,356698838,Emma,"Throughout our stay, Jonathan and Kate were easily contactable and communication was easy and genuine. Good parking just off the street, and the check in process was also very quick and easy. <br/><br/>Loved the amenities, especially the spacious bath! Hot water and heating throughout the place was spot on! Will be recommending this place to family and friends for sure!"
33539267,669469108,2020-09-30,77607793,Paul,"If you’re looking for somewhere to stay in the Barossa, then this is the perfect place!! We had an amazing stay at the chapel. It is well located and close to several excellent wineries and food options. The chapel itself has so much character and a nice touch of luxury. You could easily sleep 4 adults in the chapel quite comfortably with the two separate sleeping areas. We couldn’t  recommend staying here more!"
33539267,670018656,2020-10-01,143276610,Karlee,The Chapel is absolutely amazing. Me and my partner had the best time. The hosts are beyond helpful and the space is beautiful. Could not recommend this stay enough. The wine tour with Johnethan is a must do and exceeded our every expectation. We cannot wait to come back
33539267,671410758,2020-10-05,46598603,Katarzyna,"Beautiful space, quaint, had a lovely stay here"
33539267,672007402,2020-10-06,127453358,Susan,"The chapel was a stunning place, with old world charm and an amazing bath tub. We loved our stay!"
33539267,701958643,2020-10-19,48818926,Hanna,We arrived after dark and found a beautifully lit cottage that was a delight from the outside. The interior was no less disappointing. It was warm and welcoming. The interior tastefully decorated. The owners have gone to extra time and effort to supply all the comforts of home. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it. Hopefully we will be able to come back one day.
33539267,702435039,2020-10-21,66680841,Rachael,"The Chapel provided the most relaxing and indulgent holiday ever. We enjoyed the quiet location, picturesque views, beautiful building, and the overall unique experience. Jonathan was very welcoming and clearly knew the area well. A brilliant place for a romantic getaway or a girls trip!"
33539267,704061733,2020-10-25,66714444,Karen,Perfect location to all the local towns. Never had a problem getting a taxi anywhere if we wanted to both have a wine. <br/><br/>Accomodation so peaceful & relaxing. Everything you need. Their hair dryer saved my life. All the things you need for extended stay. Will definitely book again if we need accomodation in the area.
33539267,705238014,2020-10-31,119562538,Brodie,⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
33539267,706810652,2020-11-05,31501396,Alison,This is a cute and well appointed cottage. I'd give it a 5 star rating except that the gap between the walls and roof in the stunning main bathroom allowed dirt and insects in. Otherwise beautiful.
33539267,713175729,2020-12-03,16399411,Johan,"Jonathan and Kate were lovely hosts. The spa bath in the middle of the open space was the best! There were many small touches such as the robes, towels and milk, tea/coffee and breakfast items. Although it was just the two of us for a romantic weekend, there’s enough space for two couples with the upstairs section. The location is good with a few hotels and cafes around the corner, and the Barossa wineries starting just there. Would love to stay again!"
33539267,715460451,2020-12-14,345431238,Kayla,"My wife and I were blown away by the beauty of the chapel. It was truly stunning to stay in such a beautiful and well redesigned heritage building. The finishes such as the staircase and bathroom really added to the positive experience. A point of growth for the hosts would be to work on cleanliness between guests such as vacuuming thoroughly, checking all the dishes are cleaned properly and cleaning dirt off the bath robes. Outside of cleanliness, we would recommend this stellar stay"
33539267,716355964,2020-12-18,308429878,Christos,Was a nice enjoyable stay
33539267,717284697,2020-12-21,40153547,Madden,"The Chapel is such a unique, beautiful and central option for Barossa accommodation. It was spacious and an extremely beautiful building. Coming to the Barossa for the first time, Jonathan and Kate had lots of great local suggestions available and the Chapel had generous amenities. Highly, highly recommend!!"
33539267,721804432,2021-01-03,140285536,Laura,It's a cool place. Jonathan and Kate were very kind to let us check out late as it was the morning after our wedding. The kitchen door did not lock though which was not good.
33539267,722467347,2021-01-07,8404428,Bård,Very unique stay in beautiful old Chapel. Lovely bathroom with big bath. Jonathan took us on a wine tour which was also a great experience. Highly recommend.
33539267,723150890,2021-01-09,362093873,Laura,Booked this airbnb for my parents as a birthday gift to my mother. They both absolutely loved the place and came back with raving reviews! They showed me around through facetime and it looked absolutely gorgeous
33539267,726088774,2021-01-23,74946908,Branden,Outstanding accommodation. Walking distance to the local township and a great base to the entrance of the Barossa. The bathroom area is glorious and a great place to relax after cycling the gorgeous Barossa Bike Trail. The community spirit in Lyndoch is infectious.. would highly recommend staying at the Chapel... we’ll be back.
33539267,727232754,2021-01-28,126981258,Alison,We couldn’t have been happier with our stay at The Chapel. The accommodation was even more stylish than the photos suggested and the hosts saw to every little detail (including a welcoming decanter of port on the coffee table). I would thoroughly recommend the beautiful Chapel to any friends or family travelling to Barossa! Thanks again Jonathan and Kate.
33539267,728938732,2021-02-05,220851238,Patrick,The Chapel was amazing! Great distance from most wineries and a very homely and comforting place! Would definitely recommend!
33539267,729790697,2021-02-08,94216946,Cohen,"My girlfriend and I both booked a stay at The Chapel and were blown away. The photos do not do this place justice.  <br/><br/>If you’re looking for an affordable stay that is close to all the wineries in the region, is visually stunning and has fantastic hosts this is the place to book. <br/><br/>John gave both of us plenty of tips for the area for places to both eat and see. John also has his own wine tour business and this was certainly the highlight of our trip. The tour picked us up from the chapel and was tailored to places we were interested in. I was not a big wine drinker but I sure am now. <br/><br/>If you want to experience the full taste of the Barossa this air Bnb and wine tour is a must."
33539267,730428291,2021-02-11,105817865,Arthur,"If you’re traveling to the Barossa this is the place to stay. So get in early, don’t miss out."

33539267,740177957,2021-03-19,13614763,Gabrielle,Such an amazing home ! I couldn't stop walking into the bathroom it was just magical as the bath was fantastic. Having breakfast outside under the grape vines with grapes on them was a moment to remember.
33539267,740790966,2021-03-21,7315585,Lachlan,We stayed at The Chapel for a weekend in the Barossa. It was such a fantastic space and we had a great time.  It's well located so you can get to the wineries easily and it has a nice vibe for when we felt like staying in.  The check in process was super easy as well.
33539267,741655577,2021-03-22,56441813,Milena,such a beautiful home. this place had all the five star features you would want. such a stunning area. loved every minute
33539267,744808490,2021-04-03,120148999,Andrea,We had a lovely time in the Barossa Valley. <br/>The chapel was centrally located to all the areas we wanted to visit. <br/>The accommodation is attractive and comfortable - a lovely retreat to retire to after a big day of wine tasting and touring. <br/>I have already recommended  friends and family to consider staying here. <br/>We would certainly want to book the Chapel if we were lucky enough to return to the Barossa.<br/>A🌸
33539267,746504036,2021-04-06,4958232,Jennifer,Great place! Especially the details and the bath! Highly recommend!
33539267,748591760,2021-04-14,26925080,Eugene,"This converted chapel is clean and has a great bathroom. There is bedding and a bathroom downstairs as well as a mezzanine bedroom and bathroom. We didn’t use the upstairs bedroom and bathroom as getting a suitcase up the spiral stairs would be a bit of a job, but the bedding downstairs was comfortable and clean.  The huge spa bath downstairs was very nice touch."
33539267,749318660,2021-04-17,239683136,Kerry,"Definitely recommend staying @ the Chapel. It has so much character and is really well appointed.<br/><br/>The highlight is definitely the spa bath and robes - very luxurious!<br/><br/>The Chapel’s decor was a stunning mix of original and modern- checkered tiles, stain glass windows! <br/><br/>Everything you need is there! Must stay in the Barossa"
33539267,753510487,2021-05-01,162065864,Natalie,"The Chapel was a charming place to stay for our recent Barossa Valley getaway.<br/>Quaint, with lots of charm, and some lovely, thoughtful touches like a loaf of bread and milk in the fridge for a cup of tea or coffee on arrival, it was great not to have to run off and grab those things after a long day's travel to our destination.<br/>There was a lovely port in the lounge room for our first night there which too, was very much appreciated.<br/>The location is good with the pub and grocery store, a short, easy walk away.  <br/>If you are looking for dinner, walk down to the Lord Lyndoch restaurant which served up the most superb meal we have eaten for a very long time.   <br/>The Chapel is located well for your winery tours and sightseeing in the Barossa Valley."
33539267,754534319,2021-05-03,222341013,Mario,Wonderful ambience in this perfectly renovated chapel. Great location to access all of the Barossa.
33539267,761877200,2021-05-23,365026272,Amy,Photos do not do this property justice! So homely and comfortable.  The bathroom  is amazing and so relaxing! <br/>This property is great for a girls weekend or even a romantic getaway. <br/>Jonathan and Kate touched base the whole time to make sure we were comfortable and to see if there was anything we needed. <br/>Can not recommend highly enough!
33539267,762934062,2021-05-27,29006852,Laura,"The Chapel was a wonderful and unique stay in wine country! A great location to get around the Barossa (we also easily drove to Adelaide and Clare from here).<br/>It was a clean, comfortable and atmospheric stay, with great communication and service from the hosts!"
33539267,765238005,2021-06-01,248593543,Debbie,"We had a wonderful time at The Chapel. It is a great place for couples. There is a lot to love about the place - the stone walls in the massive spa room with nooks for placing candles, the stone feature wall in the living room, the interesting windows, the well equipped kitchen with oven. The place is very comfortable and romantic. We also recommend eating at the Table cafe and wine bar in Lyndoch (not all places are open on a Monday or Tuesday). Jonathan and Kate were excellent hosts, responding quickly if we had a question. Thanks again for an enjoyable stay."
33539267,766038895,2021-06-04,67819818,Isobelle,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Chapel. Lyndoch is a perfect gateway for the Barossa and kate and Jonathan’s communication was excellent
33539267,766820038,2021-06-06,149897690,Angie,"Even more charming in real life, this beautiful church conversion was a real highlight during our Barossa visit. With thoughtful touches throughout and great communication from Jonathan and Kate, I highly recommend staying here and will definitely be telling friends and family about it. We loved our time here, thank you Jonathan and Kate."
33539267,768474974,2021-06-10,160950779,Karen,Lovely restored chapel surrounded  by pretty gardens in Lyndoch. Surrounded by superb wineries and restaurants of the Barossa Valley  perfect for a getaway.
33539267,770676446,2021-06-15,17383211,Andrew,The Chapel is just a fantastic historic building to stay in for a trip to the Barossa. The fireplace and the massive spa in the bathroom adds to the charm
33539267,391600806254959416,2021-06-24,184342377,Capucine,What a beautiful piece of history to stay in. Well renovated with great personal touches to make our stay comfortable. I highly recommend the Chapel as a play to stay to enjoy the Barossa.
33539267,401022719459618831,2021-07-07,343960682,Sabine,"A super comfortable and beautiful stay. Loved being on the corner of the street to see amazing sunrises. The fire place worked so well to heat up the church as it is a decent open space. The spa bath and bathroom were a standout feature! Jonathan and Kate communicated extremely well and were always there to answer any questions we had. It was a very beautiful stay, thank you!!"
33539267,403865216496104165,2021-07-11,216127308,David,Great place. Cosy and great location for visiting wineries. Thoroughly recommended!

This is sort of in the same room as the other bed which is on a mezzanine. So not the most private with no walls between them etc. <br/><br/>That being said it was a beautiful place and we really enjoyed our trip."

The way this Chapel has been renovated creates an elegant, comfortable and welcoming environment. Not to mention the facilities that are offered. If you thought that bath in the main bathroom looked big in the picture, just wait till you see it in person. Jonathan and Kate even left soft robes and towels out, I felt like I was equally in a luxury escape as well as a fairytale. <br/><br/>Now for Jonathan and Kate, from the moment we had booked this accomodation they were completely welcoming and their communication was excellent. They provided us we some provisions like a fresh loaf of bread, butter,  jams, milk and coffee/tea. <br/>They helped us organise a tour around the Barossa with their business Barossa Sensations to different wineries, even a quick stop in to a beer brewery for my fiancés preference. <br/><br/>We had more than an amazing time, and such a perfect way to wind down after such a busy and stressful year!<br/><br/>Thankyou so much!"

We were very comfortable and the apartment was spotless. It was in a central position to drive to a variety of wineries. <br/>We would highly recommend this accommodation.

33885699,567191476,2019-11-21,154434762,Ben,A lovely place in the middle of town with a short driving distance to wineries in the area.

It appears to be a fresh, recently renovated unit with new appliances and furnishings. Every room, including the all-important bedrooms and bathroom, was sparkling clean throughout. Bedding and towels were hotel-quality clean. A lot of the bathroom and kitchen products stood out as eco-friendly. AppleTV was appreciated for the extra entertainment options. Location is perfect, being one street back from Murray St which is the heart of Tanunda with great food and drink options a short walk away. Could not fault the unit at all. Tracy the host has done an amazingly thorough job to make a very comfortable, homely experience. I highly recommend this place and we'd definitely stay here again!"

The location was perfect; it was clean, tidy and stylish; and the little extra touches were so thoughtful and appreciated! From the milk, bread, cereal, eggs and coffee machine that were provided, to the little shampoo and conditioners in the shower, to the house being wonderfully cool on arrival on a hot 40+ degree day, we couldn't fault our stay! We would recommend highly, and would love to come back and stay. The only negative was that we only had 2 nights here! Would've loved to have longer. Thanks so much Tracy!!"
33885699,585582144,2019-12-31,107220077,Ros,"A big thank you to Tracey for providing such a clean and well appointed apartment for our stay in the Barossa. It was great to walk into the apartment to find the air conditioning on as it was a day of 43 degrees, much appreciated. We will definitely recommend Boseka to our friends. Have a fabulous 2020."
33885699,592429986,2020-01-12,165033137,Jennifer,"What is advertised is what you get .<br/>A fresh clean and inviting place. As soon as you enter the apartment your eyes are drawn to open space with lots of natural light and a homely feel .<br/>Tracy’s special touches of lovely decor and organic teas etc are only just a few of the treats you will be very delighted to see . <br/>Included is high quality linen with great comfort upstairs in the bedrooms and even though the bathroom is very small everything is exceptionally clean and modern . <br/>With only a short walk to the Main Street ,this little gem “Boseka” in Tanunda in the Barossa is in a great spot."

33885699,603981452,2020-02-10,14209714,Liam,The place was lovely and clean and rather spacious. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the high quality linen made it a hotel style experience. The extra inclusions of high quality local produce and stylish kitchen made it easy to stay in at times to cook and eat. The extra considerations toward organic and green products through out the place added to the well thought out hospitality this host provided. Easy walking distance to local places but the off street parking is reassuring towards the want to hire a car to really experience the wonderful places to visit in nearby areas. Perfect place to stay for a food and wine lover.

In light of the COVID19 stress, Tracy went out of her way to not only keep the place clean and safe for us but also ensured we had food available and a clear list of where we could buy food to take home. Since we love the outdoors she also provided us with detailed descriptions of her favourite walks so we were well set up. On arrival the house was sparklingly clean and tastefully decorated. It was just as nice not going out in the evening when the place is so nice. We will be back!"

33885699,403902455079335177,2021-07-11,23677364,Kate,Excellent location and very cosy home. Tracy was extremely helpful in the lead up.

33885699,407548128541222829,2021-07-16,39660929,Ashley,"Tracy’s loft is exactly as the photos show! We loved the place, kept warm with the heating, comfy beds with towels and toiletries provided. Easy check-in and the biggest win of the place is the location - literally walking distance from the main strip of Tanunda shops. Even with wet weather, it was no problem with minimal walk time (5 mins) to the shops!<br/><br/>Eggs, bread, spreads and milk were such a nice touch - and the kitchen was stocked perfectly. <br/><br/>Really loved the aesthetic of the place and was overall a wonderful stay! Beautifully furnished, stocked and clean!<br/><br/>The only (tiny) caution I’d have is for any light sleepers, as the stairs are creaky - and can be heard throughout the place when walking in either bedroom. But please don’t let that detract from an otherwise perfect, 10 out of 10 place! <br/><br/>We used this place as our home base for trips out to the Barossa, being only 10-15 minutes from major, must-visit wineries and eateries. Highly, highly recommended."
33885699,417583992408188668,2021-07-29,51631079,Katie,Great location - within walking distance of Tanunda's Main Street and fully equipped with all you need. Was nice and warm during chilly winter. Quiet and a lovely base from which to work or explore the region.

Walking distance to pubs, cafes, supermarkets, etc. Well équipes kitchen with everything we needed for a short stay. The beds are really comfortable too! The shower does take some getting used to.

The loft was so beautiful and provided an immediate sense of relief once walking in. The loft was so perfect in every single aspect.

Thank you SO much Tracy"

33968239,580626549,2019-12-23,274387103,Elise,"Everything you could ask for in a getaway, a stylish and beautiful home, extremely helpful and welcoming hosts, and the Barossa at your finger tips. Highly recommend you pick The Clyde for your next Barossa visit!!"
33968239,584995341,2019-12-30,135113250,Michelle,"Words cannot express what an incredible stay our family just had at The Clyde for a week over Christmas! The house was absolutely beautiful, including a lovely pool that we enjoyed with our kids every day, and we also fell in love with town of Greenock. Janine thought of every little touch to make our stay special, including holiday decorations, incredible amenities, and delicious treats to enjoy during our stay. We explored local wineries, restaurants and breweries by foot and spent a few days exploring the Barossa Valley, Adelaide Hills and Adelaide by car. Our stay at The Clyde was the highlight of our trip and we will be back!!"
33968239,604625119,2020-02-12,17903140,Michael,A stylish and comfortable house ideally situated for exploring the Barossa and Clare Valleys. The hosts have taken a great deal of trouble in providing quality furnishings and equipment and have also been unusually generous in stocking it with provisions. The air-conditioning coped well with widely varying temperatures during our month long stay whilst the large TV screen with Netflix was a pleasant bonus. The only slight negative might be that light sleepers could find intrusive the noise from the surprisingly busy road in front of the house particularly in the master bedroom. However we would certainly hope to return to this house when making future trips to the region.
33968239,715971560,2020-12-17,25770228,Alistair,"The Clyde made our stay in Barossa Valley absolutely perfect. The attention to detail was amazing, and we loved the wine and cheese platter provisions on arrival. Breakfast supplies also meant we could relax as soon as we arrived. This place was unlike any other we've stayed in, Janine and Matt go above and beyond to ensure that guests are well looked after. Highly recommend The Clyde!"

We will absolutely be back to stay again!"
33968239,729322514,2021-02-06,384649271,Stefanie,"We were all so happy with our stay at the Clyde.

33968239,745846310,2021-04-05,169020022,Ashleigh,"In all the places I’ve travelled and all the cities I’ve seen, The Clyde was by far one of the most beautiful accommodations I’ve had the pleasure of staying in. <br/>The ammenities were more than enough to see to our every need and Janine and Matt had ensured we had everything, down to the stunning South Australian produce to drink and nibble on. <br/>Not to mention the home is gorgeous.<br/>I can’t wait to be back!"
34291502,485440942,2019-07-11,6795454,Guangfu,We absolutely love our stay at Achala’s place. Our experience of the SA farm is amazing. Definitely will return to this place in the future.
34291502,525463972,2019-09-08,268135422,Jodie,Achala and her family made us feel very welcome in their home. We were free to treat their home as our own. I found the kitchen easy to cook in. My kids loved the big smart TV and absolutely adored Achala’s gorgeous little girl. I think the highlight of their stay there was playing with her.
34661591,458246224,2019-05-25,261883132,Jaidan,"Josie and Andrews place was a very comfortable stay. Everything we needed was provided, and it was super cozy and warm. They supplied cheese and crackers and food for breakfast, which was such a nice little touch. I would highly recommend staying at their place!"
34661591,464561129,2019-06-06,94090123,Belinda,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here whilst visiting the Barossa! Josie and Andrew were wonderful hosts and went out of their way to help with food/winery suggestions and anything we needed. The cottage is newly revamped, super clean and has everything you will need, oh and some little extras to make it feel more like home. Beautiful outlook to vineyard at both front and back and even a cellar door to visit on the neighbouring property. Would highly recommend!"
34661591,465525628,2019-06-08,28285079,Dee,"We loved the location just out of town but near everything at the same time. Very comfortable Airbnb, we chose to stay in at night after winery lunches out. <br/>Beautiful Barossa sunsets from the front porch with a few wines, and lovely starry nights, hard to beat. Nice breakfasts, comfortable bed and all you need for a relaxing leisurely stay. <br/>Thanks Josie and Andrew."
34661591,474119619,2019-06-22,32021593,Claudia,"Josie and Andrew’s place was beautiful and set amongst the vines as described. Perfect for a weekend away, and in close proximity to everywhere you’d want to visit whilst in the Barossa. Would definitely recommend."
34661591,479446515,2019-07-01,17231312,Tom,This is an amazing guest house. It is private and has a wonderfully stocked fridge. Josie and Andrew have done a great job renovating the property and everything is sparkling clean. The location (within the vines) is perfect for a weekend or mid week getaway to explore the Barossa Valley. We highly recommend this property.
34661591,482715456,2019-07-07,114145061,Sam,"Josie & Andrew’s place is simply perfect. My girlfriend and I stayed here for a couple nights and we absolutely loved it. The cottage itself was extremely clean and felt brand new, kitchen and bathroom were full of all the amenities you could possibly need, bedroom was really comfortable and even had an electric blanket. The biggest stand out for us was the location, the cottage is located right in the middle of a vineyard so you literally look out the window onto the vines themselves. The hosts recommended we check out Tomfoolery winery which is the vineyard next door, and we were very glad we did because the wine tasting was amazing and it is only a minute walk from your front door! Everything else is within a short drive so we were never in the car for too long. Josie and Andrew could not have been more welcoming hosts. They were accommodating with our check in/out time and were very knowledgeable of all things Barossa and gave us some great tips. Truly lovely people and I hope we will cross paths in the future. Highly recommend staying here!<br/><br/>Sam & Emily"
34661591,487237446,2019-07-14,192434044,Sammy,Great people and a beautiful place to stay. Amazing view over the vine yards and very central to all the attractions of the Barossa. Highly recommend

Great local knowledge of events and places to visit, would highly recommend!"
34661591,517900896,2019-08-26,41127492,Andrew,"We'd happily encourage anyone to stay here if you're in the area. Josie & Andrew are great friendly hosts and the property is outstanding. The amount of little extra touches (and some amazing local produce) included make this feel more home than home stay. Great location close to the best the Barossa has to offer. A little out of town, so it's beautifully quiet among the vines, but only a couple of minutes to Nuriootpa."
34661591,521413801,2019-09-01,99463736,Nicolas,Wonderful romantic getaway cottage for anyone looking to relax or indulge in the heart of the Barossa. Close to everything you need and the most welcoming and helpful hosts. Would recommend to anyone

As a nurse, I loved the addition of a first aid kit in the bathroom.<br/><br/>Be sure to ask them about winery options as they are great for local tips, and the winery next door gives you 10 per cent off purchases of you mention them. Fantastic!"

Josie went above and beyond to make sure we had a refrigerator stocked with vegan goodies, and the cottage was spotless (probably the cleaner Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in).

Josie & Andrew are fantastic hosts, from the time of booking, quick responses and helpful tips to their outstanding cottage.<br/><br/>The guest cottage is located between vineyards, in a quiet and peaceful location in the heart of Barrosa Valley.

Lovely to look out over the vines and see the wildlife. <br/>Amenities were great and we were overwhelmed how well stocked the fridge was when we arrived. Local tourist tips were spot on.<br/>We hope to return again"
34661591,590551434,2020-01-08,65572801,Michelle,"I cannot recommend Josie and Andrews place enough, one of my new favourite places in the world.

Outstanding hospitality from very thoughtful hosts, extremely comfortable and well-appointed accommodation where everything has been thought of, sparkling clean, and as for the location - you can walk to a winery *next door* to get a bottle or two. Spectacular sunsets, waking with birdsong every morning, a hammock for two....Josie and Andrew have thought of everything, and it shows. If we ever return to the Barossa, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thank you again for a wonderful relaxing time and for all the generous extras and helpful tips throughout our stay."

Jocelyn and Andrew have worked hard to ensure that the cottage provides an exceptional guest accommodation. The fit out and furnishings are of the highest quality and all done with thought and taste. The shower room is just amazing, perfect to wake you up or soothe you after a day in the hot Barossa sun. The hosts provide helpful local insights and tips to enable you to get the best out of your visit. Andrew has good taste in wineries, eateries and coffee shops! Watching the sunset in the evening form the verandah or double hammock is a highlight. I recommenda visit to the Tom Foolery tasting room just a few mins walk away. Enjoy!"

34914043,471660255,2019-06-18,105650440,Damian,"What an incredible place to stay! A working farm still home to the 7th Generation of the family. <br/><br/>The JHA stone cellar was an ultimate escape for us with all the luxuries and mod cons you could think of, full off hidden surprises to make us feel welcome.<br/><br/>A truly stunning renovation and extension that must be experienced to understand. <br/>Don’t change a thing at this property, it is perfect! From the old stone wall cellar room to the modern extension, underfloor heating and hot outdoor showers!<br/><br/>We are already planning our trip back at the end of the year!!!"
34914043,700504283,2020-10-15,49892351,Robin,"Staying at the JHÃ Stone Cellar is a truly special experience. What an amazing building formed from the restoration of an old stone barn melded with a modern addition to create something architecturally unique and spectacular. It sits on a rise and offers 270degree views over the peaceful rolling landscape. The house is so well appointed with thoughtful and luxurious fittings and stylishly decorated. The cooking facilities are a cooks delight and the opportunity to cook with an AGA oven and cooktop was something quite special. Our host, Jan, greeted us and gave us a quick but comprehensive orientation to the house and the region. Her recommendations were spot on. Don’t leave without taking the opportunity to have a tasting of The Hutton Vale Farm wines with John. There is a 10 minute drive into Angaston where you can get some Hutton Vale Farm lamb from the local butcher to cook at the house in the AGA or on the Weber Q. While you may just choose to stay in and enjoy the property and facilities, relaxing listening to vinyls on the record player, sipping local wines or g and t’s and taking in the views, it’s also an easy drive to see many of the highlights of the Barossa. I personally can’t wait to return for another stay at this property. Thank you Jan, John and Caitlin for providing such a beautiful space."

34914043,743912984,2021-03-30,85267799,Jillian,"What a way to experience the Barossa Valley!  Only a quick drive from Angaston and positioned in a beautiful pastoral setting, you could not ask for more, but you are given more!  Outstanding well appointed with stunning views. Everything you could want was there....even a clothes steamer!  We were expecting something really good but this was far beyond our expectations.  Fabulous comfortable beds, both king size with ensuites.  A place for everyone to sit in a comfy chair or sofa in the the lounge area...there was four of us.  A fridge stocked with goodies for breakfast and beyond.  Sheep and hens in the distance to entertain you.  A lovely bird bath where the magpies and willy wagtails came  to take their daily drink.  Beautiful moon rises and sun sets.  Places to sit in comfy chairs on the deck.  We loved the place so much we had dinner at 'home' three out of the four nights we stayed.   This is our third visit to the Barossa, and this is by far the best accommodation we have had.  Thank you Jan, Stuart, Cait and anyone else who is involved in giving us an outstanding memorable experience."

34914043,402435574880772763,2021-07-09,120418937,Sandra,"Such beautiful accommodation in an amazing setting. First class Barossa hospitality with every comfort thought of. The place is a stone and glass architectural masterpiece. Winter is a cosy time to visit with double glazing, underfloor heating and wood burning slow combustion. A perfect place to enjoy Barossa reds gazing at a beautiful pastoral scene through picture windows in front of a roaring fire while roasting a leg of lamb in the Aga. It even has a cellar room to retire to sample even more red. A tasting of Hutton Vale wines with Caitlin was a highlight. The cellar was like stepping into a hobbit’s cave. So homely and full of history and interesting stuff. Caitlin, a proud seventh generation Angas, is absolutely delightful and the Hutton Vale Shiraz is outstanding.  Such a quality Barossa experience. Thank you 😍"

I have rated 5 starts for cleanliness as the house was spotless.  Only negative was that the BBQ was dirty so didn't get used.  Jasmine was extremely apologetic when I messaged her and has said she will keep a closer eye on the cleaning.   Main living area is large open plan.  Bedrooms are generous sizes.  Was a perfect place for our big family gathering.  Would stay there again as a large group.

Gorgeous Barossa views and adorable farm animals to feed. <br/><br/>If I had one small gripe, it would be the mattresses. They’re like concrete.

35660705,473541239,2019-06-21,75599769,Jo,"From the start, our stay couldn't have been more relaxing and enjoyable. The property was beautifully landscaped and on arrival, we were met by Chris who showed us around the farm and introduced the alpacas! The grounds were stunning, from the nearby rolling fields where we spotted a few late night kangaroos from the kitchen window to the paddocks further down the track, there was lots of space to explore should we wish too and an abundance of wildlife. The stars at night were some of the brightest I have seen and the Airbnb had its own, private entrance and truly felt like our very own tranquil escape. <br/><br/>The log fire and cosy living room were dreamy, immaculately clean and with a homely feel. The bed was comfy, lovely linen sheets and despite the winter, the house never felt cold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an escape that is still a stone's throw from the Barossa. Plenty of nearby places to eat (a short drive) and caring, respectful hosts, who have put a great effort into the finishing touches. A gem in SA!"
35660705,474120117,2019-06-22,268912292,Ceri,"This has to be the best air bnb I think I have ever stayed in! The setting was absolutely perfect, peaceful, homely and the hosts were amazing! They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect but also left us to just enjoy the surroundings! A complementary bottle of wine whilst putting your feet up infront of the fire was the exact break anyone needs! Getting to meet and feed the alpacas was such a great experience and the hosts are so informative! <br/>We absolutely loved our stay and will be back!"
35660705,478340290,2019-06-29,70460686,Diana,"OMG Tracey and Chris have been amazing and we highly recommend it for anyone looking for a country stay. <br/><br/>Property - Gorgeous & picturesque <br/>Animals - Hilarious <br/>Hosts - Tracy was away during our visit but Chris was great, funny and super accomodating to us city folk. <br/>Personalised Touches - OMG who has pillow-top beds in Air BnB's ?

The flowers, the candles .. we just all loved the welcoming style of this house.<br/>Atmosphere - Homey, ohhh that fire was amazing <br/><br/>We just loved our little girls vaycay for the night, thank you for having such an amazing property and give our love to the cheeky alpaca's. <br/><br/>Diana xo"
35660705,484504044,2019-07-09,14338318,Michael,"Wonderful stay! the space is gorgeous and has everything you could need for several or one night stay, the fire was going when we arrived so the living room was toasty, the living room windows look out over the alpaca area which is entertaining. We mostly engaged with Chris who was passionate about the farm and was very welcoming, giving us the freedom to walk around the farm, enjoying the scenery, as well as take part in feeding and interacting with the alpacas as much as we liked. highly recommend!"

The property has many lovely design touches and is being thoughtfully restored/renovated. It is a lovely spot to both relax and truly unwind, or there are many nearby towns and attractions. Likewise there is plenty to amuse the family on the property, you can go for a walk and see kangaroos and many other animals, or interact  with and feed the alpacas. We learnt a lot about the breeding and behaviour of alpacas and our son loved hanging out with them."
35660705,491243985,2019-07-20,139216963,Lucy,"This place was above and beyond expectations cottage was lovely, fire place was fantastic and the extra touch of bacon and eggs for breakfast was great.

35660705,491947156,2019-07-21,126073313,Jeremy,"Tracey’s place is a beautiful, serene piece of farmland out in the Adelaide hills. On top of an amazing herd of alpacas, expect an enthusiastic welcome and roaring fire when you arrive along with a bottle of local wine, paddocks, woodlots and dams to explore if you feel like it, and a comfortable, modern set out of the house. <br/><br/>In the morning, wake up to the sunrise over the hills from a spectacular view out the bedroom window, and complimentary breakfast supplies. <br/><br/>We were lucky to join in the morning feeding of the alpacas too, which was a pretty special experience.<br/><br/>Would recommend!"

It is also convenient, only five minutes to the town for grocery shopping. <br/>Tracy and Chris the host couple are very considerate and nice.  They lit the fireplace for us in advance before our arrival and prepared so many wood for us. They also invited us to feed their alpacas which are so cute and furry. <br/>We also saw several kangaroos in the barn.  <br/>Very pleasant experience.  Highly recommended!<br/>距离巴罗萨主产区40公里，你可以在结束品酒之旅后带上心仪的酒驱车下塌这个宁静农庄，有2个大房间一个有着舒适长沙发的客厅，装备齐整的厨房，整体装饰干净精美，驱车6公里可到附近镇上的Food land超市买好牛排羊排，回来简单又原味配上红酒，宁静致远。主人夫妇热情好客，很早便为我们生好了壁炉，还准备了很多木头。他们还邀请我们去喂他们养的可爱羊驼，又看见了成群的袋鼠。<br/>如果时间允许，真想多住两天，呷口红酒惬意无比。"

The beds were extremely comfortable and gave for a great night sleep.  <br/>The location is wonderful.  It really gives you the opportunity to have a snap shot into Chris and Tracy’s life on their alpaca farm.

Sure will come back next time"
35660705,548749180,2019-10-18,7472957,Megan And Yong Hoon (Jimmy),"Tracy's place was exactly as pictured. The setting felt very tranquil and the fireplace was so lovely, even in October. We were warmly welcomed by the hosts and given an informative  tour  of the Alpaca farm. Our toddler loved the outdoor space!"

35660705,553345511,2019-10-24,11738296,Rachel,"Tracy and her husband, Chris were fantastic and friendly hosts. They met us in arrival and were prompt in communicating with us and accommodating our late check in. We loved the opportunity to meet the alpacas and the walk of the property, there are so many wild kangaroos around. The fact that you can see the stars in the sky at night also really brings home the fact that you’re away in the country! <br/><br/>The bnb is comfortable and fitted out well with beautiful furnishings (some made with alpaca fur, which can be purchased), also there is a full-functioning kitchen with utensils and ingredients for preparing meals. Tracy very generously left bacon and eggs for us in the fridge so we had breakfast in the bnb both mornings while we stayed there. Location-wise we were well placed to cover both Hahndorf and Barossa, both about half an hour away give or take.<br/><br/>We had a great time and would recommend this bnb to anyone who wants a farm stay away from the city, in the quiet of the country."
35660705,555687180,2019-10-27,139547303,Elise,We had an amazing stay with our host Tracy. We loved every minute of it.

35660705,558392399,2019-11-03,24894488,Miriam,"Tracy's place is just divine, an amazing country retreat - we didn't want to leave! Tracy is so welcoming and warm, the house is gorgeous, so comfortable, spacious and very stylish (we adored the super soft fluffy towels and the super comfy bed!). We went on an amazing walk with Tracy around the property, accompanied by her three gorgeous dogs and saw kangaroos and fed the lovely alpacas - it was the best Sunday morning we've had and really slept so late in the mornings as the property is so peaceful and quiet. We will definitely come back - would highly recommend. Thanks Tracy x"

35660705,567205392,2019-11-21,298149997,Timothy,"Staying at the fantastic place of Tracy and Chris was a wholesome and wonderful experience. They are so kind and nice hosts and we felt at home immediately. The separate house for guests is spacious, well equipped and super cosy. Interacting with the Alpacas was really fun and we got to learn a lot about them in the process. There‘d be so many more great things to write about our stay but best thing you just go and visit them yourself. Highly recommend staying there to anyone!"

35660705,568828947,2019-11-24,176310098,Imalka,It is one of the most family friendly places we ever stayed. All of us including my 1 year had a great time walking around and feeding Alpacca's.<br/><br/>One of the highlights is seeing millions of stars under night sky. It is so beautiful as there is absolutely no light pollution and it is something we all enjoyed which we can not do in the city.<br/> <br/>I would highly recommend to stay at Gundaroo in the Barossa Valley.
35660705,569885173,2019-11-27,1597476,Daniel,"We loved our stay at Gundaroo Cottage. Tracy and Christ are delightful as are the herd of alpacas across the field. Highly recommended for a friendly, local and relaxed AirBnB experience. Thanks again!"

35660705,578222989,2019-12-17,72064842,Julie,It was a peaceful and relaxed stay but also centre to many of the area’s attractions. This gave us the chance to either rest and recuperate or tour and sight see. The alpacas were a bonus!
35660705,580010950,2019-12-22,59216721,Ann,Chris & Tracy are amazing hosts & have done fabulous  restoration to the farm and home.

35660705,584989528,2019-12-30,182194725,Savanthi,"This is one of our best holidays ever. We were made to feel at home from the time we got off our vehicle. We loved every minute we spent at the farm. The accommodation is simple, elegant, stylish and homely. Tracey and Chris are truly super super hosts. They did a lot more than what we expected to make our stay beautiful. We loved being outdoor with the Alpacas, watching the sunset ( stunning indeed) , the quiet personified space, the local tips and the generosity of the hosts. Our daughter loved spending time outdoors in the tractor and being a little helper to Chris. ( not so sure if she actually helped)Tracey for taking her time off to escort us. Well I can go on and on, you got to stay here to really experience as words are not sufficient to explain !"
35660705,586496823,2020-01-01,7485599,Karina,"Tracy and Chris’ Airbnb is the perfect place for a relaxing getaway. The accommodation is located in the middle of several South Australian iconic areas including the Barossa Valley, Claire Valley, Adelaide Hills and Lobethal. <br/>We were warmly welcomed by both Chris and Tracy who graciously introduced  us to their beautiful property and alpacas! We even got to feed them which was a fun experience. <br/>The Airbnb was clean, tidy and fully equipped. We much appreciated the stocked fridge of breakfast supplies and bottle of wine! For anything else, shops were a short drive away. <br/><br/>I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing farm stay."

Tracy and Chris were absolutely wonderful hosts, and we really enjoyed our time at their AirBnB.  <br/><br/>We LOVED visiting and feeding the alpacas - they have such unique, interesting personalities!! Tracy took us on a tour around the property, and helped us set up a wine tour, which was perfect :-) We got to see some wild kangaroos on the property - very cool (except for the fact that they like to eat the grass, so maybe not so fun for the lawn). We also had an amazing BBQ dinner one night, and their 2 sweet doggos finally warmed up to us enough to hold for a bit (which I loved, because I missed my pup back home!)!<br/><br/>The renovations they have done on this property are amazing, they have a photo album to show what things looked like when they first bought it, and wow - very impressive! Excellent style choices for the renovations and decor!<br/><br/>Overall, a very fun, relaxing stay, and we would highly recommend this location to anyone! Thank you Chris and Tracy!!! <3"

35660705,597560707,2020-01-25,23316314,Melissa,"Tracy & Chris are such lovely people! They were a pleasure to get to know. It was our first time to Adelaide and they were definitely a contributing factor in making it an unforgettable experience. <br/><br/>The Airbnb was very stylish and homey. The beds were super comfortable and the amenities were very clean. <br/><br/>The highlight was being able to spend time with their adorable alpacas, dogs and cat. They took the time to educate us about the alpacas, and allowed us to pet and feed them. We must’ve taken thousands of pictures as they are incredibly cute. <br/><br/>I would strongly recommend staying at this Airbnb as not only was the location convenient, but the experience is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had through Airbnb.<br/><br/>PS If you have the opportunity to see the property you will see how perfect they are in being contestants on The Block! Make sure you pester them about it, particularly Chris. He’ll get the hint soon enough."

They had everything thought of for our stay ( stocked kitchen,towels, full use of the kitchen, games , tv, fan , heater etc)Thank you fit the lovely bottle of wine  . I probably had the best sleep ever thanks to their amazing bed and even the couch was so soft and really comfy . The highlight of the stay was of course interacting with the alpacas , feeding and petting them . Tracy took a lot of time explaining all about Alpacas since we knew nothing much about them coming from Singapore.  They also have 2 very cute dogs and a friendly cat who allowed us to pet them as well .  I only wish we could have stayed on longer . One night is not enough in this wonderful place . Tracy and Chris are just such incredible people and I can’t wait to stay there again and hopefully be able to drop by soon to see the alpaca babies!  Once again, thank you Chris and Tracy and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours . ♥️"

And Tracy was more than happy to show us the animals and let us feed them.  The two dogs and cat also came to visit us which I loved. Super friendly hosts! We felt very welcomed. There are also alot of wild kangaroos on the property which is a plus. Perfect place for an animal lover like me. Will definitely be back again.

35660705,639648424,2020-07-18,243858295,Aron,Tracy and Chris are wonderful hosts that made us feel at ease and at home. They provided all the basic amenities and gave us a tour around the alpaca farm which was the highlight of our trip.

My wife and I will definitely be back.
35660705,641544336,2020-07-24,38525124,Camilla,Great stay. Tracy was a wonderful host. The beautiful sunset on the farm and spending time with the alpacas were both highlights

We can't wait to come back and sit on the couch by the fire with a glass of wine and watch the alpacas."
35660705,646107652,2020-08-03,24389765,Cassandra,Tracy and Chris were excellent hosts and the cottage is beautifully appointed. We had the best time interacting with their alpacas and would definitely come to stay again.

35660705,653300814,2020-08-19,193408358,Adam,This was the perfect place for a relaxing getaway out of the city. The house was lovely and cosy and the fireplace was already burning when we arrived which was so nice. The views of the farm and the alpacas from the house were beautiful and relaxing. The drive to the property was stunning and we saw so many kangaroos and farm animals. At night you can hear the crickets which is so beautiful. Only 30 mins from Angaston for a day trip and only 10 mins from a few other lovely towns. Would 100% recommend this place!
35660705,655819480,2020-08-24,105544039,Tegan,Amazing stay! Would highly recommend! This place is really not far from the city but feels so quiet and relaxing. We loved being close to the Barossa region and spent time exploring the local wineries. However we also loved being able to just relax in front of the fireplace and look out at the view. Definitely a perfect place for a winter getaway but would also be great to visit in summer. The alpacas of course are so gorgeous and truly a highlight! We were able to wander around the farm and see all the alpacas whenever we wanted. Tracy and Chris also took us for a walk around and let us feed the alpacas before we left which was fantastic! The place was clean and had all the amenities we needed with extra touches like breakfast a bottle of wine and plenty of firewood. We will be back!
35660705,657167277,2020-08-28,303567690,Jessica,Amazing! <br/>Highly recommend this beautiful place! <br/>Tracy and Chris were excellent host & went above and beyond to make our stay extra special (even helping my partner plan his proposal) Not only was the place neat & tidy we arrived to have the fire on keeping the place nice and cozy for us. Tracy took us to feed the Alpaca and show us around! We can’t wait to bring our family back as the kids will love it & we look forward to making this our yearly anniversary trip! See you guys soon!

We had terrible wet weather so missed out on meeting the alpacas up close but it was still lovely to sit inside in front of the roaring fire with a glass of wine."

35660705,669262689,2020-09-29,52851714,Martin,"We had an absolutely wonderful trip, the house had all the amenities we needed, the wood fire was cosy in the cool weather and we even toasted some marshmallows on it. All the essentials like oil, salt, rice, pepper etc were there and were even provided with bacon, eggs and milk. They also have a Nespresso machine! We loved waking up in the morning, having a leisurely breakfast on the deck with the sun beaming down on us. Then going for a beautiful walk through the farm, and giving the animals a pat. We traveled with our six year old who thought it was the best holiday ever because Tracy kindly took her for a ride on the tractor, we also loved taking the baby Alpacas for a walk on the lead, they are really cute and funny!! There are lots of kangaroos around the property as well who would race us in our car! Chris and Tracy were the best hosts ever, always made sure we had everything we needed and topped up our firewood every day. The house is about 10 minutes to Gumeracha and Birdwood which was fun visiting the big rocking horse and the Birdwood motor museum. There were also lots of board games in the cupboard which was a pleasant surprise. This vacation is perfect if you want a quiet getaway and love animals and nature we will be back!"
35660705,670030190,2020-10-02,16414442,Danielle,Great place for a weekend getaway! Our young family loved staying on the farm and getting to feed the alpacas! Recommended!

35660705,671392598,2020-10-04,206797083,Cody,"Chris and Tracy's place is incredibly cozy with everything you'll need to go out and explore the Barossa. Great amenities, very clean, top location (15-30 mins from each of the Barossa ""hotspots"").<br/><br/>We loved having a glass of wine (that the hosts provided for us) on the couch by the fire while listening to the rain outside on the deck.<br/><br/>If you're lucky you'll get a visit from one of the furry friends!<br/><br/>Fantastic spot and will be back if we are in the area again!"
35660705,673107980,2020-10-11,207897647,Peter,"Tracy and Chris are really lovely people and they made us feel super welcome. The house is clean, comfortable, spacious well equipped and, thanks to a very efficient wood heater and a plentiful supply of firewood, beautifully warm. The alpacas are really gorgeous and we were lucky enough to be able to watch some being shorn - a first for both of us. The location is ideal, with the entire Barossa Valley within easy reach for a day trip and the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, with lots of fascinating little villages in the opposite direction, not to mention the National Motor Museum just down the road at Birdwood. There are 3 reservoirs nearby with opportunities for fishing, walking or birdwatching. With 4 conservation parks and Mt Crawford Forest in the surrounding area there are numerous walking trails including sections of the famous Heysen Trail. We will definitely be back."

Miss the naughty George, the cute KF Panda and Gold Star already (sorry don't remember all their names but they are all super cute.)  I'm back at work in Adelaide today and have been telling all my workmates how special it was to wake up and see alpacas moving in front of your bedroom window and kangaroos hopping around in the early morning outside the kitchen window. As expected, the house is clean and comfortable, we feel very much at home. There are all essentials in the pantry with fresh milk, eggs, bacon etc. in the fridge, as well as the complimentary bottle of wine.  There is a Nespresso machine with a variety of capsules and a wide range of Twinings tea provided. Tracy is quick in responding to my messages and has done a great job in managing this Airbnb property . As a local SA resident, now that we are not encouraged to travel interstate or overseas, I highly recommend this farm stay for a special weekend getaway. Kids will love the alpacas and there are so much to do in the neighborhood: The Big Rocking Horse is only 10 minutes away and the Whispering Wall 15 minutes drive. Thank you Tracy and Chris, all the best and Merry Christmas!"

35660705,746715341,2021-04-08,40462715,Paul,"Tracy and Chris are fantastic hosts. The Airbnb was just as expected, clean and comfortable with a very homely feel. The location is fantastic, we drove to Lyndoch for wine tasting one day, Whispering Wall and Williamstown on another, the Big Rocking Horse in Gumeracha, and one day spent just relaxing at the farm. <br/>The farm itself is beautiful and tranquil - and hats off to Chris and Tracy for their hard work in maintaining the farm. We stayed with our two children, both under 5, who had an amazing time and we are so grateful to our hosts for taking the time to let us feed the alpacas and provide some insight into their lives. <br/>It was a perfect family-friendly mini getaway and would stay again, and recommend to others!<br/><br/>Note for parents - there was a portacot and high chair available, as well a small bath perfect for kids."

For those who will be driving in the dark - there are a few km’s of unsealed and unlit roads to Tracy’s place. It’s completely safe,  we did it in a tiny car but just something to be aware of. <br/><br/>Tracy and Chris had already lit the fire for us so that we’d be warm when we arrived. Their home is comfortable and spacious and met all of our needs.

The Airbnb overlooks a lovely dam and you can see a paddock full of alpacas from the deck.<br/><br/>The alpacas are absolutely wonderful and there were two gorgeous babies during our stay! They were quite comfortable with us watching them grazing and it is a definite must to head here. Cannot recommend it enough! We will definitely be back to relax and hopefully walk the alpacas when the weather is nicer 😊

Utterly professional and amazing communication <br/>A beautiful area and space <br/>Hopeful that perhaps once the ‘C’ word (both covid and cancer) are finished with- we will able to return <br/><br/>A clean and beautiful cottage design and high end finishes throughout, Amazing outdoor garden area <br/><br/>Beds- mattress where high end and pillows where amazingly soft <br/>An amazing bath/ jet bath for those sore muscles<br/><br/>We truly drove 85kms out of our way to stay the night here, and it was worth it"

36184899,628432208,2020-06-08,21896656,Lisa,"We had a great 4 nights stay. It’s a very clean and beautifully renovated/decorated cottage that has everything you need. Functional kitchen for cooking, very comfortable bed which is difficult to get out of and a large bathroom with spa bath and shower which has great pressure. A bonus for me was the hair dryer that didn’t frizz the hair. There were some breakfast supplies and my husband was pretty happy with the coffee machine. The gardens were nice and was a peaceful location. Communication with Brooke was very efficient. Highly recommend."

36184899,630462372,2020-06-18,79369859,Rachel,"This is without doubt an outstanding experience in the heart of a South Australian wine region. The property and grounds are impeccably presented and the appointment and comfort was of the highest standard we could possibly have imagined when we arrived. Not only was every space thoughtfully appointed, designed and put together it was warm, welcoming, clean and classy. We felt safe and delighted to spend some time there - our only criticism was that we did not have enough time to stay longer! <br/><br/>Our Hosts were able to help us with our activities and dinner bookings as well as providing us with assistance within minutes of inquiry. They were not only responsive, helpful and timely but so pleasant to deal with.<br/><br/>The wine and chocolate‘s were a beautiful touch, the linen on the beds perfectly crisp and of a high quality, the furniture stylish and comfortable, even the books on the bookcases were not only interesting but complimented the internal colour scheme and coordinated in hues of blue and mustard.  As an interior designer myself the property was one of the absolute best I have had the pleasure of staying in and I cannot wait to book again to spend more time with the filtered light coming through the windows and explore the plethora of interesting books. <br/><br/>Rachel and Kimberley of Torrens Park & Walkerville"

Beautifully styled, with really thoughtful touches,  really comfortable bedding and amenities within a gorgeous bluestone cottage. Brooke and Peter are superb hosts; the garden is really lovely and the location is excellent - we rode our bikes up the trail to Tanunda and back and also enjoyed walks down to the cafe and through the cemetery.   Lyndoch is a little pearl in the Barossa and this is high quality accommodation. We look forward to staying again."
36184899,645449570,2020-08-02,135180433,Jasmin,"If you’re looking for a place to stay while you explore the Barossa - look no further. The house is perfect and has so many little touches that just make your stay even better. The beds were very comfortable and the living room was perfect for reading a book, or drinking the complimentary bottle of wine while enjoying a movie. The kitchen is equipped with everything you could possibly need, and if you don’t feel like cooking there are plenty of restaurants a short drive from Lyndoch, as well as two pubs and a cafe in close proximity. It’s a perfect location for exploring local wineries and eateries, while also enjoying the serenity of a quiet country town. Brooke and Peter are lovely hosts and happily helped us when we accidentally locked ourselves out. Can’t wait to stay here again for our next Barossa adventure!"

36184899,714186662,2020-12-07,78252652,Leigh,"Absolutely delightful stay in this beautiful fully restored cottage. The thoughtful extra touches and ammenities was beyond expectations. Hubby and I are huge animal lovers and it was great to feed the 2 possums that live in the outside wine cellar and come out at night in the almond tree to greet you. The cottage was cosy and homely and everything was so thoughtfully thought out. Breakfast cereal packets in the cupboard, coffee pods, cartons of milk, butter, other condiments and bathroom ammenities were all at hand if wanted, those touches are what sets this place above others. Our first experience staying at an Airbnb and we worried as to what we should expect but was definitely beyond all expectations, Brooke was only a message away if we needed her and she was always prompt and helpful with our questions. I have recommended this cottage to family and friends for their next stay in the Barossa. If your looking for a home base in the Barossa then you can’t go past Ironstone on Jollytown, trust me you will not be disappointed especially if you love animals and want to interact with Jolly the possum and her mate. Thankyou Brooke and Peter for a beautiful week at the Barossa ☺️ xx"

36184899,744815999,2021-04-03,65163364,Deb,"Brooke and Peter’s place is a beautiful old stone cottage which has been sensitively preserved; this however doesn’t mean it isn’t equipped with everything you’ll need during your stay. The kitchenette is well kitted out and the cereals, porridge, condiments, tea and coffee provided are a wonderful addition, particularly if you just want to grab a quick breakfast at home before heading out exploring. The bed was comfortable, the shower powerful (always a bonus) and the toiletries provided left you feeling and smelling amazing. Lastly Lyndoch provides a great place to explore the Barossa from and there are also cafes and wineries within walking distance (check out God’s Hill wines, highly recommend it!) as well as a few places to eat at night if you don’t fancy venturing far."

36498929,658087142,2020-08-30,92052096,Annie,Maz’s home is the perfect place to base yourself for a weekend in the Barossa. So close to Tanunda’s Main Street restaurants and shops and not far from heaps of great wineries. <br/><br/>The house is clean and tidy with plenty of comfy touches- however we recommend bringing a torch as the interior lighting can be confusing and some lights don’t work. <br/><br/>The front porch is a great place to unwind with a local wine after a busy day tasting! We would definitely stay here again!

36498929,750234564,2021-04-19,100853093,Lesley,The location is perfect as it is within a short walk to all cafes and bars.  The home is very comfortable and very welcoming.  It is also the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed in.  The breakfast provisions provided were plentiful and the choice was fantastic from cereal to the full egg and bacon breakfast.  I truly recommend this home to anyone that wants to stay in Tanunda as you do not want for anything.

36498929,758567423,2021-05-15,39194115,Bee,"I stayed at Maz's lovely home for 3 nights on the main street of Tanunda while my team and I were hiking the Heysen Trail for the Jodi Lee Foundation Trek. <br/><br/>It was a perfect central location as we were travelling throughout the Barossa on various points along the Heysen Trail. It was very nice to be within walking distance to the restaurants, supermarket and shops. <br/><br/>The home itself is cosy, clean and full of homely touches. I appreciated the artwork on the walls which show the personality of the hosts. We did not cook meals apart from breakfast, but the kitchen was well appointed and had everything we needed. I appreciated the provision of breakfast items which came in handy as we started very early in the morning before the shops opened, so thank you very much! <br/><br/>The beds were very comfortable and the heaters were a lifesaver on these cool autumn evenings. There was plenty of hot water for 4 adults and having towels provided was great as it lessened the amount of items I had to pack. <br/><br/>We only stayed a few days but for longer stays there was plenty of wardrobe space, use of a washing machine and dryer. <br/><br/>Maz has put a lot of thought into anticipating her guests' needs and she was in close contact with me throughout my stay which made me feel looked after. <br/><br/>I would definitely consider her property if I am staying in the Barossa in future."
36498929,760010676,2021-05-19,34823454,Scott,"Great location, close walk to main road with restaurants, cafes and shops. House was clean and had an extra touch with Maz providing ingredients for a cooked breaky, as well as milk and juice.We will return for our next trip to the Barossa."

The amazing wineries and other places of interest, including Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop, were a short drive away. <br/>The kitchen was great and had everything you needed to cook a great meal if you didn’t want to eat out. Having said that, we made great use of the pubs and restaurants in town.<br/>We had some really chilly nights, but we put on the heating as soon as we walked through the door each evening and as soon as we had changed into our track pants and sweatshirts the place was as warm as toast. The bed was so comfy that we both slept in well past our normal wake up time. Bliss!<br/>All in all, we felt like we were home away from home. We only wished we could have stayed longer.<br/>Thanks so much for a fantastic stay Maz."

Maz was very helpful with suggestions and questions beforehand (especially with us changing our booking a couple of times) and lives very close for any problems. <br/>The place itself is big and everything functions: we even managed to do some cooking on Christmas Day! As with most older houses, a few creaky floors, a bit of dust under the beds etc, but overall clean and nicely presented. There are air conditioning units in the shared areas and front bedroom, and ceiling fans throughout, making it quite easy to cool the second bedroom and keep it cool. <br/><br/>A small note about the area, but a lot of things were closed over the Christmas period. We still had plenty to do and see, but if there are specific places you want to visit in the Barossa, it's worth checking out what their holiday opening hours are.<br/><br/>All in all, we had a lovely stay."

36774681,590211573,2020-01-07,14319675,Alysha,"Our stay at the little cottage was amazing! It has been restored very tastefully and has everything you could want in a relaxing setting. The plunge pool was exceptional and we made good use of it! The beds were super comfy and the linen and towels were high quality. We really enjoyed the cellar and the opportunity to try some of the wines grown and made at the vineyard. The house is in a great location, walking distance to Murray Street. We would absolutely stay again - fantastic, friendly hosts, always happy to share their local recommendations. Thank you Jan, Craig and Scott."
36774681,590919198,2020-01-10,14529801,Dani,"If we could give this place 6 stars, we would. The view is spectacular and the cottage has been beautifully renovated. The plunge pool is an absolute treat! Scott was incredibly accomodating and it was great talking with him about his vineyard and wines (which are amazing!)."
36774681,597609347,2020-01-26,65976620,Varda,"If we could have given Rogasch Cottage 10 stars we would have!  A superb little gem hidden away amongst the vines within 5 minutes walking distance to the main street bustling with cafe's and restaurants.  Scott was such a welcoming host along with Jan and Craig - nothing was too much trouble.  We enjoyed a private tour of the micro-vineyard as well as joining them fo (Website hidden by Airbnb) on our first night.  Beautifully renovated, the Cottage is a mix of old and new with all the luxuries one could ever ask for along with your very own stocked cellar.  Wine, local gin, chocolate and even a litre of milk in the fridge welcomed us on our arrival.   Carefully thought through touches make this place an absolute must stay.  Watching sunset in the plunge pool is something we will remember for a long time.  We were sad to leave but are already planning on a return stay!  Outstanding Air BnB :)"
36774681,599630076,2020-01-30,307126948,Nigel,Very comfortable cottage in a great location. Worth a stay just to watch the sunset from the pool.
36774681,600486121,2020-02-01,19082,Alana,This place is amazing! Staying here really made our trip to the Barossa extra special. The plunge pool with views over the vineyards was a highlight and my partner also had fun on the driving range next to the house. Each night you can go down into your private cellar and choose a bottle of wine which was a lovely touch. We cooked in the old fire oven on the balcony but there's also a fully equiped kitchen. There's local gins to taste with capi tonic in the fridge. Also chocolate! and milk for your nespresso is all provided. We never wanted to leave the house. It's also only 5 mins walk from town and close by to so many good wineries. Even though you're right in the thick of it you feel miles away. This would have to be one of my favourite airbnb's I've ever stayed in.
36774681,602171830,2020-02-05,239854999,Tanner,"Absolutely phenomenal place... nuff said...<br/>Gorgeous view, great place for good times.<br/><br/><br/>Jan, Craig , and Scott where awesome people very down to earth and relatable.<br/><br/>Can’t thank them enough for offering up this place!!"
36774681,606067481,2020-02-15,234928036,Brandon,"The cottage is setup to take advantage of the amazing vineyard views, it’s so relaxing either on the couch or in the pool. Was really happy with the quality of the appliances and furnishings. Retrieving a night cap from the cellar was a real novelty. Its walking distance from the coffee shops and restaurants on the main street which made it so easy after a night enjoying a couple of glasses of wine. Would definitely recommend a stay here."
36774681,609425968,2020-02-23,277750041,Camille,"If ever near the Barossa, look no further for accommodation...this place has it all. Perfect place to rest and relax with stunning views, sunsets and plunge pool!"
36774681,613833181,2020-03-03,55522830,Sydney,"Amazing renovated cottage in the heart of Barossa within walking distance of Tanunda’s main street. <br/>Every detail is thoughtfully taken care of and the facilities are of a very high standard. <br/>The hosts, Jan, Craig, Scott are very inviting and always available when required. <br/>Ten stars out of five."
36774681,616153107,2020-03-08,45124734,Tamara,"The place is lovely. Small, but high quality bed linen, modern features and views to die for. The pool was utterly gorgeous and everything was thought of down to kitchen provisions and the cool choose your own cellar feature.<br/><br/>Do I think it was worth $700 a night for a relatively small space that is basically an annex to next door? No. On our first night, I returned home to find a man urinating outside the property....witnessed by my small children and he was so drunk he splayed his genitalia around-they were upset to say the least. I contacted the host immediately who said he’d look into it...yet we received no response. This was utterly unacceptable. <br/><br/>The house needs to be advertised as a tack on to the main house, there isn’t a lot of room or privacy, but the views, cellar (be careful of the door, my partner received a black eye as it dropped down on his face) were super cool. Great location 3/5 stars $1,400 a weekend? Totally overpriced."
36774681,618915274,2020-03-16,101597463,Simon,"Perfect place to explore the Barossa from, the location is a walk to the village and a short drive to most vineyards. The property is a tasteful mix of modern and period and very nicely finished. The pool and cellar are great touches, we loved our stay here"
36774681,619553478,2020-03-18,91389399,Brie,We absolutely loved our stay! The vineyard views were stunning and we loved the amazing spa and celler! The extra details such as complimentary wine and chocolate were lovely! We can’t wait to come back!

Scott and family went above and beyond - appreciated the wine tasting, quick responses to anything, the bedding was beautiful, heated pool was  fabulous and really appreciated such a thoughtful and unexpected birthday present.

36774681,634667528,2020-07-04,349710449,Jamie,"Amazing location situated right in the heart of everything but still secluded and private. The cottage was absolutely beautiful and had so many added extras we never expected. High end bedding, towels and furniture made it feel like a luxury resort. Pool was a real winner for us with amazing views. Scott was absolutely amazing, couldn’t have asked for anyone better. He was so friendly and helpful organising us a tour of a winery close by and giving us a private tasting of his micro winery on the property. Would 100% recommend to everyone and we will definitely be back again!"
36774681,636314587,2020-07-10,179664837,Jennifer,"What a fabulous place! Everything you need to feel relaxed: beautiful views, heated pool, open fire, coffee and wine.  Conveniently close to everything but with privacy as well as lots of space to explore. The owners have done an excellent job with the finer details including beautiful linen, and also creating special spots to sit and relax both inside and out."
36774681,637006996,2020-07-11,39794726,Brooke,"We loved our stay so much, we can’t wait to organise another stay towards the end of the year as there really wasn’t enough time to enjoy how much your beautiful place has to offer!"
36774681,643125882,2020-07-27,257454628,Sarah,"Absolutely beautiful place and location. So much more than we expected, definitely worth the cost. The wine tasting and tour of the property with Scott and Craig, just made our last night so special. It was great to hear and see the history and taste the wine that has been produced from the vines we looked over during our stay. Perfect location in Tanunda, close to town but also very private, and the house is just spectacular."
36774681,649244309,2020-08-10,55980333,Luke,"This place is far better than the pictures show... Which is hard to believe.<br/>Everything was perfect, and the free wine, gin and port was the icing on the cake.<br/>The heated pool was unbelievable, we spent all day there.<br/><br/>And to top it off a free wine tasting, all Scott's wine were awesome, we are looking forward to purchasing some bottles when this vintage is released.<br/><br/>11/10 <br/>Don't miss out on Booking this place!"

36774681,654015102,2020-08-21,101776612,Kym,Great place. Location is fantastic. Scotty was friendly and we enjoyed the wine tasting. Wish we went when it was warmer and less rain so we could enjoy the patio more.

36774681,656220058,2020-08-25,41241832,Dieter,"We had an amazing time at Scott's cottage! There are countless little gems throughout the accommodation from the amazing views in the heated pool to the private cellar stocked with wine made from the property's produce. We also did a tasting with Scott and really loved the experience. We couldn't have asked for a more relaxing experience, with our goal of getting out of the city. Looking forward to visiting again!"
36774681,660031152,2020-09-04,10719245,Rebekah,"Gorgeous spot. Highlights were the hot tub overlooking the vineyard, the fireplace and the little wine cellar. Lovely."
36774681,661974901,2020-09-08,329547467,Laura,"An absolutely gorgeous cottage in such a peaceful spot - you wouldn’t know you were only a minute from the main street. The plunge pool was as warm as a bath with beautiful views, and the cottage itself was bright & airy whilst maintaining the character and charm of the original home. <br/>Can’t wait to come back the next time we visit the Barossa."
36774681,664972584,2020-09-16,2975011,Nicole,"Fab stay! The plunge pool was amazing (and heated to 35 degrees!). Inside was stunning, cellar was cute and the bath tub! Wow!  <br/>Netflix on the TV, Nespresso machine and only a short stroll to town It’s perfect!"
36774681,665905465,2020-09-19,139383519,Alysha,"We had the most amazing time. The pool and driving range were the highlights and we loved the location. My only recommendation would be some more basic pantry staples (butter, vegemite, cereals, etc) as this would have made our stay that little bit more convenient ☺️"
36774681,668929452,2020-09-28,356136929,Andrew,Amazing location and host. My partner and I had such a great time. From the beautiful plunge pool overlooking the vineyards to having our own cellar the weekend was just wonderful.

36774681,673689235,2020-10-12,3455767,Sarah,"With an excellent location just off the Tanunda Main Street, Rogasch Cottage is just the right balance of comfort, style, privacy and personal touches in a superbly renovated old cottage that will surprise and delight! Our young family enjoyed an indulgent weekend complete with sunset swims, vineyard views and cosy fires and found this to be the perfect setting to relax at the end of a busy day. Equally we could have stayed put the whole time with more than adequate amenities for self-catering and generally relaxing and unwinding in luxe surrounds. Scott was quick to respond to enquiries and went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed. The micro tasting on the property was an absolute highlight and a nightcap in the cellar before bed time was not to be missed! Don’t deliberate. Just book!"
36774681,702247449,2020-10-20,235097248,Philip,"This place was amazing, awesome views the pictures don’t to it justice. Positioned close to everything, although you won’t want to leave this little oasis. Will be returning for sure."
36774681,702630693,2020-10-22,54953384,Andy,"A truly luxurious home that provided wonderful relaxation at the end of each day. All the homely touches including the gin, muscat, and wine samples by the private pool made it the highlight of the trip. Additionally, we found the house to be walking distance from anywhere in Tanunda including Turkey Flat winery.<br/><br/>I’d recommend the house to any as a staycation destination in itself, with trips out to the wineries as a bonus add-on."
36774681,703460476,2020-10-25,371884858,Brandon,"Perfect getaway spot at tanunda in barossa valley looking over the vineyard with a nice glass of wine from there private wine cellar is one of a kind. The heated 35 degree spa is amazing with the view. Gorgeous cottage to take the next step for a romatic proposal, nonetheless 5 star and couldnt ask for a better place to stay."
36774681,704360936,2020-10-27,71599778,Alex,"What a place!! From the kangaroos between the vines in the morning, to using the old bread oven for stone baked pizza in the evening. It’s an amazing place... and super close to Tanunda town centre. It was everything we hoped it would be and couldn’t give a higher recommendation. Scott makes some incredible wines too!!"
36774681,705572728,2020-10-31,277451306,Kelsi,Absolutely LOVELY getaway. The thoughtful touches around the house and efforts made by the hosts made the experience even better. Craig was an absolute legend for taking us around the vineyard for a wine tour. His hospitality was excellent and to take time out of his day to show us around didn’t go unappreciated. The place itself was stunning and very comfortable. It was just the perfect place to spend some time with my family for the weekend. My parents were even more impressed with the experience than I was. I’m so glad we were able to support such a deserving family on this stay! 10/10 stay!!

36774681,714614852,2020-12-10,88420405,Tracey,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay.<br/>We had the best of both worlds. <br/>Week started off quite chilly,  so was great to sit by fireplace at night with  wine out of the cottage cellar ( 1 bottle a day included in stay), and then the weather became quite warm by end of our stay,  so was fantastic sitting in hot tub overlooking the vineyards.<br/>The beds are so comfortable,  we slept like babies.<br/>There is an outdoor bbq, plus an outdoor pizza oven.<br/>We were able to walk around the property and into the vineyards, and Scott ( the host) even gave us a wine tasting from the barrels, and from the bottled wine.<br/>5 min walk into main st of Tanunda.<br/>Can't wait to stay here again"
36774681,715813061,2020-12-16,345431238,Kayla,"My wife and I were very much looking forward to rounding off our honeymoon with a few nights at Rogasch Cottage, and we weren’t disappointed. Every element of this stay is superbly thought out, from the coffee selections, having both beach and bath towels, TV and aircon in every room, and wine for each night you stay. We had a real blast doing the wine tasting with Scott, and even had the privilege of buying some AMAZING wine they produced on the property. Though an expensive stay, there is not a single cent wasted and we will definitely come back in the future. Well done guys! Elijah and Kayla"

Scott was a fantastic host he was prompt and very thorough with communicating to us and we were lucky to go on his micro brewery tour and learnt about his wine making and history about the cottage and vineyard. The view was amazing and the plunge pool was amazing. Everything listed was perfect and couldn’t have asked for a better stay. We will be recommending this to our friends and family.
36774681,722667455,2021-01-08,12189346,Predrag,"An amazing place, location, host and experience. Would gladly go back and will make sure to look for the wine brands in the future. Many thanks for an awesome time."

36774681,730272285,2021-02-10,4194666,Marc,"From start to finish it was a memorable stay. Scott helped me get in touch with a local boutique florist and when they delivered it prior to checkin, Scott placed them in a vase in the perfect spot. <br/>The plunge pool is pure bliss and always warm. Once you get in, you’ll struggle wanting to leave. Not only is the view of the vineyards iconic; but also the lack of light pollution at night gives you a beautiful look into the nights stars. <br/>There were many amazing touches, from a stocked wine cellar with a complimentary bottle, to a tipple of local gin. <br/>Thank you for hosting us!"

36774681,736596410,2021-03-06,50119451,Richard,"A beautiful cottage which is both very comfortable and nicely appointed. <br/><br/>The cottage / location has an interesting history (documented on-site) and a certain charm as a result. It’s quite remote (right on the edge of town) and is close to nature. The night skies (when cloudless) are spectacular.<br/><br/>It’s in a good location (Tanunda and it’s restaurants are in walking distance). The great views, plunge pool, usable fireplaces and wine cellar make it extra special.<br/><br/>Scott and Jan are hospitable hosts with a range of nice touches thrown in."

I loved the touch of a personal cellar supplied by the owners, and the spacious design of the cottage. <br/><br/>We were lucky enough to have a tour and private tasting of the Forage Supply Co wine list grown on the property which was a highlight of our stay, if you get a chance, make sure you do it too. <br/>I would highly recommend this property to anybody looking for a central, relaxing and picturesque base to their Barossa adventure."

The cottage is well equipped, stylishly & thoughtfully furnished. From the beautiful fresh roses, local gins to taste and private cellar it really did not disappoint!!  A honeymoon and birthday to remember. We came with our one year old daughter and it was perfect for dips in the pool when she was asleep or walking into town for an early dinner and a few wines. A quick drive to endless wineries. A week well spent!"

From the amazing hospitality to all of the special touches set up for guests we couldn’t have asked for anything more. We were lucky enough to be able to experience a special wine tasting on site and get to know the owners of the property which really made the trip special for us. The location is absolutely perfect, we were able to walk down to the main street of Tanunda for dinner each night which was great. 2 nights certainly wasn’t long enough!"

A redeveloped cottage with a fascinating history. Amenities are top class if you would like to stay in and cook for yourself, however you are located within 10 minute drive of some beautiful restaurants and vineyards for some world class wine tasting. The stunning pool overlooking the vineyard on a nice day is not only picturesque but remarkably pleasant. Scott is a warm, enthusiastic host, with a great story to tell, and some beautiful wine to share. Highly recommended!"
36774681,748792074,2021-04-15,389048915,Tanya,"Our stay far exceeded our expectations!<br/><br/>The cottage was absolutely beautiful. Restoration has considered and upheld the historical nature of the property, while adding a touch of modernness and elegance to comfort.<br/><br/>The hot-tub/plunge pool was exquisite and very well thought out.<br/><br/>We loved spending time with beautiful Paws while she waited for the family. She is truly the most beautiful Border Collie, and clearly very loved!<br/><br/>We would love to walk the grounds when we can make it back. There is so much that we didn't get the time to explore.<br/><br/>We will definitely return!"

Old heritage bones with classic modern updates throughout, a golf tee-off (into the vines below!) with local tastings and wine provided! <br/><br/>Sunset and sunrise in the spa was my favorite, the beds are comfy, the fireplace was a cozy touch, and the scenery and peace was more than we could have hoped for. <br/><br/>Thanks to the hosts! We’d love to come back again someday and stay longer ❤️"
36774681,758589753,2021-05-16,174828710,Joel,"Great place to stay for the weekend.Amazing views, so close to the town centre for shops and restaurants. Great place all around, would recommend"
36774681,760487020,2021-05-20,86210918,Claudia,"Fantastic place with rich history! Far exceeded our expectations, photos don’t do it justice! Had a lovely tour of the property complete with wine tasting and drinks by the fire, highlight of our trip! Would highly recommend. Thanks again Scott, Craig and Jan!!"
36774681,761212402,2021-05-23,132748727,Kris,"You will not be disappointed.<br/>Accommodation - attention to detail is on point. From the minute we walked in, we all thought WOW!<br/>Quality of bedding and towels will not go unnoticed.<br/>Hot Tub - she lives up to her name, water was beautifully warm and the view is incredible.<br/>Communication - Scott and Jane respond promptly, you are never left hanging. They absolutely get 5 stars for customer service.<br/>Lastly, location - it’s perfect as the Main Street is just a small stroll down the road.<br/>It’s a gem to be enjoyed."
36774681,762923637,2021-05-27,165326358,Matthew,This is probably the best Air BNB we have ever stayed in. If you think the photos are amazing the actual experiencis even better. This is the perfect Tanunda accomodation. Look no further.
36774681,763569298,2021-05-29,91626659,Joel,Great cottage really close to town. Perfect little getaway. You think you are miles from anywhere but town is a short walk away. The cottage is really well done. A perfect mix of old style and modern comforts. Ideal for a couple or a family of 3 to 4.
36774681,765786364,2021-06-03,43554596,Vicky,"This is the most exceptional Airbnb we’ve ever stayed in! The cottage was adorable and exquisitely set up. It’s worth staying just for the hot tub, but then there’s the view, the short walk to Tanunda Main Street, the personal cellar stocked with wine for us to enjoy and the fireplace as well! Very special. Craig, our host, took us to the winery’s magnificent cellar, where we had a tasting and a fabulous yarn or two for the afternoon. And if you can tear yourself away from the cottage, the Barossa is one of Australia’s premium wine destinations. Enjoy! 🍷"
36774681,768477557,2021-06-10,8741396,Rachel,"This is more than a place to sleep, it is an experience! We got engaged at this property and the owners went above and beyond to set the place up for my fiancé with flowers, a grazing board, fire ready and sparkling Shiraz. We also enjoyed the included gin and port tasting, the selection of wine available in the cellar, the golf course off the balcony into the vines and of course the spa! I was surprised how close this is to town - only a 5min walk and one street over from the main restaurant strip. It really is the best of both worlds - looking out at the view you would not know you are right in town.<br/><br/>We went on a winery tour of the property and were inspired by the great work Scott is doing for the community with his boutique brand. He even arranged for a Port Adelaide player to hand sign wine with a note for our engagement and dropped it at our next accommodation after we checked out. My partner lives as breathes Port Adelaide and will cherish this for a long time!"
36774681,770329171,2021-06-14,45063120,Kylie,"Stunning location, gorgeous cottage. Water pressure in the shower was fantastic. Beds super comfy. Constant supply of firewood for the open fireplace. Loved every second of our stay!"
36774681,390135656631221357,2021-06-22,75135,Alison,"Everything about this place is beautiful, with fantastic attention to detail in every way. The cottage is a short and pretty stroll to the main street and has stunning vineyard views. The fireplace, hot tub, bath with a view and private cellar make for a unique stay in a beautiful part of the Barossa. Check-in/out was convenient, and Scott is a wonderful host."
36774681,391540272220080422,2021-06-24,2072865,Jamie,"The Ultimate Barossa Accommodation! The whole 2 night getaway at Rogasch Cottage was flawless. <br/>Scott is fast to respond and easy to communicate with. <br/>The cottage will exceed your expectations, it is perfectly clean, stylishly decorated, the beds are large and very comfortable, the heating works quickly at making the place cosy and the hot tub and the view over the vineyard is beautiful. Add in the very cool little cellar with lovely reds, muscat and tawny to taste, the gins to sample, a fire place, golf tee off next to the hot tub and the close proximity to cafes, pubs and restaurants (10 min walk), this place comes pretty close to unbeatable for a Barossa getaway."
36774681,394487913317515625,2021-06-28,49915738,Ashlea,"Stay here! It is absolutely beautiful and a comfortable place to stay. Communication was quick, nice extra touches, king size beds. So accomodating I can’t recommend more. I would stay here again"
36774681,397337691157794400,2021-07-02,60439166,Jen,Could not recommend this stay more - The hot tub was exceptional and doing a wine tasting with Scott was definitely a highlight. The cottage had everything we needed and exceeded all expectations! Only wish we could have stayed longer but will hopefully be back soon!
36774681,398749667723149833,2021-07-04,83009158,Nicole,"The cottage was beautiful. Just a lovely place to spend a rainy winter’s weekend - nice and toasty by the fire with gorgeous views across the vineyard. Even went for a dip in the lovely warm pool. The place has been cleverly designed and has everything you need to feel at home. Hospitality is above and beyond with lovely gin tastings and sneaky blocks of chocolate. Scott was very accommodating of our small humans who had a great time roaming the property for golf balls, patting the friendly doggo and screaming at the chickens (chickens probably feel differently). We will definitely be back.  Maybe without the kids next time."
36774681,402416086166303877,2021-07-09,387451101,Jon,"The cottage is fantastic. Watching the sunset from the plunge pool is a nice way to end the day. We walked to dinner, and were within easy reach of some great wineries (and a brewery)."
36774681,403881670201730762,2021-07-11,38230822,Joanna,"This is an incredible place to stay. The little extras that are offered throughout the house were a wonderful touch, the hot plunge pool overlooking the vineyards was even better than expected. A beautiful place we would stay in again and again"
36774681,408915362989192218,2021-07-18,179664837,Jennifer,Our second stay and despite the wild winter weather we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and made good use of the heated pool and open fireplaces.

The renovated 1860’s cottage is absolutely stunning, with the best blend of heritage charm and modern luxury. The vineyard views from the rear deck and hot tub are amazing, not to mention the delicious wine. Our tour of the winery with Scott was fantastic and we definitely look forward to coming back soon!"

36774681,484335356341692125,2021-10-30,170701069,Tammy,"A sensational property with equally sensational hosts. We stayed at the cottage for 3 nights and loved it! The beds were comfy, the views are incredible and the pool is the icing on the cake! They have thought of almost everything - you have everything you need. We also enjoyed a few experiences the cottage has to offer, including the micro winery tour, the fireside supper, and Craig (host) even drove us to a few wineries (how good is that for service). We also had a great time having dinner in the surprise hidden cellar which was a fun experience. I cant recommend this property highly enough. We cant wait to go back again!"
36774681,485773032506271122,2021-11-01,49852004,Sowmya,My husband and I stayed here for 2 nights over a weekend and it was fantastic. The heated plunge pool was definitely one of the highlights with the amazing view! A lot of places have “heated” pools but often is still quite cold compared to the outside weather however this was truly heated to a very comfortable temperature that you don’t have to brace yourself before going in. We enjoyed the tour of the property and the wine + gin tastings. We ended up buying some wine to support the Forage Supply Co cause.  The location was perfect to walk to all the nice cafes and restaurants in Tanunda. The house was well equiped with appliances Anand coffee/ tea. The unexpected bonus for anyone driving an EV is that there is an NRMA fast charger within walking distance of the property and the town!!! Highly recommended and we might even stay there again another time.
36774681,489417007967509665,2021-11-06,49229968,Keith,"Gorgeous property,  and amazing complimentary tastings!  Probably one of the nicest places we have stayed. We will absolutely book again.  Thank you"

Such a sweet cottage with so much history that has been refurbished nicely.

The fireplace in the front room generated a lovely amount of heat although the rear of the house tended to be on the colder end so extra blankets were required on the beds.<br/>The cottage is in a great location, close to the town’s cafes and shops and so easy to drive around to the multitude of beautiful wineries. We would happily stay again."

37926946,640345540,2020-07-20,67711579,Molly,"We had a fantastic stay at Tamu guesthouse! The hosts were very welcoming and great to communicate with. The guest house is on the edge of the Barossa Valley but not far at all to drive to wineries and restaurants. We were also able to get a taxi from Altona to go out to dinner which was very convenient. The location is super quiet which is great for relaxing - and we even got to see some kangaroos! The guesthouse has everything that you could need, is beautifully decorated and extremely clean. I definitely recommend staying at Tamu Barossa."

37926946,651786355,2020-08-16,361298303,Chris,We chose Bianca’s guest house for some tranquility and nature and that’s exactly what we got. <br/><br/>We saw lots of kangaroos and birds. We went for walks in nature at the conservation park right across the road. We saw lots of beautiful wild flowers. <br/><br/>The house is very clean and comfortable and quiet. The location is close enough to town to make it quick and convenient to jump in the car and get supplies or go out for a meal. Bianca’s dining suggestions are spot on. We had some of the best food experiences ever. <br/><br/>Bianca and her family are lovely. <br/><br/>We strongly recommend this place.

37926946,668947465,2020-09-28,140676856,Jane,"We enjoyed staying at ‘Tamu Barossa’ which looks even better in real life than the photos show.  The cabin has been upgraded, with a fully functional kitchen and quality fixtures throughout.   It is located in a quiet, private area with views onto trees.  There is a wonderful and large walking reserve just a couple of hundred metres down the road where we saw kangaroos and lots of birds.  Wineries and the sculture park are also close by.  ‘Tamu Barossa’ is located in a tucked away part of the Baroosa, often overlooked.  Bianca is a gracious and warm host and not at all intrusive.   We have no hesitation recommending her place."

The cottage is so very clean and the fixtures of high quality - why would you want to stay in a hotel when you can stay here for a fraction of the price and the ambiance it offers.  Bianca is lovely and very easy to communicate with.  The beds are so comfortable and we really appreciated the complimentary coffee pods, milk and breakfast muesli - not to mention the extra special chocolates.  We would recommend this accommodation to anyone.  Julie & Paul - Adelaide."

We did feel there were quite a lot of rules and while we of course were happy to abide by them (and probably would have behaved the same way without the rules) it was somewhat off putting. I’m not sure if there have been issues with previous guests. Other than that I can’t fault our stay and while we didn’t meet Bianca her communication was great."

A beautiful cottage located in a lovely town - was nice to wake up and walk down to brunch. <br/>It’s obvious that so much thought has gone into the place- we literally wanted for nothing for our entire stay. <br/>Cannot write a review without acknowledging the bath- it is the largest most luxurious bath I think I’ve ever used!

Disconnecting from the digital world and enjoying the moment was what we needed. The outdoor area is so lovely to sit under and enjoy a platter. That shower/bath is spot on as well.

The only negative which I had overlooked when booking was ‘no internet’.<br/>Angaston is a lovely village, with several restaurants to choose from, and if you are a cyclist you can rent bikes at the Hardware shop and cycle down the rail trail to Tanunda and then back up a gradual incline<br/>Christine"
38438917,758583797,2021-05-16,165183069,Ricardo,A wonderful cottage and stay. Everything we could have wished for provided by Alexandra. I would highly recommend.

We had delicious breakfast supplies (bacon, eggs, bread, milk, coffee etc) and the owner even thought to include treats and a toy for our puppy! Lovely fireplace (with plenty of firewood), heating, electric blankets... and walking distance to about 6 wineries, the brewery and the pub! Also a gorgeous gift shop across the road. This place is almost too good to let others know about."

40433618,585015940,2019-12-31,109406030,Julian,"Couldn't have been happier with the stay. It's a newly built, well finished space with brilliant views of the vineyard to wake up to each morning. Little touches like the freshly cut flowers from the garden, locally sourced ingredients for a breakfast (which were absolutely delicious!), made the stay! Comfortable queen bed, great aircon and close to all that Barossa has to offer. Will be back again in winter time!"

40433618,597595469,2020-01-26,24130762,Trent,"Vineyard Views is a great property with a lovely outlook in a central location, perfect for couples looking to spend a weekend exploring the Barossa. Karl is a responsive host, and the space is clean, modern and well equipped - we particularly enjoyed the kitchenette and local produce for brekkie! A small thing worth noting is that property is located in a shed in the backyard of the main house, with a small privacy screen seperating the two spaces. This wasn't a major deal, but did make the deck feel less selculded. Overall, we had a great time at Vineyard Views and would recommend Karl's place to anyone visiting the Barossa."
40433618,603950926,2020-02-09,229655873,Madison,"Had a lovely weekend stay at Vineyard views. Close to all the Barossa valley vineyards, had everything you needed and beautiful views. Thanks Karl!"

Having been to the Barossa a few times previously, staying at Karl’s place has made this time the most special. <br/>The apartment is awesome, super clean and comfortable and incredible views of the surrounding vines - especially at sunset. <br/>Karl was really friendly and welcoming (as were Jazzy and Ginger) - he even bailed us out when we arrived too late to get food anywhere. <br/>We really, really didn’t want to check out. 100% recommend."

Everything from the styling to the surprise breakfast goodies were a hit - and the incredible views go without saying. The location is also great - we stayed in for dinner to be able to enjoy it all but we easily would have been able to get outselves around to local eateries. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for accommodation in the Barossa and hope to go back ourselves.

Hentley Farm Wines, Hayes Family Wines, Henschke, ... In the evening we enjoyed the most beautiful sunset on the terrace and we discovered many kangaroos next to our accommodation. We had a delicious breakfast from Karl in the fridge. Homemade honey, bread, bacon, eggs, tomatoes and butter. We love it and we will come back! Thank you so much Karl!"
40433618,615398685,2020-03-08,11351782,Michael,Karl is a fantastic host and the place is a perfect little getaway in the heart of wine country. Everything you need is there and it’s sparkling clean.

Amazing property overlooking the valley, the host was very easy to communicate with, and the breakfast board was with local and farm fresh goods was a really nice touch. Perfect for a little getaway for two to the Barossa."
40433618,723795292,2021-01-12,119261882,Simone,"Karl and Nat are incredible hosts  - they want to ensure that you have the most enjoyable stay possible. I would describe them as the epitome of true South Australian warmth and hospitality. <br/><br/>“Vineyard Views” is the most spectacular Barossa Valley AirBNB. It felt like a dream come true to stay in a place where I could enjoy an al fresco dinning space and overlook the vineyards. Get your camera ready for those exquisite sunsets. <br/><br/>I adored the layout inside as well. It is incredibly spacious and comfortable. I loved the stylish colour schemes that added to a wonderful experience. <br/><br/>The location is perfect as you are only a short drive to several wineries, the Mengler’s Hill Sculpture and Barossa Adventure Parks. <br/><br/>Thank you so much for ensuring that I had a brilliant first time in the Barossa."
40433618,725118588,2021-01-17,5885498,Elise,"Karl and Nat’s place is amazing, great view with everything you need. Beautiful breakfast with local produce and coffee machine. Communication was super easy and quick. <br/><br/>Location is perfect, close many great wineries and restaurants. <br/><br/>Their hospitality was above and beyond, highly recommend and would definitely stay again :)"
40433618,727097594,2021-01-27,160932593,Jessie,"A great little spot to stay while we toured the Barossa. Just a short drive from the town and from many great wineries! The space was beautiful, and the little breakfast bits and pieces we discovered on our arrival that Karl had left for us was a really nice touch. We would happily stay again."
40433618,727818714,2021-01-31,6785248,Sijka,We absolutely loved our stay at vineyard views. The self contained accommodation was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay... Including delicious local goods for our breakfasts! The view from the deck was beautiful and we were really able to relax and feel like we were on holidays. Karl and Natalie were excellent hosts and we would recommend their place to anyone visiting the barossa.
40433618,730272943,2021-02-10,378931367,Hayden,"Highly recommend this beautiful vineyard stay with amazing views sunrise to sunset and amazing hospitality as well not to mention being so closes to majority of vineyards only a 5-10 minutes drive , we would definitely stay again and recommend everyone to try the experience."
40433618,730658055,2021-02-12,162399996,Clarrie,Accommodating hosts and an incredible space and view. I would highly recommend to anyone!
40433618,733812989,2021-02-23,169645195,Caitlin,"Newly renovated barn, stylish decor, immaculately clean with absolutely everything you’d need. Stunning views from the deck of the vineyard and rolling hills. Lovely hospitality with fresh eggs, bacon etc for breaky! Could not recommend more!"
40433618,734942456,2021-02-27,270263115,Luke,"Thanks Karl, my parents loved their weekend away!"
40433618,736357584,2021-03-05,13468274,James,"The perfect location for vine-side ambience, 10mins from the centre of Tanunda. Our evening spent on the deck overlooking the valley was a highlight of our trip. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

40433618,738007562,2021-03-10,97306248,Ashley,"Where do I even start on how amazing this spot is. <br/><br/>We came to the Barossa for our Honeymoon, as we arrived we were greeted by Karl for a quick gday. It was great to know who he was and where we were staying. Karl was great on the text and communication with us and happy for a call or text anytime. <br/><br/>The actual room itself was 10/10 with all the little comforts you want. <br/>To start with the photos are spot on, walking out from your lounge area you are directly on the deck very close to Karl’s vineyard. Awesome to have a bottle of wine at the end of the day right on a real working vineyard. <br/><br/>The whole room is brand new, high ceilings. We however loved the little things like;<br/>- free wifi<br/>- Apple TV with the ability to sign into Netflix <br/>- real, big towels and bath mat for the shower <br/>- really good strong shower with hot water <br/>- powerpoints right beside the bed for Charing phones etc. <br/><br/>Karls hospitality was sensational. He answered any questions we had and really went above in beyond with us which we can’t thank him enough for. <br/><br/>We were left in peace the whole time did not see any of Karl or his family unless we wanted to. <br/><br/>All the taxi’s we got to and from town knew the address from previous guests and we didn’t have to explain where to go or how to get there. <br/><br/>This is like a classic Air BnB experience but revamped to the 21st century. <br/><br/>You will not find another place like this for the price."
40433618,741384734,2021-03-22,383213319,Alexis,We will be back for sure. it was absolutely amazing

40433618,745845667,2021-04-05,8169379,Sophie,"Vineyard views was just magical. Looking over the 180 degree views of the vineyard from the deck over a glass of wine was very special indeed. The place was sparkling clean, stylish and spacious and exceeded all expectations. Karl and his family were lovely and hospitable (we even received some treats from the Easter bunny) and the fresh local produce for breakfast was divine. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a picturesque, private stay just out of town."
40433618,748783286,2021-04-14,1328941,Sarah,"Highly recommend!!! A very comfortable, cozy little place to stay close everything you need! Thanks Karl, we’ll be back!!"

Amazing views of the vineyards and great sitting areas outside. Location was great - very central most the of the wineries are 5 - 10 minutes on either side (drive) . I loved the little details - such as different colored towels/shower cap,    kitchen is well stocked in terms of equipment etc and breakfast was local and amazing.  I will surely stay here again when I come back to the Barossa! And will miss Ginger the cat who used to drop by here and there :-)"

40433618,761882340,2021-05-24,78232701,Maybron,"Though the flat is located at the back of the family house - because of the size of the property it feels  completely private. We loved the deck area, lovely viewing spot for the sunset, star gazing, or just to listen to the country quietness. A unique spot located in a vineyard and very central to Barossa attractions."

The set up is exactly as pictured and offers travellers a beautifully authentic experience in the Barossa. We enjoyed wines on the deck watching the sunset over the vibes every day. Incredible! Also appreciated the thoughtful touches like fresh bread, eggs, bacon and local honey. Would love to stay again and will recommend highly!"
40433618,768467368,2021-06-09,198578838,Amy,"A great place to stay in the Barossa and close to everything. It is very spacious, clean and has a beautiful view of vineyards.

40433618,439407485215823894,2021-08-29,6921399,Trudi,Loved our 2 night stay at Karl's place.  Such a quiet peaceful spot and the views are just gorgeous.  Located just outside Angaston on the rise of Menglers Hill we were treated with amazing vistas on our drives to and from the property and from our verandah space.  Vineyard views surrounded us with happy sheep being the only sounds heard. <br/><br/>Comfy well thought out accommodation space with everything we needed.  We didnt cook for ourselves but treated ourselves to supporting local cafes and restaurants.  Can highly recommend a meal at Casa Carboni and the cakes and breads at El Estanco in Greenock are stunning!

40433618,498812909344283577,2021-11-19,70838010,Michelle,"Great spot with lovely views across vineyards and down towards Angaston.  Afternoon sun cuts across the vineyards and onto the surrounding paddocks and is so beautiful. A very rural vista. Accm is lovely and new, plus was super clean. Bathroom is spacious and shower was lovely. Hosts provided beautiful local breakfast provisions and there is a Nespresso (no microwave). We had some variable weather (warm and cold) but the accm was really well insulated and the temp stayed perfect.  Wireless and AppleTv worked great. We enjoyed some cuddles out on the deck with Ginger the cat (she is not allowed in the accm). She seems to love coming to greet all the guests! Karl was a great host and good with communication. We also highly recommend Casa Carboni in Angaston. Fabulous food and super friendly hosts/chef."

Nothing is more than a 10-15 min drive & cabs come right up to the accommodation, they know it’s there. The brekky condiments included gave us meals both mornings which was a great personal touch. Very clean and has everything you need. You’re stay is set in the vineyards so it makes for a lovely view when you’re out on the deck enjoying the sun. Ginger the cat loves the attention!!   Overall super stay and would go back."

41405916,665924037,2020-09-20,53641658,Nicole,I would highly recommend staying at Triple Creek Wines! The views were stunning and the house was spacious and comfortable! Perfect for a group trip of four couples! Ben is fantastic!
41405916,673089322,2020-10-11,99949168,Paula,Great place. Beautiful home.
41405916,673692559,2020-10-12,370242467,David,"Very spacious, great views, modern amenities and well equipped"
41405916,702627377,2020-10-21,59793153,Danica,"We were blown away by this place. It was even better than we had hoped. The house is very spacious. Wonderful for a family getaway. And the view of the surrounding hills is quite a sight to wake up to. I loved that it was peaceful as there are no close neighbours. However, you are only a short drive from the main strip in Tanunda. Very handy for dashing in and out of town. Would highly recommend and we hope to visit again."
41405916,705570730,2020-10-31,22751236,Brendan,The house is nice but a bit tired. The house was full of millipedes mostly outside but a significant amount inside as well. Both toilets were blocked by the time we left. The house location is nice but on a long dirt track so a bit bumpy. The blinds in the rooms are not block out and we could see the blue sky through them so expect to wake up whenever the sun comes up. Overall it's a nice place and very big but for the price we paid I don't think it was great value for money.
41405916,707285271,2020-11-08,77240016,Biancah,Beautiful location
41405916,707739622,2020-11-08,24248986,Deb,Lovely location in amongst the vineyard.

41405916,712554605,2020-11-30,119706482,Elisabeth,"Triple Creek is well located for a time in the Barossa if you want to spend more time out of the house than in. It's spacious and the beds are comfortable and the linen fresh. There was however a very unpleasant smell of plastic / vinyl which needed to be expelled from the house every time we went in. This unfortunately brought many of the bugs in - and there were a lot! Provision  of little things, like insect repellent, coffee, sugar, normal tea bags (only green or earl grey was provided), more than one tea towel, cling wrap, a vegetable peeler, or sieve would have made it a little more comfortable. The outside area was not really pleasant or user friendly with the verandas being quite narrow. A little too expensive for what we thought it was / provided."
41405916,714626073,2020-12-11,15478574,Alana,"Great place, super spacious, lovely grounds!"
41405916,716375016,2020-12-19,9762144,Andrew,"Loved this place, such a unique experience staying on your own vineyard in the heart of the Barossa. The house is large, modern and well fitted out but the real star is the location among the vineyards"
41405916,716631756,2020-12-19,251010647,Vishwaka,The place was in an ideal location. Within close proximity to all the other wine cellar locations. The house was supper comfy with all things included. Great place
41405916,718164721,2020-12-25,65761918,Ashley,"Amazing getaway! <br/>If you want to escape the city life, this is definitely the place to do it"
41405916,719917897,2020-12-30,34630040,Louise,Loved staying amongst the vineyards.  Great central location to explore the Barossa Valley.
41405916,721229884,2021-01-02,34945837,Steph,"We loved our time at Ben’s place! He was a great communicator from booking to check in. <br/><br/>The house was great, so much room for our group of 6 adults & 4 kids. <br/><br/>We would definitely book again & recommend to others"
41405916,722661879,2021-01-07,202876558,Victoria,This place was so wonderful. Being in the middle of the vineyard and away from other buildings was sp refreshing. Wish we could have stayed longer.
41405916,735549127,2021-02-28,385316937,Phillip,Huge space - great for groups!

41405916,746940948,2021-04-08,371369683,Reece,"Exceptionally large house set on a beautiful vineyard. We couldn't believe it was all for us when we arrived! Fairly modern, very comfortable beds and a great kitchen, bbq and living spaces! This was the perfect base for our group trip to the Barossa and close to most major vineyards and local towns. We would return!! Thank you."
41405916,747591155,2021-04-11,301596292,Kyrlie,We had a great couples weekend away whilst in the area for a wedding. Great location just outside of tanunda! Nice peaceful and private location with plenty of room. <br/>Only thing we’d change would be adding some blockout curtain or blinds. The morning sun was a little unwelcome so early in the morning.
41405916,748604142,2021-04-14,75369776,Ilya,"We had a great time at Triple Creek guest house. The house was huge and had everything we needed. Able to stay in the working vineyard in the heart of Barossa region was unique experience, which we enjoyed greatly."
41405916,749628948,2021-04-18,38271602,Annabel,Great secluded property in the middle of a vineyard. Waking up to the sound of birds every morning was a delight.<br/><br/>Ben and his team are very helpful and respond quickly to communication.<br/><br/>4 separate bedrooms plus large living spaces make it a good house for a large family or a house party.
41405916,750889607,2021-04-22,207436085,Jarod,"This place is huge! We easily fit a group of 4 adults and 3 kids and had plenty of space for everyone. The fire pit and tree swing were huge hits with the kids! The beds were comfortable, but you may like to bring a spare blanket or two with you if you’re a cold sleeper as we couldn’t find one anywhere.<br/>The kitchen has plenty of space for several people to be in there at once, but if you plan on using it to cook proper meals then make sure you bring any utensils or specific items you need with you (eg. Serving spoon, wooden spoon, grater, strainer, salad bowl, baking paper, glad wrap) as these aren’t provided.<br/>The location is perfect - quiet and secluded, yet only 5 mins to Tanunda or Nuriootpa. Watching the changing light across the hills at sunrise and sunset was lovely.<br/>Dorham was very quick replying to messages and we really enjoyed our stay at his place."
41405916,754528296,2021-05-03,105148540,Charles,"A big home in a stunning setting. Cooking facilities made our stay particularly easy, communication was swift and the facilities were great. Made for a perfect weekend for our group"

41405916,763964192,2021-05-30,111889746,Hajung,"It is a beautiful home! It is a huge house with lots of space for a big group of people. Each bedroom was very spacious (especially the main bedroom with an en-suite!) and the beds were very comfortable. The house had a good heating system to keep you warm in cold days in Barossa. <br/><br/>Just a few other facts to prepare your stay!<br/>It uses rain water tank( like lots of farms houses do) and the tab water had a bit of colour. I’m sure it is safe to drink but ensure to bring bottled water if you don’t feel comfortable.<br/>The kitchen has a very limited supplies so if you are planning a family or group of people staying, you will have to come prepared (like coffee, milk etc). Not many cooking tools like pots, pans and utensils are available either.<br/><br/>The house was in the beautiful setting of vineyards and totally private, and we all enjoyed our stay here!!"
41405916,765238485,2021-06-01,312181055,Robyn,"Triple Creek Guest House is an amazing place, surrounded by vineyards and in the middle of nowhere but close to Barossa towns. It is so quiet but has top quality fittings. A great place to stay for 3-4 couples."
41405916,770318347,2021-06-14,21372578,Nick,Great location for easy access to the beautiful Barossa valley. Property is great for families to spread out<br/>And enjoy themselves. Would recommend!

When you walk in the front doors the house size shocks you, looks can definitely be deceiving. <br/><br/>The location was spectacular absolutely breath taking, lots to see and very peaceful. <br/><br/>I came here with my bridal party the night before my wedding, the place was just perfect, large enough to fit a football team and beautiful enough to take amazing photos. <br/><br/>They have all the utensils needed for cooking, bathrooms were very clean, beds super comfy, everything was just perfect. <br/><br/>Communication was a dream."

A wide variety of birdlike & wildlife - rabbits, kangaroos, blue wrens, honeyeaters etc. Also, if you want a modern home with lots of space and WiFi etc then this place is awesome.<br/>My young adult children (18-22) and parents (70's)  all enjoyed the time spent here. <br/><br/>Hosts were responsive and genuinely interested in our enjoyment of their place.<br/>Thanks."

Dorham was very quick in responding when questions were asked and the addition of wines to be purchased as well as a complimentary bottle and after dinner mints was the icing on this luxurious escape! Thanks guys 🥰

With two large bedroooms, two lovely bathrooms (not ensuite), a full laundry, an excellent kitchen and  a large living area with a wood burning fire it is one of the best equipped short term stay houses I have seen anywhere in the world. <br/>Whilst you do need to drive into Tanunda the setting is peaceful and the location is very central for the many vineyards in the Barossa. I highly recommend this property"

Loved everything about it...the 3 king beds with quality linen, gorgeous ensuites in each bedroom, master chef kitchen, heated flooring for the chilly mornings, great outdoor space for the 9 and 2 year old to play, minute walk to the Tanunda shops which was perfect for all and so so much more.

His hospitality was perfect and the little touches throughout only added to the comfort of our stay. The location is far enough off the beaten track that you think you feel you’ve escaped to a quieter, slower part of the world while being close enough to Tanunda and all the major wineries and restaurants. However nearby are a heap of great wineries within stumbling distance and a sensational  little bakery. You won’t go wrong staying here"

As soon as we walked in (it was freezing over the weekend we were there) we immediately felt warm and cosy. The addition of breakfast staples and coffee pod machine made it even better.

The fireplace kept the place cosy and warm, while the heated tiles and spa bath in the bathroom only added to how comforting it was!

A few small issues marred the stay a little, the fireplace wasn't working properly and kept switching itself off, some of the cooking utensils were dirty, the TV also had some connection issues, the bath was fantastic though some of the jets shot out of their sockets during our bath. Most of these issues would be easily overlooked but when they all stacked up it was a little disappointing, maybe it was just an off night"

The bedroom was adequate, comfy bed ( PS- IF it gets cold there's a blacker in the cupboard 😉 ) Great lights and well thought out simple yet effective decor.<br/>Bathroom is absolutely amazing, for a rustic shed they certainly did not skimp, I mean heated floor!? WOW maybe not needed in summer but nice for winter. Bath is large enough for two and the other amenities are great!<br/><br/>Kitchen is great! Plenty there to chef up a great meal! All the basic essentials pots, pans, plates utensils.<br/><br/>Fireplace is so relaxing! <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay.<br/><br/>Good spot if you like wineries, great food and small boutique shops.

42667491,540826726558947254,2022-01-15,20509527,Katie,The accomodation is in a lovely country setting yet still close enough to the town. Extremely comfortable with all the mod cons. We especially enjoyed sitting on the expansive deck and soaking in the fabulous spa bath. We hope to return again in the near future.
42667491,543015333784513236,2022-01-19,113197921,Lucas,"A very beautiful and well maintained property. We loved every minute of our stay and really enjoyed the privacy the property offers. It felt like we were on a far away farm away from it all, while only being a 5 minute walk to the town centre packed with beautiful cafes and amenities. I would highly recommend this place to any couple that wants to explore the Barossa region, we loved our stay :)"
42718676,659275326,2020-09-01,112355345,Georgia,Beautiful spot close to Angaston town with spectacular views from the balcony. A real retreat. <br/>Wish we had time to stay longer. <br/>And the hosts were very accommodating!

42718676,702432757,2020-10-20,66114366,Kate (Kathy),Highly recommended.  We loved our stay here in every way.
42718676,705580007,2020-11-01,151476309,Paula,"The auction yard was really nice. If staying with another couple need to realise that there is no wall from floor to ceiling for the bedrooms so you can talk to eachother and hear everything, ie talking snoring ect . It was a very unique place to stay.  Be careful with the highly polished bathroom tiles, our friends commented on how slippery they are and about 1hr later my partner fell over on the wet tiles.  We stayed for 3 nights and ate lunch and dinner at the location however had to buy dishwasher tablets as there were only one for each night which wasnt enough given the time we spent there. We booked thru Airnbnb however should have booked thru Jasmines own web page as for the same time Airbnb was $250 dollars more expensive. jasmine tried to help us out with resolving that problem and went out of her way but we couldn.t cancel and rebook thru her. Big difference in price."
42718676,706809958,2020-11-05,29149017,Jenny,A spacious delightful open spaced 2 bedroom house. Very clean with comfortable beds and large en-suite. It is in walking distance to Angaston and very close to the start of the Angaston to Nuriootpa cycle path. Highly recommend this Airbnb

42718676,743917272,2021-03-31,56659200,Sharon,"The Auction Shed is a beautiful property - you feel like you are in the country but still within an easy walk of the town.  It is worth noting that the bedrooms (which are lovely) do not have to the ceiling walls so noise does travel, however, sitting on the deck of a night looking out at the view more than makes up for this.  We would definitely stay again."
42718676,744804080,2021-04-02,72654362,Jonathan,Lovely property in a great location right near Angaston town centre. Close to all the sights of the Barossa and a very thoughtfully designed property with great facilities for two couples. Highly recommended!
42718676,745860661,2021-04-05,6404035,Michael,"Jasmine's Auction Shed was amazingly authentic. If you ever wanted to stay at an unique and interesting accommodation, this is definitely the place for you. It is equipped with reciting you need and more! The place was very clean, but there were some bugs around which could not be helped in such an accommodation. The 2 bathrooms (and spas!) are very modern and are spotless!  Would recommend for a unique stay!"

It felt like you were much further out of town than you actually were - in the middle of a paddock but just a 5 minute walk to excellent coffee.<br/><br/>Loved the outdoor shower - we were lucky enough to have singing magpies overhead. <br/><br/>Would definitively recommend it.
42718676,484955407014266568,2021-10-30,164154928,Melissa,"Lovely stay! Gorgeous area! Plenty to see and do. Or just stay and relax on the amazing deck out back. Highly recommend the Barossa sculpture park, and so many wonderful Cellar Doors to visit."

Great for a family of four or two couples but near in mind there aren’t internal ceilings in the bedrooms so you might hear your snoring housemate lol. Would definitely stay again."
42718676,535716195709582616,2022-01-08,29013693,Simon,Incredible stay. Great location and very well done renno. Our two kids were very excited to be staying in an old shed and they loved the spa bath and the Alpaccas.<br/><br/>The Nuri-Angaston bikeway being so close was excellent as well.

43047801,636635109,2020-07-10,153071297,Kirsty,We had a wonderful stay at Mel's house. She was easy to communicate with and she went out of her way to accommodate us. We appreciated all the special touches especially the banana cake she left us in the fridge. Thanks so much Mel I'm sure we will be back to stay with family or friends 🙂
43047801,637631873,2020-07-13,152771325,Sarah,"Melissa's place was absolutely spotless, stylish and cosy. We stayed 2 nights with our two year old and felt right at home straight away but still got to experience those little touches of holiday luxury. The cottage is a ten-minute walk to the really pretty main street with heaps of cafes and amenities, including two beautiful playgrounds. Melissa was a dream to communicate with. I would highly recommend a stay at this perfect spot."
43047801,639674509,2020-07-19,351903691,Mikaela,"Melissa's cottage was the perfect backdrop for our girl's weekend away in the Barossa Valley. The cottage itself is gorgeously styled, fully stocked with everything we needed (and more!), and the extra touches were so thoughtful. Melissa's local recommendations were excellent and even though weren't able to experience them all, we can't wait to come back again to finish the list! We can't rave enough about how smooth and easy communicating with Melissa was, the location of the cottage and and how the host had thought of absolutely everything - we were so impressed and can't wait to come back!!"
43047801,642450172,2020-07-26,356469957,Lucy,"Mel is prompt in answering questions and has truly gone above and beyond to create a calm, relaxing and beautiful space. The backyard is picturesque and the amenities are second to none.<br/>It’s perfect for a girls weekend away or if you’re a couple looking for a romantic get away in the Barossa.<br/>Angaston and the Main Street has lots to offer and delicious food and coffee.<br/>It was all the personal touches that Melissa had that truly made us feel special and made our stay extra amazing.<br/>Couldn’t recommend highly enough and we will most definitely be back."

It is beautifully furnished, with lots of thoughtful touches (including my favourite candle!), it is amazingly clean, has comfortable bedding and the most gorgeous outlook - we enjoyed a few cold glasses of wine admiring the view whilst our girls happily played the provided lawn games.  Everything is on your doorstep. Holiday bliss!  Mel is simply a wonderful host. 10/10 from us, thanks again!"

43047801,701333612,2020-10-18,326621732,Joanna,Melissa’s place was fabulous. It is in a great location...you can walk into town and is only a short drive to many local wineries and other towns. Everything you need for an enjoyable comfortable stay is there. Melissa has local knowledge of the area and provides many little extras that made our stay wonderful.
43047801,703436487,2020-10-24,4759745,Kelli,"Mel’s place is amazing!! Such a lovely house in a great location. Mel was very quick with communication, and left a great selection of information about Angaston and the Barossa. I highly recommend you stay here!"
43047801,705591655,2020-11-01,25181424,Jess,"Thinking about staying here? DO IT! <br/>We were so impressed with the communication - especially given I am a bit crappy with communication, missing emails and texts (I'm the person who never knows where my phone is!). <br/>Mel even made sure the heating was on for our arrival and there were so many lovely touches like local bread, treats and wine which just made my day on arrival. <br/>The facilities are top notch and Mel has though of all the little things. <br/>We would so happily come back next time we are in the Barossa - great value and great location!"
43047801,707294964,2020-11-08,87680914,Austin,The Perfect location from<br/>Which to enjoy a Barossa escape. Mel’s communication and quick communication was fantastic. Clean and stylish home with beautiful views and plenty of space to relax.

She was a fabulous host and we strongly recommend her place."
43047801,711380321,2020-11-25,21027588,Verity,"This cottage was immaculately presented and really comfortable. It was well-located with an easy walk up the main street  to the local cafes, shops, playgrounds and walking trails. Angaston is such a pretty town and close to other Barossa townships."
43047801,713583993,2020-12-05,6681952,Margaret,"If you're looking for a 'home away from home' while in the Barossa, Mel's place is IT! From the quality of fittings and stylish layout to the wonderful welcome pack and information on local Angaston and Barossa attractions and activities, Mel's place had it all. It is a gorgeously renovated cottage with sparkling new bathroom and laundry, quality kitchen fittings and very comfortable beds. Mel ensured it was spotlessly clean - including extra foil in the Smeg oven to catch any drips. The house was as depicted in the photos but with much more outdoor space to which photos just don't do justice.  Sitting in either of the covered outdoor areas with views across to the sheep and alpacas grazing on the hill while listening to the cockatoos and parrots in the creek-side gum trees made us feel as if we were a million miles away - but in fact, it was only a short walk up into the main part of Angaston where there is something for everyone. Being central to many wineries, taking a taxi was easy too. There were no 'downsides' to staying at Mel's place! Easy to find, great location, excellent communication - highly recommended."
43047801,717279771,2020-12-21,380249523,Thomas,"A lovely stay for a relaxing trip in the Barossa. The house is exceedingly comfortable and pretty, and Melissa was kind all the way through."
43047801,718548437,2020-12-26,166250351,Lucy,Absolutely awesome place to stay. The house is stunning and instantly put me in holiday mode. Felt like a home away from home and I really enjoyed being able to cook up a storm in the great kitchen. Would definitely recommend staying for a decent period of time to explore the area. Thanks Mel ☺️
43047801,722074967,2021-01-05,56796292,Melissa,"A wonderful stay to disconnect from city daily grind. Loved the kitchen facilities, kitchenware and extra touches in pantry; we cooked a lots of meals (due to allergies) during our stay and almost used everything at least once. Lovely new appliances with Miele dishwasher and Smeg stovetop/oven and mattresses were comfortable with some feather pillows. Mel was able to accommodate a late check out request which made us and the kids so happy. A short walk to playgrounds and shops which was amazing. Loved the space of the backyard and views of the hill with animals. Recommendations and tips by Mel in the book was very helpful and yes Kiel’s have SPECTACULAR coffee! Many thanks for your great communication and being a great host Mel. Hope to stay again in the near future."
43047801,722903129,2021-01-08,45694465,Megan,We really enjoyed our stay. The photos represented the place very well and the kitchen was particularly well outfitted. The property was very clean and well kept. Loved the outdoor area and view.
43047801,724705782,2021-01-16,378067471,Simon,"If you are looking for a property in Angaston - or the Barossa Valley in general - look no further. We have stayed in a number of Airbnb's around the Barossa and Mel's is the best we have found. Welcoming, clean, stylish, well stocked; it is pretty much everything you want in an Airbnb. Mel's communication was outstanding and she even left local wine and sourdough bread for our arrival. It is a 5 min walk to all the restaurants in Angaston and an easy drive everywhere else. Perfect for families or couples.<br/>Mel is the definition of a superhost!"
43047801,736870077,2021-03-06,14919880,Judith,"Mel's place was a wonderful place to stay at. The house was sparkling clean and extremely well appointed. We loved the outside area, which provided a fabulous playground for our 2 young children. The property is fully fenced so we didn't need to worry about our kids running out onto the street. Mel provided some little extras, that made us feel very special, including fresh bread, fruit, coffee, etc. The beds were super comfortable and we ended up sleeping better and for longer than we do at home ;).

43047801,738724393,2021-03-13,25048908,Melissa,"Beautiful place to stay in the Barossa. Melissa has thought of everything, and it’s an incredibly homely place to stay. Loved the bottle of wine and treats to help us settle in on arrival. Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend."
43047801,740458147,2021-03-19,26076536,Peter,"Situated at the edge of  Anguston, just a few minutes walk from the shopping, cafe precinct. Perfect stopover for the 5 of us for a couple of days. Mel was an outstanding host going beyond what is normally expected with her little homely touches. Would highly recommend!"
43047801,746710062,2021-04-07,74128565,Christopher,"We loved staying at Mel’s beautiful cottage on the edge of Angaston - the best Airbnb we have stayed in, hands down. Such a brilliant location, slap bang in the middle of the Barossa - right next to incredible cellar doors - and in a pretty town full of delightful cafes and equipped with the best playgrounds ever.<br/>The cottage was homely, cosy and immaculate - Mel had supplied everything you could have asked for (including lots of tasty treats). The beds were more than comfortable,  the shower was hot and powerful and the garden had lovely, rural views. It was quite hard to leave this gorgeous house. Thank you, Mel."
43047801,747592355,2021-04-11,391311515,Katherine,"Thanks for welcoming us into such a beautiful home. The care and dedication that you have put into this space was evident the moment we arrived. From the welcome message in your guide book to the delicious local produce, it was the perfect touch to a great weekend. We won’t hesitate to tell all our friends and family about this place."
43047801,750237240,2021-04-19,59435060,Ryan,"Wonderful, centrally located house perfect for a small group of friends or a family. <br/><br/>The host provided fantastic personal touches such as wine butter and cheese in the fridge. <br/>The kitchen and bathrooms were well equipped and the bedrooms had comfortable beds. <br/>Remote controlled outdoor blinds to block out light were another bonus. <br/><br/>There was also a binder of local suggestions and instructions."
43047801,751690647,2021-04-25,202335439,Wendy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Melissa House in Angaston. Walking distance to the town and playgrounds.  <br/><br/>The house was beautiful inside, great furnishings and very comfortable for our family stay.  The back garden is setup perfectly for entertaining and lots of outdoor games for kids/adults.<br/>It was very special to watch the neighbouring farmers sheep and lambs.  <br/><br/>Lots of personal touches like fresh bread, milk, chocolates, coffee and the list goes on. Melissa communicated with us from start to finish, assisting with any questions.  Thank you, Melissa.  Highly recommend this stay!"
43047801,754515984,2021-05-03,9454144,Theresa,"We had a wonderful 3 night stay at Mel’s beautiful house. We felt so welcome with beautiful touches and goodies left for us. Such a gorgeous town, great walk in to coffee and short drives to amazing wineries. Couldn’t be more perfect. Big thanks Mel!"

43047801,762937165,2021-05-27,10134029,Phillip,"Mel's house provided a cosy retreat against the cold, wet winter conditions raging outside.   We certainly appreciated the central gas heating that reached through out the house and the comfortable bed to snuggle into.   <br/>Angaston itself is quite central and an easy commute to other towns and wineries.  It's is a pity we didn't have time to take the Casa Carboni Italian cooking class in the main street, but we have to leave something for our next visit."
43047801,764581768,2021-05-31,13291043,Adrian,Mel was an excellent host ensuring the house was warm and welcoming upon arrival including local produce and a bottle of red wine. The location gave amazing views and quick and easy access to sights including Nuriootpa and Tanunda from the location on the edge of Angaston. An excellent family house with our young children happily exploring the backyard. Will definitely consider staying here again.
43047801,767591826,2021-06-06,27729900,Barbara,"Melissa's house is absolutely adorable. We were a group of 5 adults, 4 of who travelled from the Sunshine Coast, and to have a few goodies and bottle of red wine waiting for us upon arrival was an absolute delight. The location is great, short walk to a park and the bustling town of Angaston. Every morning we sat outside in the garden admiring the peaceful view. Thank you Melissa for a lovely stay!"
43047801,770320912,2021-06-14,38229073,Amara,Beautiful house. Convenient location. Mel was easy to communicate with and clearly puts a lot of thought into the house with lots of special touches
43047801,388588353706707864,2021-06-19,281957754,Margie,"Mel is a great host adding personal touches in her communication and our welcoming stay in the cottage. The cottage is cosy, very comfortable and has everything you could think of for a really pleasurable stay; lots of little extras. Great kitchen, wonderful shower, terrific outdoor facilities for warmer weather and plenty of space for kids to play if you're a family. And  every room very clean. Beds are very comfortable, linen excellent. 2nd toilet helpful. The cottage is in good location at the western end of the main street so easy walking distance to Angaston's shops and things of interest. Lovely outlook from the back up to the open gum studded hills with sheep to watch; lovely feel of country. Tree part way over the drive makes turning in interesting but space to turn your car in the back garden to come out facing front! We would certainly go back. Really enjoyed our stay there."

43047801,429187469293918426,2021-08-14,277035115,Peter,"Well I think this would have to be the cleanest and well provisioned AirBnB I have ever stayed in. The house was spotless and everything you could possibly need and or expect was there, brilliant, Mel you are indeed the hostess with the most-est. We cleaned up as best we could but we were running late so didn't get a chance to clean the floors, sorry about that.  I will definitely recommend Mels cottage to anyone who needs a great place to stay in the Barossa Valley."

43047801,439342712679784845,2021-08-29,76411084,Neville,"Melissa's house at Angaston is a unique treasure. With a wonderful eclectic taste in literature and music. The welcome basket including the bread, wine, biscuits, cheese, milk frutichocs. Not to mention the Vegemite and butter in the fridge were absolutely brilliant. Melissa had been there not long before we arrived and had turned the airconditioning on to ensure the house was toasty warm.  It is hosts like Melissa and houses like hers that she allows others to use that will ensure the longevity of organisations like Airbnb. Melissa is organised and committed to ensuring that her guests will have the ultimate travel/ holiday experience. Thank you Melissa. Everything was perfect. <br/>Kind Regards Neville."

We felt it was a little overpriced compared with other homestays/cabins we’ve stayed at. It costs $30 each way for a cab into town if you both aren’t driving.

43128151,761888305,2021-05-24,347206955,Lesley,Poor communication -was unable to contact hosts / new operators had failed to update phone numbers on the Airbnb website. Therefore we could not  contact them or access  the accommodation. Don't be fooled by the 'Super host' label as it refers to previous operators.  From the outside the cabins look no better than a shabby caravan park. Host is unwilling to negotiate any sort of refund. Very disappointing!

Its location strikes an ideal balance, with easy proximity to many iconic Barossa treasures and yet just removed enough from the town centres and arterial roads to ensure a serene and secluded escape. We’re also so grateful for the superb private Cirillo tasting with Marco — an absolute must for lovers of wine without the wank(!), it perfectly encapsulated the Cirillo experience: welcoming, generous, understated, deliberate, and the quality speaks for itself. Wholeheartedly recommend, and will certainly return! Huge thanks to Annika and Marco."

I was impressed with how perfectly quiet it was, even in the downstairs apartment, I couldn’t hear the neighbours at all. The kitchen is wonderful for cooking my Barossa goodies that I discovered. The spa was lovely to relax in at the end of the day with a glass of wine. Remember to bring some beautiful bath salts (Go to Coco- Marie for lovely natural bath salts and soaps)."
43366530,543703004155566967,2022-01-19,9058563,Matt,"A generally enjoyable stay however a few things were not upto scratch which prevented the stay being much better.<br/>On checking in to the room, we found an out of order please do not use sign on the spa bath. No prior notification was given which was a pity as we were looking forward to relaxing in the spa whilst on our break.<br/>The TV also had issues as it kept switching itself off intermittently so in the end we just gave up on it.<br/>And the listing states a washing machine available. However it is a pay for use machine in a common area laundry - would have expected better clarification of that in listing.<br/>Apartment was clean and comfortable enough. Check in/out was easy too. Unfortunately the problems somewhat soured the overall experience. Some sort of discount really should have been offered in my opinion."

It is even better than the photos, they have done an amazing job renovating.<br/>The space is so large and open too!<br/>The location is beautiful and serene, and only 20 minutes drive from Tanunda, and only 5 or 10 minutes from the start of the wineries. It is so conveniently close to Gawler too, so we were able to pop in and grab some bits and pieces and make the most of the kitchen. <br/>It was so kind to have the bacon and eggs available too, clearly fresh from the chooks on the property.<br/>Greg and Mary's hospitality was amazing, and Greg truly went out of his way to help us with some left behind items.<br/>We would happily return again!"

The little house is surprisingly really spacious and beautifully presented. The space is very thoughtfully designed and has everything you need, from a king size bed right up to a dishwasher and washing machine, to make it a fully self sufficient holiday. We even enjoyed the novelty of the composting toilet, which proved to have no smell unlike regular toilets. We loved sitting out on the verandah and watching the sunset and then the stars with a glass of wine. We also loved meeting Gina the dog, who we invited to come stay for a drink with us one night!<br/>All the main attractions of the Barossa and the Adelaide Hills were an easy drive away and the Williamstown town was about a 15-20min walk."

With everything to see, do and eat in the Valley we couldn’t help but take an opportunity to cook at home and take advantage of the beautiful kitchen. The property is styled beautifully, the basics are all provided and the beds are guaranteed for a sleep in. Wish we had a couple more days and some warm weather to enjoy the outdoor entertaining area and pool. Next time!"
45352792,703468787,2020-10-25,164691169,Jasmine,"Relaxing getaway for the whole family! My husband, mum and 3 year old son had a wonderful time at Budburst House. Rebecca's house is beautifully styled in all its furnishings, and immaculately clean. Such thoughtful touches throughout with fresh lavender and plants (I loved the potted olive tree in the dining area - I bought one at the Barossa nursery myself for home!). Great goodies provided, Barossa locally made bread and milk & breakfast essentials for breakfast! The outdoor area was gorgeous with a nice sized yard and beautifully clean pool, would love to come again in summer one time to use the pool. We did have a quick dip on the warmer day we were there and my son loved the floaty llama! Great for kids, puzzles, books, toys/blocks and a piano for them (and adults!) to play on. It is great as it has a bath too as well as seperate shower for families. Inside, the kitchen has absolutely everything you need and is very well designed with brand new appliances. Linen and bath towels were all very lush. Budburst House was a stylish home away from home, has everything you need as a family and close to all Tanunda shops. Thank you for being such a wonderful host Rebecca, we were very happy in choosing your lovely b&b for our getaway!!"

First time being in the Barossa & we absolutely loved staying at this house. Everything was thought of....from fresh bread/jams/butter for breakfast, fresh flowers around the house, to make up wipes in the bathroom! Rebecca has gone above and beyond to be an Air bNb host and it shows. We will definitely be visiting again!"
45352792,707274981,2020-11-07,9024522,Angela,"Absolute gem in the Barossa. Rebecca's house is not only modern, stylish and clean. The little touches she put in (e.g. a little welcome note with some snacks and breakfast prepared for us, though it might look small, we really appreciated it as it saves us time to head to supermarket). Everything used in the house is of quality too. We absolutely enjoyed our stay. Communication with Rebecca was easy and quick.  We cannot fault a thing from our stay. There are 5 star hotels, and the Budburst House is definitely a 5 star airbnb. Highly recommended!"

45352792,723168037,2021-01-10,381029415,Vanessa,"Budburst House is the the ultimate 'Home away from Home'. My partner and I had an amazing few days away and we really appreciated all the little extras Rebecca provided from the beautiful hand and body wash in the bathrooms, to the yummy local bread and creamy milk. We adored the quality bed linen, Sheridan towels and the most comfortable mattress ever! The kitchen had absolutely everything we needed to cook up a storm.. we loved the premium quality knives and cookware and the huge island bench!  The spacious, open plan living with gorgeous raked ceilings has such a great vibe. The undercover outdoor area complete with bbq is great, but the highlight is definitely the sparkling clean pool. It was just perfect and we spent a whole day relaxing and swimming. Budburst House is such a beautiful home.. we didn't want to leave and will definitely be back soon!"

Tucked away in a quiet little part of Tununda (Website hidden by Airbnb) it truly is the perfect accomodation located closely to some of the most incredible wineries & restaurants. We loved being so close to Fermentasian Restaurant, Hentley Farm Winery & Casa Carboni Restaurant & Cooking School. <br/>Only my husband & I stayed but the house could easily accommodate a small group. <br/>We are so happy we stayed at BudBurst with so much attention to detail, from Breakfast to 'Happy Hour' we felt very spoilt, lovely bedlinen & interior design from gorgeous artwork, cushions & furniture. <br/>We will be sure to return."

It is thoughtfully provisioned and equipped with just about everything you could need for a short stay. It would suit a young family on a summer holiday as there is a piano, a pool and a reserve right next door for frisbee or footy.  And, a very comfy king sized bed which is hard to find on AirBNB."

Well stocked with cleaning products etc. <br/>Great location only a short stroll to the Main Street, parks and playgrounds.<br/>It was the perfect size and layout for my husband, kids and myself, and my parents too. It didn’t feel like we were on top of each other as there are 2 living areas and bathrooms.<br/>We would like to return in warmer weather and utilise the pool!"
45352792,437905575017025036,2021-08-27,26403036,Lina,Rebecca’s house is a quiet refuge.  It has everything you need for a getaway for a family.  Next to a reserve at the end of a quiet cup-de-sac there is a reserve for the children to play and runaround. In summer there is the pool.  The house has two television areas and also games etc for children to play indoors.  The kitchen is well equipped if you choose to cook.  It was a pleasure to come back to the house and relax  after a day out in the Barossa Valley.

45352792,459643348692135320,2021-09-26,334682528,M,Rebecca was so wonderful and accommodating especially with proving for my 1 year old. The house is wonderful and was relaxing from the moment you walked in. We especially loved spending time in the back yard. It is well thought out and even the smallest details have been thought about like motion detecting night lights in the hallway to help unfamiliar people find their way at night. It is generously fitted out with supplies you need (Rebecca was even thoughtful enough to ask what sort of milk we would need. I can not recommend her any more. We may have to stay again in when it is warmer to enjoy the pool more as most of us where not brave enough to bear the pool in what seemed like winter weather.<br/><br/>Thanks again.

The very organised instruction folder for all the equipment in the house was much appreciated as well as the information booklet with recommendations for places to go and things to do.

We loved sitting around the large fire place, there was plenty of wood provided and the fireplace was ready for us to light when we arrived.    Lyndoch is a very pretty village with numerous wineries within a short distance.  The countryside is delightful especially in spring with all the leaves on the vines.

45772254,717280558,2020-12-21,1574572,Svetlana,"What an AMAZING place to stay in Barossa. With vines right outside the window, in a cosy hideaway right next to Tanunda - this place is perfect. So cosy, with touches of luxury, we loved the locally crafted breakfast hamper - honestly, the best supplies compared to the many, many airbnbs we stayed at. Loved the open plan and soaring wooden beams, such a nice feeling to come back to the cottage after a day of exploring. Double shower and a huge, comfy bed were a bonus. Charmaine was very responsive and so helpful with local recommendations - we had such a great time! If we’re back in Barossa, this is the only place we’ll be staying at - and will be recommending to everyone. It’s a gem."

Not only was there everything we could possibly need for breakfast but local cheese, chocolate and jams for us to enjoy. Loved the cottage and also the book showing how it was built. It had absolutely everything we needed. The view of the local vineyards made it feel like we were really amongst the wine region with locals. We loved our stay and will be back."

A panoramic window in the lounge area opens up the cottage to the views of the western acclivity of Trial Hill, which is a stunning sight at sunset.<br/><br/>Your hosts, Steve and Charmaine, are very welcoming, responsive and helpful with things to do whilst visiting the area. They also generously supply a superb array of local food produce in your complimentary breakfast hamper.<br/><br/>The Halletts Valley Hideaway is a stay which we highly recommend for couples wishing to enjoy a romantic week-long getaway to the Barossa Valley."

It is located barely 5 minutes walk from the town centre and within very close driving distance to so many wineries, breweries and distilleries. The photos do not do place justice. There is an amazing view from the backyard over Angaston which you can either enjoy in the backyard or from the comfort of the enclosed verandah.

47117855,419099163318448575,2021-08-01,7469261,Cee-Jon,Adele’s place was the perfect get-away for Barossa adventures. It was super cozy and loved the fireplace for the cooler winter nights. It’s fully setup with amenities including a fully featured kitchen and reliable hot water.<br/><br/>Our cavoodle Frankie also loved the backyard to roam and explore. Will definitely recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area and certainly will look this place up again in the future when we’re in town! Thanks again Adele!
47117855,459721551617688762,2021-09-26,24592494,Alice,"We had such a wonderful stay at Adele’s place!

47164084,737427477,2021-03-07,280607486,Marie,"This accommodation is so very perfect for a large family, so much so that we would like to stay there again sometime when international travel recommences and we can have ALL of our family together. <br/>There are 4 sitting areas and 2 dining areas inside, and spacious bedrooms, allowing for any amount of privacy for anybody who wanted it (children escaping from adults and vice-versa). When downstairs it's impossible to hear anybody upstairs, and even between rooms the sound-proofing is amazing.  One sitting area & the main dining room were large enough for everybody to congregate, and the kitchen was very well-equipped and large enough for many cooks to work together. <br/>The outside deck, sitting areas and barbecue spot overlooked the orchard and a vineyard, and we were encouraged to pick and eat as much fruit as we wanted, and also to help ourselves to any vegetables that were growing. The lawn areas were great for playing or relaxing on, and with no near neighbours, we could be as noisy as we wanted. <br/>The house has many doors and windows, allowing for flow-through fresh air, so whether we were inside or outdoors, we could always hear the birds chatting in the massive gum trees. <br/>I felt that the only possible improvement would be a swimming pool or tennis court. However it was all so perfect that we only went out for a few hours during the days, and at night nobody wanted to eat out; we all stayed home and cooked up our own banquets. We certainly appreciated the gift of some wines. <br/>This is a very homely, comfortable accommodation displaying history and character, and very perfect for families or groups of couples."
47164084,769469523,2021-06-13,404994497,Jamie,Incredible experience and such a perfect home to host large family gathering.  I would definitely stay here again.  <br/>Perfect!!
47164084,770313793,2021-06-14,406643480,Michelle,"The hosts were very friendly and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. The house was very clean and facilities were all good quality.  They provided basic cooking supplies, hand wash, shower gels, shampoo and conditioner etc.  they also supplied plenty of firewood and the complimentary wine was delicious. Plenty of space for multiple families. Would definitely recommend this house for a luxury getaway"

Located in a quiet part of the Barossa , this property is surrounded by vines, trees and the Jacobs creek. Wildlife in abundance in the local area with kangaroos and plentiful bird life observed on our frequent walks. Near the Mawson trail if you wish to walk/run/ride some great trails. (I ran to the Steingarten lookout). Taxi picked us up for dinners out. Comfortable beds, great deck to watch the birds.  Loved the house and the location. We will look to return next year."

47322117,408979699568145487,2021-07-18,98844052,Nicola,"Stayed three nights on cold and wet weekend in July, family of four, plus dog. <br/>Huge house with big and well equipped kitchen, only missing a toaster, but easy to use grill. <br/>Bedrooms lovely with comfortable beds and fresh linens. Nice views from main bedroom. <br/>Games room with pool table was a brilliant edition and many games were played over our stay. <br/>Ducted heating doesn’t work well, but wood burning stove brilliant and four electric radiators kept us warm. <br/>Check in and out super easy. <br/>Had a plumbing issue during our stay which meant we couldn’t use the spa (had planned on using a lot) but these things happen and sincere apologies given and two bottles of wine quickly delivered. <br/>Would be great place for a couple of families or large group of friends to stay, although if more than 4 people staying would need more sofas, as only a small L shaped lounge just seating 4. Dining table seats 8. <br/>Ok location. 10 mins to Tanunda and Lyndoch. Quiet even though on main road. Outdoor area lovely with lots of different areas to sit, great gazebo with Lounges and table overlooking vines, never got to use unfortunately as cold and wet. Would be fab in spring/autumn."

47478352,764571417,2021-05-31,394807712,Natalie,"Teresa Garden Holiday Home is set in amongst the vineyards and about half a km back from the road. It's a lovely location - very tranquil, private and beautiful views from the windows. It's also very close to the main centre of Tanunda, which is helpful.<br/><br/>The house itself is large, which is lovely. There is a dining room, 2 separate living areas and 4 good-sized bedrooms. The beds are very comfortable and warm with lots of blankets and pillows, which was important because it was cold when we were there. There are also a number of heaters throughout the house. The house was also very clean and well-appointed - it had everything you need, including board games which we had a great time playing around the dining table.<br/><br/>The hosts were very responsive and helpful. Shortly before we travelled to the accommodation the hosts advised me that there had been some recent electrical work and to let them know if we had any trouble. We noticed that there were some power outlets that didn't work and I've advised them since returning from our holiday.  <br/><br/>Thanks so much to the lovely hosts - the home is beautiful and it was a lovely setting. I would recommend and would stay again."

The tranquility and seclusion is actually something we really valued. The garden has many beautiful spots to enjoy but the interior was the real draw card for us. Beautifully furnished rooms and two well appointed bathrooms made this perfect for a girls weekend away.  With four living spaces, we didn’t even use the sitting room. Such great value for money - We will be back!"

The check in process was very smooth & easy, there is Lovely views from all parts of the house but unfortunately it was very dirty, dirty dishes on the sink & in the dishwasher, the bathrooms weren’t clean, new towels had been chucked on the basins with the tags still on which didn’t give everyone a towel each, the outdoor furniture was everywhere & covered in dirt & leaves, the inside rubbish bin was full & the beds didn’t appear to have had the bedding changed. This is just a few things.<br/>Unfortunately as we discovered these things we all became very disappointment & wish we hadn’t booked the accommodation.<br/>When we contacted the owners about the towels they advised us the cleaner forgot so they arranged new towels & could we use the hand towels to make do.<br/>We wouldn’t recommend this accommodation at all."

We especially enjoyed our surprise visit from one of the farm dogs, Rocket. Would recommend for anyone wanting a peaceful and relaxing time in the country."

The fire place with its combustion wood fire added a delightful ambience and warmth to the living area. The breakfast supplies, bottle of bubbles and chocolates were a nice touch. <br/>The front garden is a treat, with interesting touches of nostalgia in its rusty iron work gates, original stone walls and little nooks.

Good pub a few doors up the road but you need a car if you want other dining options. Not too far from towns for provisions etc so stock up! Or visit the weekend farmers market - which was great! <br/>Appreciated the complementary breakfast provisions and welcome bottle of wine! <br/>A few minor suggestions made directly to host - but no show stoppers! <br/>Highly recommended for those looking for a quite and well appointed property

Four rooms provide all you need with good breakfast and bathroom provisions.  Fireplace a bit small for woodcuts but nice to counter cold of Eden Valley.  if you arrive at night and can't see cottage, go up driveway 26A.  Mike responds promptly to Q's and local Kaz fixes stuff in a way I hope owners value."

48367802,439342956469787462,2021-08-29,24127727,Sarah,Beautiful little cottage surrounded by lavender bushes. Great backyard for a dog. Lovely touches in having bread and toiletries available.<br/>We were disappointed with some cleanliness issues (we had to clean up broken glass) and also the fact that the wood supplied was not suited to the fireplace (which has been mentioned by other guests).

48367802,455335676819720664,2021-09-20,158642218,Rowan,"A lovely cottage full of old world charm amidst the tranquility of a small farming village all about an hour from Adelaide. The 21st Century doesn’t seem quite so important in a 150 year old building and conversation, rather than clicking keyboards, flourishes. <br/><br/>A coffee in the morning admiring the beautiful feont garden and a glass of something more adult in the afternoon among the rear gardens Lavender. <br/><br/>A quick walk up to the pub for dinner and an award winning wine list to boot!<br/><br/>Mike’s place is the perfect spot to unwind and recharge."

Nice assortment of amenities supplied, and we were comfortable throughout our stay. Mike is prompt and considerate in his communication.<br/><br/>We found broken glass, and evidence of previous guests not picking up after their pets, so worth a checking if you use the yard."

48367802,531376106173929579,2022-01-02,7276422,Hannah,"We stayed at Mike’s place for 4 nights while we explored the Barossa region. The house is located in Eden Valley which is a small town about 20 mins away from the main Barossa towns and wineries. Eden Valley has a general store and an excellent pub, but not much else so you will need to arrange transport or drive to wineries further afield. The house is absolutely lovely, really well equipped and perfect for a couple. Although it was 40 degrees outside the air con kept us cool and we had a great time doing jigsaw puzzles and cooking up a storm in the kitchen! Would definitely stay here again when we are next in the area."

Nice and close to the main street for convenience but not so close it was noisy or there was a lot of traffic/foot traffic.<br/><br/>We did understand the description to mean that there would be an oven (that could just be us and we love to cook together when we are away), not in any way a big issue, we were still able to cook together on the gas stove, but just a heads up. <br/><br/>Would absolutely go back there.  Check-in and out were also very easy and we knew exactly what to expect because Mary was great at communicating with us."

Would highly recommend.
48999138,758625071,2021-05-16,27391736,Annemaree,"All aboard! We LOVED our recent stay at The Station.<br/><br/>Our group of seven (5 adults & 2 children) enjoyed a 2 night stay in May, and we wish our stay was longer!<br/><br/>From the start, our communication with Bridget (host) was great, and her warm welcome was informative and helpful. Bridget had thought of everything for our stay. From marshmallows to toast on the fire-pit, to delicious local essentials for breakfast. <br/><br/>The old Kapunda railway station is huge and has been lovingly and stylishly restored. There were plenty of living spaces, both indoor and outdoor, and we almost lost count of the bedrooms. Although the property is large, it is very cosy and was perfect for our weekend away. The bedrooms were toasty warm and are decorated in a stylish, minimalist manner. There were thoughtful touches like complimentary eyemasks and an ‘Alexa’ in each room. The games room was fun and the kids also enjoyed the wooden train set that was supplied. Other little touches like plenty of throw rugs, spare toiletries and a big bowl of fresh fruit made us just want to stay in all weekend! At the host’s recommendation, we also ordered a brunch box and a DIY pizza pack which was delivered to the door by local providore, Coopers Fresh.<br/><br/>When we did get out and about, we enjoyed walks around the town, some retail therapy in the local shops and a visit to the nearby playground. Pubs and the supermarket are also within walking distance.<br/><br/>We’d highly recommend The Station for a few days away. It’s great for families and groups and we’re already thinking about another visit! Toot Toot!"

48999138,401670476020564109,2021-07-08,292824326,Casper,"Fantastic place that offers something else - the atmosphere of being in an old railway station is special. The place has a nice design and special touches that makes it warm and welcoming. We had tree lovely nights, among others enjoying a big bonfire in the courtyard while looking at the stars. The kids had a blast exploring both inside and outside - it is not everyday you say yes to them playing on railway tracks."

To be in such a historic and beautiful building, coupled with Bridget’s incredible restoration and styling. This place is a must with a group of friends or families! 2 nights certainly didn’t feel long enough. Bridget’s attention to detail was impeccable, not a single thing wasn’t considered."

It was spotlessly clean. The hosts also left a welcoming message with a bottle of wine and chocolates.<br/>The beds were comfortable, the heating was efficient, overall a very comfortable home.<br/>One of our party is an Airbnb superhost and she asked me to pass on her compliments to the hosts. Highly recommended."

Kirsten was kind and helpful with lots of great suggestions for places to visit in the area. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommended her home as a peaceful get away in the Barossa."
49197946,388589692964541281,2021-06-19,403006331,Amber,Great house not being able to use the kitchen was a bit of a bummer. Finding out that the owner was going to be staying in the house was surprising and not what we were expecting. Great house but felt like we had to be in the bedroom for privacy while the owner was in the house. Incredible bath tub
49197946,393706271399280073,2021-06-27,188951025,Bec,"Great house, modern, well decorated and Kirsten is very accomodating. Great place to stay for the weekend!"
49197946,403826733638244589,2021-07-11,8788977,Gils,"Amazing setting with magnificent views. Kristen so obviously enjoys sharing her space and is both a generous host and discreet in her ability to truly share her space. She provides a generous hamper of provisions and a whole shelf in the fridge.<br/>The accommodation is sumptuous - as others have mentioned the bath is terrific, the wood burner  was also effective in reaching our bedroom, an oil heater was also provided but we did not feel the need. Kirsten is passionate about this off grid experience and it shows in her thoughtful attention to detail.<br/>We really enjoyed getting to know Angaston better, great food, shops and fab bike hire service and cycle track.<br/>Would not hesitate to recommend."
49197946,408962215275711250,2021-07-18,61897996,Don,"Great spot, everything was fantastic and Kirsten was an excellent and welcoming host. Relaxing by the fire after a day out in the winter rain and cold was a treat and the view across the valley was awesome."

49197946,448034776353859527,2021-09-10,44199859,Ruth,Beautiful home and the view is phenomenal - surely the best view of the Barossa! Kirsten was so lovely and communicated well ahead and during my stay. All the facilities were as described and the bed very comfortable. Can absolutely recommend and I will certainly be heading back again next time I stay in the Barossa.

49200495,766038061,2021-06-04,402675235,Charlie,"Fantastic house, the hottub and whole backyard setup is incredible and well worth a stay. Two minute walk from the Barossa brewery which was a nice suprise! And a very short drive into the heart of Tanunda. Very happy with the possum cottage!"
49200495,397290182952818733,2021-07-01,196990911,Belinda,"Nick was a great communicator during our stay. <br/>The outdoor area is a great space for chilling out and a lot of thought has gone into the landscaping and layout which has a Balinese type vibe.  The outdoor spa room is very relaxing - would highly recommend. <br/>The bedrooms are roomy and beds were comfortable.  If you are a light sleeper, pop some ear plugs in your overnight bag as the property is on a main road.<br/>The cellar was a unique feature and great for family meal time!<br/>Functional kitchen and lovely fresh eggs for you to cook up at breakky.<br/>The location of the property is nice and close to town and a good spot if you are wanting a weekend get away to explore the wine region."
49200495,401689329157383486,2021-07-08,26172368,Matt,Beautiful garden and spa

49200495,406721929432722412,2021-07-15,52916556,Dawn,"This place is a hidden gem ! It’s quirky, cool, cozy, close to the town but a tranquil paradise. Outdoor hot tub in Japanese style garden makes you feel miles from anywhere. The building is historical and the owners have nurtured that but with every mod con that you need. There were no issues with checking in and would definitely give this place a 5 star rating"
49200495,408261950197898238,2021-07-17,93547224,Ty,Fantastic accomodation. Will definitely be back.

49200495,412585259864330706,2021-07-23,97748614,Jonathan & Karli,"A hot fire and a hot tub - perfect for the chilly hills! The uniqueness of the cottage is great, like stepping into an alternate reality. The wine cellar is a great place to chill out with a glass, or dinner. The hot tub is the perfect way to relax. And the lounge is a comfy space to watch a roaring fire and rest a weary body. The bed is one of the largestand and comfiest beds we've ever slept in - it was hard to start the day!! We spent a sudden lockdown in Little Possum Cottage, and it was the perfect place to be stuck! 10/10 would do a lockdown there again!"

49200495,423403018629138187,2021-08-07,47096420,Lúcia,Nice and interesting place. Wish the fireplace had been on at arrival as it was a cold rainy day and the cottage is quite cold. <br/>SPA is outside with no door so difficult to use/possibly not worth it on cold days. <br/>Host was accommodating and efficient communicator.
49200495,424889899022950158,2021-08-09,123382406,Denise,"Quaint, clean and comfy home with beautiful outdoor area.  Awesome hosts."

I booked Nick's place for my parents to get away for my mum's 60th, and Nick went above and beyond, even leaving a lovely birthday gift for my mum. I definitely recommend. Thanks again Nick."

The bed is massive,  sturdy and comfortable!<br/>Nick and Aloe are great hosts,  easy to communicate to and very welcoming (gave us wines, chocolates, eggs for breakfast). The jacuzzi is amazing! <br/>We enjoyed our honeymoon stay in the Possum Cottage! <br/>Make sure you try Barossa Bar & Brewery across the road for good food and drinks!"

49200495,463270677694078287,2021-10-01,44730095,Jamin,The Little Possum Cottage was AMAZING! One of the nicest places we’ve stayed! A private oasis within a stone’s throw of everything the Barossa Valley has to offer.<br/>The jacuzzi hut and secluded garden brought to mind memories of Bali. The beautiful colonial interior to the cottage was immaculately kept and provided the perfect setting for a romantic get away. The “cottage” was very roomy if you have a family as well with 2 comfortable king sized beds and 2 single beds. Lots of yummy eateries close by if you don’t feel like cooking in the well laid-out kitchen and of course the famed cellar door experiences of the Barossa can be extended in to the evening with the charming dining room located in the underground cellar which was particularly suited to carry on the luxury and spirit of the day’s wine touring. We plan on returning! Many thanks!
49200495,465499240167602614,2021-10-04,398947618,Andrea,"Wow. Just wow. We found Nick friendly and easy to communicate with, and the booking and check in process easy and hassle-free. The cottage was exactly as described, but the photos don't do it justice. It had so much more to offer but that's such a nice little surprise, as were the wines and other little extras provided by the host. A beautifully appointed character cottage. This is now our favourite place to stay in the Barossa!!"
49200495,466216100586866434,2021-10-05,29350003,Dana,"Amazing Airbnb!! Love the jacuzzi and the fireplace. Great for a couple's romantic escape. Hosts were very helpful and responsive to messages as well! Lots of thoughtful little touches to the accomodation. Although it's advertised as no kitchen, I'd classify what they have as a functional kitchen. Make sure you pack slippers and bathrobes with you because this place has amazing retreat vibes!"

Lovely and close to food - walking distance to town. <br/>The garden was a great place to sit and have my morning coffee. <br/>It was a great place to sit and unwind after a day exploring the Barossa and all it has to offer. <br/><br/>We didn’t manage to spot the possum family unfortunately though - maybe the next people who stay will be lucky enough to!
49200495,482798995418453105,2021-10-27,369788406,Raman,Great place to stay with family....feel like  living in Bali.... specially Jacuzzi and outdoor garden.

So many small details that was there for us that you just can’t get at a novotel in which we stayed many times now. Our only wish was that we could have found this little hidden gem 💎 earlier. It is our new favourite place in the Barossa and can’t wait to come back! Totally mind blown!! Thanks nick 👌👍😍🙌"

49200495,495190328601673174,2021-11-14,81489104,Alice,"The Possum Cottage was a lovely, snug and relaxing stay. Walking through the garden entrance we were really impressed with the tranquility of the outdoor area, especially the jacuzzi, and we loved the cottage itself. The kitchen had enough facilities for basic cooking, we loved the fresh farm eggs for breakfast that waited for us and were also quite excited to see complimentary wine was also set out for us. <br/><br/>The bedrooms were super comfortable with lovely big beds with warm and cosy good quality linen and the underground cellar was fun to have a wine in after we’d put our baby to bed. <br/><br/>The accom was walking distance to the Main Street cafes and shops and it was also literally across the road from Barossa Valley Brewing which is a good pit stop for lunch.<br/><br/>A fantastic option for your stay in Tanunda, especially when the weather is cool, it’s a great winter stay to relax on the chesterfields in front of the fire with a wine and to warm up in the outdoor hot tub. <br/><br/>Thanks again for having us!"

49200495,520511989219809998,2021-12-18,434342355,Joanne,"This is a little hidden gem.  On arrival it was fun exploring the place and had an awesome time. The spa was lovely with candles in there too.   The beds were comfy and big.  The cellar was lovely to enjoy a platter and a glass of wine, when it was quite warm outside.  Convenient to all facilities with a pub across the road which played live music, to the main street for breakfast.  Highly recommend. 5 stars from us."

49200495,530619974913168141,2022-01-01,191789833,Alex,"Great location, beautiful home and great entertaining space - probably more suited to cooler months however as the home remained very hot and uncomfortable throughout our stay (was the first heatwave of the Summer though - the aircon just couldn’t handle it unfortunately). Otherwise could not fault it!"
49200495,532832163462542390,2022-01-04,193572319,Allysha,Possum Cottage was just what we were after for our first time visiting the Barossa Valley! We were blown away by the garden as you entered the cottage and loved the luxurious spa addition! Perfect location in the heart of Tanunda ✨
49200495,534260411529289665,2022-01-06,10063571,Karen,"Great location, close to all the Barossa has to offer."

The property has a beautiful, large yard equipped with outdoor fire pits and a dual hammock. We enjoyed the tranquility here! Mark was also very responsive to messages (even when we messaged him late). Highly recommend this one to anyone wanting a quiet little getaway."

49448518,388644083402033344,2021-06-20,216636260,Laura,This place is absolutely adorable!! So well restored but still maintaining its 1800’s charm. Bedrooms were so well put together and the fireplace adds such a nice atmosphere! The outside area is also absolutely stunning; if it hadn’t rained all weekend we would have loved to have utilised it more! Also quite close to all the great wineries but much better value than staying directly next to the wineries.. which is a big bonus :)
49448518,403897390897860144,2021-07-11,91051651,Kim,Great central spot lovely animals and frogs x close to fab pizza and forest walks
49448518,406787680515923955,2021-07-15,91251897,Sadie,We wanted a cosy rustic character cottage with interesting features and this cottage ticked all the boxes. <br/>Really enjoyed the garden with the eclectic array of animals to visit.<br/>Enjoyed how the cottage was linked to historic events in Springton via the Heldig family tree. <br/>The whole set up felt relaxed and welcoming. The hosts checked we had settled in but didn't impose upon us. <br/>Great family holiday with all the mod cons.
49448518,411163466227948720,2021-07-21,146854228,Jessica,"A lovely stay that was cut short due to a lockdown! Mark and Fiona were very accommodating and everything was clean, tidy and welcoming. We brought our little toy poodle along with us with approval from the hosts and she loved sleeping by the fireplace. Springton is close to Mt Crawford for forest walks and relatively close to the Barossa so there's plenty to do. We would definitely recommend The Stables for a relaxing weekend away."
49448518,421940662620694266,2021-08-05,218559026,Teagan,"Mark and Fiona’s place is great! The bed is comfy, the fire place is so nice and toasty and the shower pressure combined with the shower head makes it hard to leave! We really enjoyed our stay and the recommendations on where to eat. Definitely great value for money. It is a lovely cottage that helps you escape reality and unwind!"

We were lucky enough to have the entire tasting deck and view of the vineyards to ourselves which is pretty special.  Great location with a hire car.  Nicely styled room and comfy bed.

Loved every bit of this room from the plush carpet to the gorgeous lighting options; so much thought has been put in and it shows. Had the best sleep in the king bed, kitted out with quality linen, and enjoyed the giant waterfall shower-head. Could not ask for a better location, central to everything. Unfortunately the cellar door wasn’t open the weekend we stayed, so we weren’t able to try their wines, however this meant we had the grounds to ourselves which was lovely and private. Highly recommend and will be back to stay again!"

So well equipped from the kitchen to the excellent kids play area. Our kids loved catching yabbies in the dam & we enjoyed the vista including some beautiful sunsets.

We were granted with one of the most beautiful sunsets we’ve ever seen on the neighbouring hill. The house it self is a real treat and you can see a lot of love has been put into it.

We'll definitely be booking another trip, Thanks so much!"

50778506,455297539459315374,2021-09-20,183800938,Pero,We enjoyed our stay very much.

50778506,484245535039987669,2021-10-29,52993308,Liesl,This is a gorgeous character cottage with a historic feel but all the modern amenities needed. The hosts are very responsive. Would highly recommend hiring bikes in Angaston to explore the area!
50778506,496604121654770721,2021-11-15,55321614,Evan,"This is a gorgeous little cottage right in the heart of the Barossa, but far enough off the main track that it's also peaceful and quiet! If you choose to stay here, you'll be able to enjoy all the Barossa and surrounding regions have to offer, with your own little slice of tranquility to return home to. The front verandah is perfect for lounging around sipping any bottles of wine you may have picked up whilst out visiting the vineyards, not to mention the huge spa bath in the bathroom! <br/><br/>The place is easy to find, communication prior to check in was superb and we didn't have any drama's throughout our stay, would happily stay again. <br/><br/>The cottage, being quite old, is quite small but there are two bedrooms, a combined kitchen/dining, a living area with a large fire if it gets too cold, plus a laundry, bathroom and toilet which are all separate. It's on the smaller side when it comes to the kitchen/dining but the rest of the room is more than spacious enough with the living having two large couches. <br/><br/>The shower on our first morning was quite bad, not much more than a drip, however, this issue didn't seem to happen again so not sure what went on there. We did realise that if running the shower/bath the toilet would take forever to fill up, so perhaps being as old as it is it can really only cope with one thing running water at a time. Wasn't an issue once we figured it out and just made sure we didn't use anything when showering. We had a spa every evening as soon as our daughter went to bed, it's easily large enough for two adults and we found it the perfect way to relax with a glass of wine in hand to finish off a day exploring the region. <br/><br/>You WILL need a car if staying here. You can use taxi's but no other public transport heads that way. You're only a short, five minute drive from the nearest town, Angaston. It's got a few places to eat and most do take-away's. It's also not too much further to Narioopta with even more options for dining/drinking. We found the location was perfect but we had a car. <br/><br/>We went to the supermarket and got ourselves some staples for breakfast, turns out, we shouldn't have. The fridge and pantry were well stocked with bacon, eggs, bread, jams and all other sorts of stuff. I think there were even baked beans and some sausages. There was a glass of dessert wine on the shelf with some chocolates, a jar with some cookies and a few other nice little touches like these. We tried to just eat the stuff we had with us, but the cookies were delicious and my daughter found the chocolates! <br/><br/>All in all, if you're looking for a beautiful little cottage that stays true to it's era, with the added touch of a beautiful relaxing bath, look no further! We loved it! :) <br/><br/>Will definitely stay again if returning to the Barossa region."

The house is located within walking/biking distance to some wonderful wineries (you must have a cheese board at David Frances Winery overlooking the rolling vineyard views). The house was cosy and had 3 bedrooms each with its own en-suite which made the perfect home for 3 couples travelling together or a family.

Perfectly situated, a short walk to shops/cafes/parks & a short drive to wineries & other interesting little towns. The house itself is fully equipped with everything you could possibly need for a short or long stay.  Bed linen & towels are a beautiful quality & the bright study area was perfect for work. Our little dog was obsessed with exploring the garden, she loved it! <br/>A special mention to Steph, our host, who went out of her way to help & accommodate us during a very difficult period. Communication was excellent & her care & concern really touched us. I can’t recommend this property (& host) enough."

Spacious and separate living areas for us to spread out, all cooking facilities that you may require if you're staying in for dinner. As a reminder of how short in stature Cornish miners must have been our very tall 6ft 5 son was amused to have to duck his head through the doorways, he's glad he wasn't  a miner. <br/>Also a must see at Kapunda was the museum. Allow plenty of time to take it all in as you will be transported back in time."
