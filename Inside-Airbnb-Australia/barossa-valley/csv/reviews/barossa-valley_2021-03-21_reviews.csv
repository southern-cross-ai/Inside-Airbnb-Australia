1125097,10081118,2014-01-29,1898281,Rus,"Great host and amazing accommodation!  

We went to celebrate Lizzy's 30th and the Coach House could not have been more perfect.

Flying into Adelaide, we stopped at the Central Market downtown and stocked up on supplies for the weekend.  After an leisurely hour and a bit drive we arrived at Strathlyn BNB where we were met by Heather. 

She took us to the Coach House on the back of the property and it couldnt have been nicer.

Great view out of the top level balcony overlooking the vineyard. 

A/C and fans proved to be invaluable on a 38 degree weekend!

All amenities are better than expected and all you could want.

This place is a short walk (5 mins) to Saltrams and a 20 min walk to the farmers market on Saturday morning.  

We hired bikes (had them delivered and picked up) and made an easy 25 km loop to quite a few wineries and Maggie Beer's Farm Shop.  There is a great bike path that starts in Angaston and goes into the heart of the Barossa.

1125097,10335170,2014-02-14,2725224,Teresa,"A lovely and convenient location, surrounded by grapes!  Far away enough from the main house to have as much privacy as you need.  Breakfast is included - eggs, bacon, juice and a bottle of wine.  If you are keen to cook some of the amazing local produce, there is an electric hot plate and microwave, but no oven.  Aircon works well.  "
1125097,10881952,2014-03-11,8982612,Kathy,A wonderful experience from start to finish . We will be back . Amazing location . Beautiful cottage . Immaculate attention to detail that made our stay just perfect . 
1125097,11872081,2014-04-17,10977428,Phillip,The coach house is in a lovely location. We were fortunate enough to be there watch the sun set to the west just as the moon came up over the vineyard to the west. The accommodation is clean and generously appointed. Recommended.
1125097,13189669,2014-05-21,1304769,Lilia,What a great place to stay in Barossa! Luxury private coach house overlooking a vineyard. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and the sunset from the deck. The host was very friendly and helpful.
1125097,14372675,2014-06-17,16453786,Bianca,We had a lovely weekend at Strathlyn Coach House. Heather was a fantastic host. She made us feel very welcome and made fantastic recommendations for our weekend in the Barossa. The Coach House was gorgeous - beautiful views & everything you'd possibly need. The location was great - very close to Angaston & still very private. We'd certainly stay here again.     
1125097,16560082,2014-07-29,1122028,Natasha,"Heather made us feel extremely welcome by telling us a little about the house, and with a bottle of wine and a packed fridge! She's very personably and willing to answer all questions. 
The location couldn't be more picturesque and made me so happy to have wine and cheese on the veranda which had uninterrupted views of the vineyard, with not a house in sight. 
We would definitely recommend to anyway thinking about staying. "
1125097,19676815,2014-09-16,76497,Chris,"A hidden gem, nestled in the vines between Angaston and Nuriootpa. So quiet and peaceful – I'd highly recommend this to anyone staying for a few days in the Barossa."
1125097,20504718,2014-09-30,20096212,Natalie,The coach house is set in a beautiful location and is conveniently located for exploring the Barossa. Heather was warm and welcoming and had stocked the fridge providing a delicious breakfast spread for us to enjoy at our leisure each morning. The house is well maintained and furnished comfortably. But best of all you can grab a glass of wine and sit on the upstairs balcony while enjoying the sunset and views over the vineyards. Highly recommended.  
1125097,21393629,2014-10-16,9457572,Mark,"The Coach House was very cosy and well appointed in a beautiful setting. Just what we were looking for. Heather made us feel very welcome, was able to answer all our questions regarding the area and gave us some fabulous suggestions regarding wineries, coffee and dining throughout the Barossa and even McLaren Vale."
1125097,22204359,2014-11-01,10624389,Cindy,Lovely stay at the Strathlyn Coach House.  Beautifully situated and conveniently located - we found it to be a great home base for us to explore the Barossa and Eden Valley regions!

1125097,23753581,2014-12-09,13683732,Renee,"Strathlyn was a great place to stay for a weekend away. Heather was really quick to respond and was very easy to contact on arrival etc. the studio was lovely with an amazing little balcony overlooking the vines, and in an easy position for sightseeing around the area. All was as expected from the listing! Would definitely recommend it to others. "
1125097,24020179,2014-12-17,16955023,David,A wonderful secluded place in the middle of a vineyard. The cottage was well stocked with breakfast goodies. Information on site was helpful. 
1125097,28774257,2015-03-30,21199797,Penelope,"We had a lovely stay at the Coach House which is a beautifully restored building. It was very comfortable and private, set on the edge of a vineyard. Heather the host was very helpful, there is so much to see and do in the area, great vineyards, cafés, restaurants and on a Saturday the Barossa Farmers Market is just down the road. We would definitely recommend staying at the Coach House!"
1125097,31734308,2015-05-09,26976969,Melissa,"We spent three nights at the coach house. Location was excellent, with nice views from the balcony.  The weather was blustery and cold at times, but there are two heaters provided in addition to the bedroom unit. Kitchen was stocked to make a nice breakfast and simple dinners. "
1125097,35211602,2015-06-16,25014261,Garry,"Our stay at The Coach house was delightful. Heather was friendly and helpful when it came to local info on where to go and what to do. I would recommend staying at Strathlyn yo anyone travelling to the Barossa, it's central and easy to get around to entire district. "

1125097,37380726,2015-07-06,34329031,Leonie,"Heather was very friendly on our arrival and made us feel welcome at the Strathlyn Estate. 
Everything that describes the Strathlyn Coach House on Airbnb is exactly what you get. The bed on mezzanine level was so comfortable with the sun shining through the door to the balcony each morning. You can't ask for anything more with views all round the Coach House. The bacon and eggs which were obviously from local produce were very fresh and yummy.
The Coach House is very private from the main house and has its on driveway so that you can come and go without feeling that you are opposing on the hosts.  
The Barossa Farmers Market is only a short walk from the Coach House and wow the homemade Beef & Red Wine pies and the fruit tarts were amazing.
If you need a relaxing and no fuss weekend or few days away this is the place to stay."
1125097,37899195,2015-07-11,20987637,Troy,We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn house in the Barossa. When we arrived there was a beautiful bottle of wine and breakfast provisions on hand. The accommodation was perfect for our short stay in the Valley. Its perfectly located between the main towns of the Barossa.
1125097,40978732,2015-08-03,33969993,Shara,"We LOVED our stay at Strathlyn coach house, it was such a quaint little stone cottage set in an idyllic setting, surrounded by vines and fruit trees. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay. And to top it all off Heather was a friendly and welcoming host. Cottage was well stocked and had everything we needed, great location also! Close to all the wineries. Will stay again :) "
1125097,45378530,2015-09-02,6576334,Duane,"We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn coach house.  Heather made us feel very welcome and gave us some good insights to local places to visit.

She also provided plenty of cereal, eggs, bacon, bread and milk for breakfast.  It is right next door to Saltram winery and she also left us a bottle of their wine which we enjoyed.

It is a beautiful location nestled in amongst the vines and has a good view of the surrounding area.  The cottage is very private but only a minute walk to the main house.

The Barossa Valley is quite compact and it is an easy drive to most of the wineries.  Angaston is only a minute drive away and Nuriootpa is only about 5 minutes drive.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1125097,46889500,2015-09-14,12560317,Natalie,"Heather was a wonderful host. She was very flexible in regards to our check-in time which was very kind. Heather was also very helpful in providing advice on where to visit in the area and things to do. The accommodation is beautiful and very peaceful, with a generous stock of food for breakfast. We used the gym during our stay, the facilities in the gym were perfect for what we needed. 

I would highly recommend Heather as a host, and we hope to stay again next time we are visiting the Barossa."

1125097,50177730,2015-10-10,41666843,Hamish,Heather was an absolutely amazing host! Would highly recommend this for accomodation in the Barossa! All the information you need to navigate your way through the wineries is neatly arranged for you by Heather. Breakfast was provided and Heather was always helpful when we needed help on where to head in the valley. An incredibly central location and picturesque surrounds. We were absolutely amazed at how secluded we were yet still so close to everything. Will definitely be back again! Thanks again heather! 
1125097,51364168,2015-10-19,45858541,John,Heather was very friendly welcoming and helpful.  The Coach house is lovely and the setting is peaceful and relaxing. Loved breakfast on te balcony at the back overlooking the vineyards.  It is within walking distance of Saltram's winery and a slightly longer walk or very short drive to the Barossa Farmers Market.
1125097,52206756,2015-10-27,34543599,Teresa,"Very comfortable, clean and quiet cottage. Most enjoyable stay at a delightful property. Very private with lovely views.

1125097,54110068,2015-11-16,37655181,Lara,"Heather was very welcoming and had stocked the house with everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. 

The coach house was as pretty in real life as it is in all the pictures and the perfect place for a romantic weekend away for two. We had a lovely afternoon sitting on the balcony overlooking the vineyards with some cheese and wine bought nearby. 

There was also a new laundry and gym which unfortunately we didn't have time to use but would definitely be useful if you were planning a longer stay. "
1125097,55975423,2015-12-07,10646560,Hayley,Beautiful converted barn in a stunning setting. Fab wine tasting venue next door and fantastic restaurant down the road in walking distance. We had a lovely time. Heather is very helpful and the barn has everything you could possibly need for a romantic break in the Barossa. The little extras Heather left help you get started and relax you into the break. Thank you.
1125097,56841927,2015-12-19,7769196,Gill,We had a great time at Heathers coach house. Great location and everything you need to explore this fabulous region. Heather was very friendly and gave us good eating tips. A private and beautiful place. 
1125097,57362528,2015-12-25,26235245,Julie,"What a fabulous location for guests spending time in the Barossa Valley.   The coach house was unique, quaint and private but still so close to Angaston for restaurants ect.  Heather provided supplies for a bacon and egg breakfast and a lovely bottle of wine.  We enjoyed having a drink on the rear balcony overlooking the Vineyard.  Recommend the coach house for a stay with a touch of history. Very enjoyable, thank you Heather."
1125097,58938449,2016-01-05,2975981,Kyle,"Great accommodation in the heart of the Barossa.

The coach house is tucked around the back so we felt like we had plenty of privacy. Inside it was clean and comfortable.

Angaston is a cute little town with a small grocery store and some yummy places to eat."
1125097,60378905,2016-01-23,10463054,Kate,Heather is a very welcoming and generous host. Very knowledgeable and accommodating. We had a wonderful stay at the Coach House. Great location.
1125097,61490586,2016-02-05,52824036,Michael,"We had a great stay at Strathlyn Coach House in February 2016.
The accommodation was neat, tidy and comfortable, Heather made us feel very welcome and was flawless organised.
This is a great spot to stay if you'd like to be near plenty of local wineries, but not in the heart of Tanunda/Barossa; but have very peaceful and secluded nights.
The view was outstanding, surrounding pleasants and overall was a great find for us."
1125097,62571412,2016-02-15,6920494,Maria,"The Coach house has kept all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. 

Heather stocked the fridge with lots of breakfast goodies including bacon, eggs, bread, milk, oj and even a bottle of moscato!

The deck out the back gives a panoramic view of vineyards and was perfect for star gazing and watching the sunrise!

Thank you for your hospitality and sharing your charming cottage with us!"
1125097,64934831,2016-03-09,9474833,Rand,We had a fantastic time in the Barossa and from the get go we felt welcome and at home at Strathlyn. It was very very hot when we arrived and Heather had made sure to cool the coach house down by putting on the aircon earlier. These kinds of thoughtful touches sum up the experience. Situated amongst the vineyards this is a wonderful place to stay in the region.
1125097,66349987,2016-03-22,37121832,Ian,"We really had the most fabulous short break in the Barossa.  Thanks to Heather's suggestions, we got to enjoy the scrumptious fresh produce at the Farmers market, great food and service at Vintner's and Wanera.  We tasted some great wines and met some really friendly and knowledgeable staff at Taste Eden Valley, Turkey Flat, Rockford's, MSV and TeAro.  A highlight was staying in the Coach house @ Strathlyn surrounded by Saltram's vineyards and enjoying a glass or two on the rear deck watching the sun go down or a morning cuppa watching the hot air balloons meander around the valley.  Heather was the perfect host and has added her personal touch to make your stay even more enjoyable.  It was only 4 days but we left feeling relaxed and re-charged!!!  We highly recommend Strathlyn as a great base for a real Barossa experience."
1125097,68506417,2016-04-05,18611402,Lanny,The coach house was very homely and had everything we needed for our two night stay. Heather was very welcoming and even had breakfast for us!

1125097,77207376,2016-05-30,31717142,Elizabeth And Peter,"The Strathlyn Coach House was as cute and comfortable as described.

The property perfectly matched the description and was really lovely. The view of the vineyard from the balcony in the morning was wonderful! This is the perfect location in the Barossa as it's close to everything but secluded.
1125097,78975989,2016-06-10,53997653,Dan,A truly beautiful cottage set amongst the vines - a spectacular and unique experience.

1125097,79798120,2016-06-14,10029038,David,"Heather was very helpful in showing us the lovely converted coach house and even had the heating on for us. Generous cooked brekky supplies were included as was an excellent bottle of red, Pepperjack one of our favs! They even have a Nespresso machine. This unique location overlooks the vineyard directly with its own balcony. It's also located minutes away from Salters (who make Pepperjack) & Vintners restaurants; we dined at both and they were excellent.. particularly the award winning Vintners. Here's some photos of this wonderful property & surrounds. (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1125097,86898919,2016-07-18,73709119,Bridget,"We had a lovely stay at the Strathlyn Coach House. Very scenic views of the vineyards directly from the balcony attached to the bedroom.

1125097,102943582,2016-09-19,84798428,Matt,"Thank you Heather for making us feel so welcome and comfortable during our stay. The coach house was exactly like we imagined and the pictures and description don't do it justice, it was warm and cosy and the views are outstanding. It's very private and secluded away from main dwelling, perfect for a romantic getaway for a few nights but also accommodating for a long stay. We had such a lovely time here, it will stay with us forever! Thanks"

1125097,114937262,2016-11-20,83888401,Alan,"We had a fantastic stay at the coach house. It was a gorgeous setting, nestled in rolling hills of vineyards and beautifully kept gardens surrounding the property. The coach house was clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The newly renovated balcony overlooking the vineyards was perfect for enjoying the complimentary local Riesling. The location was great for tripping around the Barossa Valley. We hired bikes one day and cycled some of the new bike trail, highly recommended. 
Thanks again Heather for being a wonderful host."

1125097,136646949,2017-03-11,50436829,Samuel,"An absolutely fantastic air bnb in an absolutely sensational location. Hands down the most incredible experience I have had. The place was cosy and romantic, had a little bit of history and was perfect to come back to after a day on the wineries! The only thing better than this air bnb is Heather herself, who has made (and continues to make for the entirety of your stay) an incredible effort to make your time a memorable one. Five stars does not do this place justice and I will be staying here whenever I return to the Barossa (as long as it isnt booked out!)"
1125097,138077116,2017-03-18,49906487,Chuck,We had a lovely stay here during March. Was great to have some quiet time on beautiful surrounds.

1125097,203887009,2017-10-15,153059432,Raymond,The coach house was everything we needed on our 2 day trip to the Barossa Valley. It was secluded yet reasonable driving distance to all the places we wanted to visit. Heather was a 5/5 house.
1125097,206737793,2017-10-26,34949341,Roberta,"The Coach House is very well positioned for exploring the delights of the Barossa.  It is very quiet and peaceful and the deck off the bedroom is lovely for a cuppa or glass of wine while admiring the view, including a kangaroo and her joey during our stay.
Heather is very helpful and the taxi company she recommended were great.  They took us to restaurants for dinner and were a mine of information.
The downstairs area of the Coach House is quite small although the bedroom is large and airy.  It's an old stone building that was renovated about 20+ years ago set in lovely gardens that are quiet and private."

Quaint cottage with awesome view over the vineyards. Very close to Angaston, which is a lovely town to explore. ""Country breakfast"" provisions were delicious and very thoughtful."

1125097,271973914,2018-06-02,48133639,Eugene,"Exactly the type of place you wish for when thinking of a weekend in a wine region. The place is private and quiet with beautiful views directly over a local vineyard. A converted coach house with a loft bedroom, it is just the right size for 2 people.

Heather was a lovely host who ran us through the local attractions, and provided us with some breakfast ingredients, wine and other essentials!"

1125097,414184733,2019-02-18,3263629,Chad,"Cute cottage tucked away in a vineyard. What more could a person want? It will be difficult to forget sitting on that back porch watching the sun go down. 
Walking distance to Vitners Bar And Grill, (one of the best meals we had on our 3 week Australian vacation).
The bonus was heading out onto the deck for morning coffee and seeing a family of kangaroo (mama, pop and little Joey)20 feet from deck."

Couldn’t recommend a more picturesque place to get away from it all."

1125097,643129452,2020-07-27,170677807,Juliane,Beautiful spot to escape. It was lovely in winter and it must be even better in warm seasons or in autumn

1125097,700095185,2020-10-12,28028841,Michael,"Heather is a hospitable host. She's a sweet lady who offered some great recommendations for smaller, lesser-known wineries. Though we didn't cook breakfast, she provided bacon, eggs, bread, and milk. There was also orange juice, coffee, and cereals. Her cottage is in a great location. Secluded but not far from the town and other wineries. It cannot be emphasized enough that the view from the balcony, particularly during sunrise and sunset, is amazing, though the flies can be a nuisance."
1125097,701318492,2020-10-17,191793753,Jacqueline,"A wonderfully restored 1900 cottage, perfectly situated in a way that makes you feel like you are surround by your very own private vineyard. This is a very intimate space and perfect for us on a short stay during our honeymoon. It’s location is perfect for access to the Barossa Valley, our tour picked us up from our front door. You will also be only a short drive from the beautiful town of Angaston for lovely food and atmosphere. Heather provided exceptional hospitality from the bacon and eggs to the local knowledge of the area, absolutely worth a visit."
1125097,708856840,2020-11-14,90774488,Ryan,Beautiful location backing onto the vines with an amazing view. Lovely hosts and a cosy little stay. Highly recommend
1125097,713986187,2020-12-06,184155186,Glen,Lovely little place to stay within the heart of the Barossa! Private and a nice cosy vibe with beautiful views from the upstairs deck.
1125097,717998201,2020-12-25,6357197,Anthony,"Such a lovely private cottage with stunning surroundings!  Plenty of cosy places to sit and enjoy the vineyard scenery. A 3 minute drive to the local town (Angaston) and a very central location to explore the wineries of the Barossa Valley. Plenty of space and amenities provided - a full kitchen, plenty of towels and nice linens as well as a fridge stocked with provisions. There's also a new small, but well-equiped gym and also guest laundry facilities. Heather  is absolutely lovely and a fantastic host. We were gifted a lovely bottle of Barossa Shiraz from the winery right next door (Saltram) to enjoy during our stay as well as surprised us with a lovely bottle of sparkling on our departure day as a Christmas present. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely come back here next time we're spending time in the Barossa Valley. We had a fantastic stay."
1125097,718983078,2020-12-27,7657219,Rhett,"A real little Barossa Valley gem - can't recommend  the location, amenities, hospitality and sunsets from the balcony with a locally sourced glass of wine highly enough. Big thanks again Heather!"
1125097,719560222,2020-12-29,162855468,Melissa,"We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn Coach House. Nestled amongst the vineyard in a great location in Angaston. House was clean and today, with a cute loft to sleep in. 
Will definitely return. Thanks Heather."
1125097,720243397,2020-12-31,185456736,Leiah,Beautiful location and very private. Heather greeted us with interesting details about the house and provided suggestions for local cellar doors. A very warm welcome and we appreciated the extra touches such as full breakfast provisions and a bottle of wine!
1125097,722913079,2021-01-09,374834130,Jayce,"The Couch House is in such a beautiful spot, the balcony is surrounded by vines and provides a great place for an afternoon drink (or a marriage proposal). Heather is a fantastic host who provided the extra touches to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Highly recommend Strathlyn Estate for a getaway to the Barossa!"
1125097,724275397,2021-01-15,5493294,Emerald,"Perfect location in such a charming town, amazing views, kind and helpful host. Everything you need in the coach house - even an iron!"
1133195,20499578,2014-09-30,2941754,Suz,"Heather was brilliant, very welcoming and helpful. Her booklet inside the apartment was very helpful explaining how to do things and interesting ideas. Thanks for the bottle of wine in the fridge in addition to the great kitchen set up."
1133195,22080257,2014-10-29,22510871,Chelsea,"Lemon Tree Spa apartment was a beautiful place for a weekend away. There is a great view outside the windows of vineyards and well kept flowers. Heather has the appartment well stocked with groceries to make a good breakfast to start the day, the nepresso machine is a nice touch. Our first night was spent cracking open the complimentary wine, watching the dvds provided and scouring through the tonnes of information Heather provides about what is around. Heather even provides the bubble bath for the spa. Angaston is a lovely town with a supermarket open til 8, and is close to everything Barossa, yet far enough away to feel completely lost amongst the vineyards. You're in walking distance of Saltram Winery and Vitners Bar and Grill aswell as the town of Angaston if feeling like stretching the legs."
1133195,27775483,2015-03-11,23922905,Aidan,Heather made us feel very welcome and when we had some flight arrival changes she was more than happy to help. The property was exactly as described and I truly wish I could have stayed longer. Beautiful atmosphere and a great leaping point for adventures in the Barossa Valley.
1133195,49651331,2015-10-05,29355110,Kath,"Great location, so close to everything, the bottle of chilled wine in the fridge was a nice touch. Helpful host, very accommodating, lovely relaxing holiday, thank you!"

Would definitely book again"
1133195,71522102,2016-04-25,63056452,Lee,"We were very happy with our stay at the Lemon Tree Spa at Strathlyn. Our host Heather was wonderful, and very helpful when we needed to make an unexpected trip home to attend to an urgent family matter, offering flexibility at the end of our stay after we were able to return. Her genuine interest and generosity was very much appreciated.
 The cottage is full of old worlde charm, comfortable and close to all the Barrosa offers, yet set in the middle of vineyards and an orchard, so very peaceful."
1133195,79750733,2016-06-14,72394166,Mitchell,"Heather was a great host, the cottage itself was perfect for a weekend away. A warm welcome with a great explanation on what to do around the area. The Lodge is very close to nearby wineries and small beautiful towns. While the house itself sits on a vinyard. Amazing weekend away, will no doubt be back again soon. "
1133195,86950935,2016-07-18,56456959,Just,"Heather made us feel very welcome and provided some really handy tips for the local area. The accommodation was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. The gardens are gorgeous! 
Thank you Heather for your beautiful accommodation. "
1133195,144942158,2017-04-16,2879875,Georg,"Heather is a fantastic host - and has a super friendly family. The lemon tree spa is a cute little house with all you need - full friedge for breakfast -  wirepool, DVD player and a selection of movies, a large garden and a well equipped gym facility! We would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. If you want even better views on the vinyarda just book heathers second accommodation. "
1133195,147122794,2017-04-25,124538850,Caryl,"Easy to find and as requested, Heather left us to our privacy for the whole three days. Lovely."
1133195,159887943,2017-06-12,3364193,Jojo,"We had such a lovely stay at Strathlyn Lemon Tree Spa! My boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights over the long weekend. We had a bottle of wine waiting for us in the fridge along with enough bacon, eggs and bread for an epic fry up the next day. It's an absolutely gorgeous spot, really picturesque, and Heather told us a little bit about the history of the big house. The bed was large and gloriously comfortable. The spa was bubbly and luxurious! We had a wonderful time and would absolutely recommend the place to friends. Ideally located close to Angaston, it's the perfect spot from which to explore the Barossa's Cellar Doors. In fact, I've written a list of the ones we most enjoyed in case it helps anyone! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1133195,199421135,2017-10-01,112438406,Carolyn,"We spent three nights at the Lemon Tree Spa, and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The cottage is nestled in beautiful grounds - there were flowers blooming everywhere when we visited and the view across the adjoining vineyard is stunning. Each night we sat outside with a glass of wine in hand and watched the sun go down over the vines. Just gorgeous. The location is fantastic - about a kilometre from the historic village of Angaston, just off the main road but set back enough to be peaceful and quiet, with all the delights of the Barossa wineries close at hand. 

The cottage is fully self-contained and completely separate from the main house. And while it doesn't look fancy from the outside, don't let this fool you! Inside it's beautifully and comfortably furnished, and feels light, airy and spacious.  I've stayed in other B&Bs that are pretty and picturesque, but so cramped that you trip over the furniture all the time. None of that here - there was plenty of room to unpack our things and spread out and relax. We had everything we needed, including pots and pans and kitchen equipment if we wanted to cook, DVDs to watch and magazines and books to read. The fridge was stocked with breakfast supplies and a bottle of wine was thoughtfully provided. I particularly appreciated the little dressing table in the spa area, where I could spread out my cosmetics and 'girly stuff' without getting in the way of my partner. (It's worth noting that while the spa is in a corner of the bedroom, the bathroom itself is located separately and totally private.) 

Heather was a genuinely warm and thoughtful host. We were travelling in an open-topped vintage car that needed protection from the weather, and she kindly allowed us to use her private garage. Thanks Heather!

The only issue we had was patchy wi-fi, but apparently this is a problem with the new NBN and out of the host's control. And when the setting is so beautiful, why would you want to stare at your device? 

I loved my first trip to the beautiful Barossa, and can't wait to visit again. I won't bother to research accommodation options next time - I'll just book into the Lemon Tree confident that I'll have a wonderful experience. Very highly recommended!"
1133195,202121433,2017-10-10,151746755,Brooke,"This is such a lovely place to stay for a weekend getaway. Heather was a very lovely and welcoming host. The house is very lovely and the spa is great to relax in. It is in a good location within walking distance to a winery and close bike riding or driving distance to Nuriootpa, Tanunda and a variety of wineries around. It's surrounded by a beautiful vineyard which is lovely to go for a walk through. We will definitely be staying again :)"
1133195,206122492,2017-10-23,150479373,Karen,"Strathlyn B&B is a lovely little cottage to spend a few days at.  Very handy to lots of nice restaurants and wineries.  Thoroughly enjoyed our few days there in October 2017.

Heather was incredibly helpful in showing us around the cottage and providing great dinner suggestions. Communication was great and key pick up was super easy. The cottage was so clean and well looked after. Great location, so close to amazing restaurants and we had a great time discovering the Barossa during the day.

1133236,52150483,2015-10-26,2302739,Duncan,Thank you Heather for making our 30th wedding anniversary such a memorable one. We had a fantastic weekend staying in the lovely Lily Room. The complimentary champagne and the spa were a perfect match. The breakfast was fantastic. The only problem was we could only stay one night! Thank you once again.

1133236,184489475,2017-08-19,11397364,Alex,Thanks for a great stay. The room was really nice especially the bathroom. Central to the Barossa valley with plenty of wineries around.

1133236,255898739,2018-04-22,17740875,Chris,We absolutely loved Heathers place and wished we could have stayed longer. Such a beautiful old homestead surrounded by lovely gardens and picturesque vineyard landscape. We really enjoyed the old world charm of the room and taking pictures in the Autumn colours around the property. Heather was very easy to communicate with and also gave us some great tips on places to eat nearby. Also Heather went out of her way to locate some information that I was seeking on the history of a particular wine maker that had been in the region for a long time. The check in was a breeze and heather was very flexible with the times. We look forward to returning to heathers beautiful home in the near future. Highly recommended.
1133236,329857695,2018-09-30,100750405,Jade,Beautiful estate in a great location!

1133236,574184424,2019-12-08,29713853,Marianne,"We stayed at the Lily Suite on the night of our wedding and we absolutely loved everything about it. Spacious, airy and so well kept, we were treated to the creature comforts of Heather’s hospitality upon arrival. We are very grateful for having accommodation such as Heather’s in our beautiful town of Angaston."
1133236,665935176,2020-09-20,147625813,Franc,"Lovely accommodation, central to many attractions, will definitely stay there again. Thanks Heather!"
1133236,671760823,2020-10-06,12401597,Karina,"We had a fabulous weekend at Heather's in the Barossa. Heather is very lovely, she made sure we had everything we needed, and even reminded us of the daylight savings change during our stay. 
We stayed in the 'Lily' room. The room had everything we needed,  comfy bed, the Spa was brilliant (it is a two-person spa, and has a 'long side' so both of us could stretch out our legs!) and it was in a very convenient location, while being super quiet.
We will stay here again on our next visit to the Barossa."
1133236,703451785,2020-10-25,212957251,Kate,Beautiful B&B in a lovely location. Heather’s place was a fantastic spot to spend the weekend and had everything we needed. So easy to communicate with. Thank you Heather!

1133236,737412600,2021-03-07,222926064,Laurie,Lovely private room. Heather provided us with a lovely greeting when we arrived. We were there for our long weekend and to visit the Barossa. Because of this Heather left us a beautiful wine. Everything was immaculately clean and well presented.
1710462,8503728,2013-11-03,5924987,Uyen,"A huge thanks to Tom and Kylie for making our trip through the barossa valley such a memorable experience. They were amazing hosts who went above and beyond our expectations. Tom, we are so grateful for your knowledge, experience and most of all your generosity in taking out the time to share that with us. This was definitely an awesome place to stay, highly recommended!"
1710462,8578734,2013-11-05,2187145,Sunni,"Kylie & Tom were thoughtful and caring hosts who made sure we had everything we needed and let us know they were nearby while leaving us to relax in peace in their quiet studio.
It's a good value bolt hole and the location is great if you're looking to tour the Barossa by car. It's lovely to be in the vines on their property. Thanks again!"
1710462,9137601,2013-12-09,724537,Alison & Jean-Philippe,"The Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed was a great base for a weekend of winery touring in the Barossa Valley. Very affordable (so you can spend more money on wine and food!), extremely comfortable, with high quality appliances and mostly Ikea furnishings. Even though we came prepared with soap and shampoo, it was all supplied, which was a lovely surprise. The setting was also lovely, set amongst the vineyards. It would be hard to get accommodation of this quality at the same price in the Barossa. Why would you stay at a dodgy, dated motor inn, when you can stay in a modern, inviting place like Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed! "
1710462,9368992,2013-12-24,10180676,Justin,"We had a great stay at the ""Shed."" It's located a little bit away from the main towns in the Barossa, but is very convenient and a perfect location for visiting the local wineries. In fact, being outside of town was a big plus for us. It has everything you'll need on site as well - we were able to enjoy a couple of relaxed nights in while cooking our own meals and enjoying local wines. A great spot for a visit to wine country. "
1710462,9465200,2013-12-30,3648835,Sitihassulaini,"We stayed for 2 night at Kylie and Tom's.  This is really an eye opener experience for us.  The location of the studio is awesome.  I love the idea of staying in the middle of grape field.  Our GPS broke down and we got lost on our way to the studio.  Tom is very helpful, he fetched us when we lost and the check in  went very smooth.  The Studio is very nice and clean. All I can say, I love everything about our stay and Barrossa Valley is very unique.  Thanks a lot to Tom & Kylie"
1710462,9543341,2014-01-02,4876046,Saa,"Lovely self sufficient studio, left with some personal touches. Great location if you want to stay a little bit away from the wineries. Would highly recommend it!"
1710462,9757596,2014-01-08,3371250,Martin,"The Studio in the Vineyard is just beautiful! Very clean, spacious and the most perfect location. I would recommend it to everybody who's going to explore the Barossa Valley!"
1710462,9808018,2014-01-11,11004799,Thomas,"Great little getaway, perfectly situated to visit into the Barossa. Modern kitchen was clean and housed everything needed to cook a light dinner to enjoy with a local wine, looking upon the vines at our doorstep!!!"
1710462,9988829,2014-01-23,19004359,John,"This was the perfect place to stay for a trip to the Barossa! Close to all the wineries, and sitting on a vineyard itself, it was comfortable  and pleasant."
1710462,10065706,2014-01-28,6534569,Aaron,Great litttle bouncing board for our little  3 night trip to the Barossa.    Gave us the opportunity to sample the cullinary delights of the Barossa at our leisure.   The property is located pretty much 15 mins away from anywhere you might want to get to to sample the local produce.   The Studio is privately situated and had everything we needed for 3 nights stay.   Clean and comfortable at a very competitive price.  Would definitely come back.
1710462,10160631,2014-02-03,11466874,Mark&Jiseon,"Great location in the middle of a paddock and vineyard, the hosts have thought of every little detail to make your stay perfect. We got a bunch of nice food and from the area and used the fully equipped kitchen to make an amazing meal. The weather on our stay was over 40 but we were cool in the house thanks to a/c and fans. "
1710462,10410038,2014-02-17,6706172,Tim,"It was a real pleasure to stay in this ""shed"". Very relaxing, quiet and private with wonderful views over the vineyards. Accommodations just as described and very well equipped. Kylie and Tom were great hosts. Highly recommended."
1710462,10488242,2014-02-21,5545570,Bryan,Had a great stay at Kylie and Tom 's place. Just off the highway and convenient to explore the local area. Studio was well appointed and comfortable. Key pickup and communication was smooth and easy. 
1710462,10577525,2014-02-25,5690051,Tom,"Great little place to base yourself for any barossa trip. Surrounded by vineyards and secluded away for privacy, but close to the hosts or townships for any supplies. Good kitchen for cooking any meals. "
1710462,10682848,2014-03-03,6100662,Meagan,"Such wonderful, helpful people. 
Highly recommend :-)"
1710462,10795576,2014-03-08,11500930,Christopher,"Great little spot, right near the main attractions of the Barossa. All amenities were great, and with a nice selection of local magazines."
1710462,10881370,2014-03-11,10783969,Bianca,We loved our stay! The studio was clean and well equipped. Great location and helpful hosts. Amazing winery recommendations too.
1710462,10981800,2014-03-16,9130694,Jane,"Kylie and Tom's studio amongst the vines is a modern and spacious place to stay in. Well situated on the Sturt Highway at the entrance to the Barossa Valley, the studio had everything you would need and more. Kylie was very generous offering us a later checkout even when we hadn't requested it. "
1710462,11115286,2014-03-21,9271107,Erin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Shea Oak Log and Kylie and Tom were great hosts - very helpful when we needed something, but otherwise left us on our own. The studio has a great kitchen for cooking and is just a nice, comfortable space to relax in."
1710462,11463951,2014-04-04,10708879,Lisa,"Kylie and Tom have a beautiful shed in Shea-Oak Log with a comfortable bed and a great kitchen and they are excellent and very helpful hosts. The apartment is located just off Sturt Highway, so it is easily accessible from Adelaide and a perfect spot for exploring the Barossa Valley."
1710462,11536228,2014-04-07,11645618,Carol,"We stayed for two nights in the Shea-Oak vineyard studio in early April and really enjoyed both the rural environment and the Barossa Valley wine. We were on a long trip so it was especially good to have a good bed, quiet, and a good place to cook for ourselves. The interior of the studio is smart and comfortable. Many thanks!"
1710462,11814570,2014-04-15,5037288,Jamie,"We loved our stay at the Shea-Oak studio! Set right amongst the vineyards and only a 10 minute drive to town we were perfectly positioned to get the most out of our stay in Barossa. The unit is actually a 1 bedroom (not a one room studio as I first assumed as an American) and comfortably spacious. The kitchen is fully renovated and equipped with everything you might need to cook a meal at home - important when you are buying wine during the day for evening consumption! The bed was extremely comfortable (loved the heating pad). All in all, great unit and excellent value for the Barossa!"
1710462,11890736,2014-04-18,12975854,Gerry,"A superb place to stay - it's got all the necessities and is situated in a terrifically convenient location. It takes just 45-60 mins to get into the heart of the Barossa (if you take the scenic route, like we did) but if you need to get to Gawler quickly, it's just 15 mins away.

Lovely hosts and a great spot. "
1710462,11976823,2014-04-20,9397048,Linda,"We nestled in Kylie & Tom's studio shed right away. Stayed 2 nights, with a comfortable bed, clean amenities and a convenient drive to the Barossa Valley. Beautiful wine region. Kylie and Tom were friendly and made sure we got to the place ok. Our morning was amazing with the sun shining in the studio with the view of vineyards around us. Will definitely visit again."
1710462,12057023,2014-04-22,4276223,Rónán,Great place. Has everything you need for the perfect stay in the Barossa. 
1710462,12149391,2014-04-24,3871540,Lucy,We had a great time staying in the studio. It is much larger than we expected and we appointed! The accommodation is very comfortable and clean and the hosts were available if needed. The location is near to the highway approaching the Barossa Valley so we enjoyed only having to travel for 10 minutes to get to many of the cellar doors. Thanks for the great stay Kylie and Tom!
1710462,12218976,2014-04-26,14066354,Demetrio,A fantastic few days in the Barossa in this beautiful studio fitted with all the essentials and close to all the best parts of the Barossa. Highly recommend and would stay again. 
1710462,12717157,2014-05-09,13425770,Natasa,"We had an enjoyable 2-night stay at the Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed. Kylie and Tom responded promptly to our emails before we arrived. Directions on the listing were spot-on and check-in/check-out was easy. The studio shed was clean and spacious. The kitchen was well-appointed which was great for dining in. Good supply of tea, coffee, milk and cereal. We loved being so close to the vines. A fabulous base to explore the wineries in the Barossa Valley!"
1710462,13248626,2014-05-23,13275565,Kriz,"This accommodation was well above expectations - the picture was very accurate of the clean,well designed accommodation"
1710462,14083250,2014-06-11,14529878,Rebekah,"We absolutely loved our stay. The cabin was in a central position in the Barossa and it was exceptionally clean. 
 
Kylie and Tom were great hosts. We would definitely go back. "
1710462,14305134,2014-06-16,9274232,Thoa,"We loved staying at Kylie and Tom's converted shed - great location, all the modern amenities, cozy and perfect for all our needs. They were gracious and thoughtful and had the place warmed up for us by the time we arrived as we walked in on a very stormy day. Looked forward to getting back every night after a full day of local sightseeing and wine tasting. Thanks again Kylie and Tom!"
1710462,14635627,2014-06-23,9155378,Han,"Amazing place! It was so beautiful, so cozy, but with all the amenities. Kylie had the heating turned on ready for our arrival, and Tom - our hero - met us with his tractor to drag us out of a bog - serious service!! It was such a cute place, and was an easy drive to the wineries. "
1710462,15596680,2014-07-12,14535456,Col,"Kylie and Tom provide private and comfortable accomodation with great facilities. We found the Shed to be a perfect launching pad into the Barossa and Kylie had the Air con on so even though outside was 5 degrees we immediately felt cosy! 
Facilities were great - comfy bed with chocolate supplied! and a choice of teas and coffees!
Would highly recommend The Shed to all - in fact I have already told half a dozen of my friends - reasonable rates and excellent hosts!"
1710462,15848847,2014-07-16,3239808,Belinda,"What a great experience.  It would have to be the cleanest and best equipped air bnb I have stayed in.  Kylie and Tom were great to deal with and very accommodating.  A great gateway to the Barossa Wineries.  I can highly recommend, and I will be back. "
1710462,15987578,2014-07-19,3858886,Angela,"A clean, cosy and convenient place to stay while exploring the Barossa. We did not meet Kylie and Tom as you are able to come and go and enjoy the space privately. But a little schnauzer did come say hello. It is great value when compared to the other available accommodation in the area, equipped with a very handy kitchen and a very comfortable and beautifully presented bed. The hosts left a great list of vineyard recommendations all of which we loved visiting. "
1710462,16986046,2014-08-05,16640283,Josie,"Wonderful accommodation on a beautiful little vineyard, in a great location to visit the Barossa Vineyards"

1710462,18152390,2014-08-22,14839062,Carlene & Tony,"We had a wonderful stay In the Barossa.  The converted shed is really cozy, had everything we needed, comfy and warm bed.  It was a lovely retreat whilst exploring the Barossa.  Was a little noise from traffic in the morning but only as a light sleeper would notice.  Great accommodation, thanks Tom and Kylie for having us and porridge which I hadn't had in years - delicious! "
1710462,18317893,2014-08-25,17585817,Laura,"The property was exactly what we needed for touring the Barossa, the pictures fairly represent what you get, it was clean and well equipped.  The shower was excellent, bed was good and the electric blanket was a godsend on the cold spring nights.  It is worth noting however that there is road noise 24/7 so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  Overall excellent value for money and very well situated."
1710462,20491348,2014-09-30,7337390,Robert,The Studio was a great base for exploring the Barossa. It is really well equipped and very comfortable and while nothing is within walking distance all of the main centres are within a short drive. We did not meet Kylie and Tom but they were great with communications including arrival instructions.
1710462,20740559,2014-10-05,13928153,Pat And Rob,Perfect in every way!    Wonderful place.

1710462,21505291,2014-10-19,16554299,Jillana,"We never met our host, but everything was waiting for us when we arrived in Barossa.  The place was FANTASTIC, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and location.  This property is a gem!  The only thing we wanted for was wi-fi, which was found in local coffee houses nearby."
1710462,21664969,2014-10-21,16267536,Nadia,"We had a great stay at Kylie and Tom's. Spacious and modern accommodation, great location- great for a weekend exploring the Barossa! Kylie and Tom were communicative and friendly. Definitely recommend!  "
1710462,22015819,2014-10-28,7045592,Shelley,"Kylie and Tom's Shea-Oak Vineyard Studio was very clean and well presented. It was well priced and in a good location about 15 minutes drive from most of the vineyards and nearby towns. Kylie and Tom were helpful hosts. When we needed to contact them they were available. They left us welcoming chocolate biscuits, as well as tea, coffee and some milk. The studio was well priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on the edge of the Barossa Valley."
1710462,22288796,2014-11-03,15064936,Michael,Cosy and comfortable place to stay close to the Barossa. Close to the Sturt Hwy for easy drives to the main wineries.
1710462,22600268,2014-11-10,8079668,Monique,"The place was lovely, it had everything we needed and then some. The kitchen was so well stocked with cooking utensils it was so easy to cook without having to make any compromises. The bed is so comfy too. Overall it's a great little place to stay out of the way but still with great access to the central towns of the Barossa Valley. The couple of times we needed to speak to Kylie she was very friendly and helpful. We would love to stay there again & recommend it to everyone."
1710462,22902979,2014-11-17,567406,Sarah,Amazing place! Literally right on a vineyard with everything you could want in an accommodation. A must stay for your Barossa trip. We'll be back.
1710462,23014819,2014-11-20,23198083,Bronwyn,"Accurate description. Hosts always friendly and available if needed but happy to let us keep to ourselves. Good communication. Loved the locality, spacious quarters, very clean, comfortable, well equipped and pleasant decor. Set back from the road but fairly busy truck route-not too noisy but noticeable. Easy drive to Barossa Valley attractions, pleasant drive to Adelaide area, Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley."
1710462,23421516,2014-12-01,12947304,Aaron," Our hosts Kylie and Tom were keen, friendly and helpful communicators and at the same time allowed us privacy during our stay. Kylie and Tom's set up at Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio is comfortable, neat and tidy, with nice quality furniture and fittings throughout and are all appreciated after a hard day's exploring. In particular, the kitchen is well-equipped and the bedroom furniture appears new. The bed is very comfortable. It is also well-situated as a base to explore the nearby wine regions. Highly recommended accommodation."
1710462,23936393,2014-12-15,2942799,Sandra,"We had a wonderful time staying at Shea-Oak Log vineyard studio.   The studio was more than the pictures : with chocolates on our pillows, extra bedding for our kids, strong shower with hot water, fully equipped kitchen with wine glasses, organized cutlery and cooking utensils, including cable TV.  There was even an electric blanket for us, little details but so thoughtful for guests.   The location is perfect to drive up to Adelaide Hills and explore Barossa Valley on a daily basis.  Short drives and easy access to come home every day.  A perfect retreat with all the comforts of a studio."
1710462,24130741,2014-12-21,16645757,Vaurian,"Beautifully appointed studio, cosy and comfortable with everything you need for a stay in the Barossa. About 15 minutes to Nuriootpa and a few more to Tanunda and Angaston which is great for day trips to winery's but maybe a little far if you want to go in for dinner, we only went out 1 night in 3.
Kylie and Tom live in a fabulous part of Australi"
1710462,24599377,2014-12-31,14404888,Sonny,"Our stay at Kylie and Tom's studio shed was very pleasant and comfortable. The hosts were flexible and accommodating in arrival & departure times. Everything just went very smooth and seamless. The kitchen is fully equipped and has cutlery, pots & pans to cook. The bathroom comes with towels. It was a perfect base to explore Barossa! Highly recommended."
1710462,25016945,2015-01-05,15239363,Simon,"'The Shed' was a fantastic spot for our stay, surrounded by vines with no-one around other than Kylie and Tom's home about 500m away, this really did feel like our very own quiet slice of the Barossa. The studio had everything we needed including aircon which Kylie switched on for us before our arrival (it was very warm on the two days we were there 40+). Although we had very little contact with Kylie and Tom they left us with everything we needed, including breakfast. A brilliant place to stay for any couple's Barossa experience!"
1710462,25467753,2015-01-17,23759431,Deirdre,"We stayed at Shea-Oak whilst exploring the Barossa. It was a great location, away from the hustle & bustle but close enough to enjoy everything. The house was clean, relaxing, spacious & had everything we needed. It was a great place to stay. "
1710462,25559127,2015-01-19,25440952,Kenneth,"Awesome place and not too far from where all the action is. Tom was awesome and personally brought us some brand new wine glasses when there was only 1 there. 
Cute and cozy place. Nice and convenient "
1710462,25666032,2015-01-22,8888331,Jacqui,Kylie and Tom left us to our own devices which was convenient for us. They were available by telephone and made sure we knew that they were approachable. We had to call them when we were having issues with the oven and Kylie came quickly to the rescue! We had an excellent weekend and felt like the Studio Shed was our little home for the short time we had there. 
1710462,25858239,2015-01-27,20840948,Kate,We loved our stay at the studio! Kylie and Tom where so lovely and not only did we feel at home we had everything we could possibly need! A little gem that we would highly recommend! 
1710462,26054531,2015-02-02,25040051,Mitchell,"Everything was perfect from the chocolates on the pillows to the full stocked kitchen and even a wine delivery from your daughter Belle!! (Great wine by the way)

A great way to see the Barossa and we will recommend the studio to all of our friends.
 
Thank you for an amazing trip.
 
Kind Regards
A very happy customer,
Mitch"
1710462,26589063,2015-02-16,16399411,Johan,"We had a great stay over the Valentines Day weekend. Kylie&Tom were a pleasure to communicate with pleasure and left us to our own devices. The Barossa Valley townships were easily accessible and the apartment was modern, clean and stocked with basics. It was 40 degrees outside but between two air conditioners and a fan, it was fine. Some reviews talk of truck noice from the highway 100m away but I'm a light sleeper and had no troubles at all. Would stay again!!"
1710462,27144564,2015-02-26,8677799,Kate,"Kylie and Tom were very prompt in responding to our requests and even worked out with us to stay an extra night in their gorgeous studio (in the midst of their grapevines).  They have a wonderful eye for design and detail, with nothing was left out that you could need - a range of great teas, and even a couple of buttons in case you lose yours!  We stayed for 3 nights and were glad we did.  The location is perfect for wine tasting throughout the Barossa Valley - and close enough to grocery stores and other amenities.  

A great respite at the end of the day!"
1710462,27321864,2015-03-02,13015952,Scott,We were very happy with our stay at Shea-Oak Log. It was not necessary for us to have face to face contact with Kylie and Tom but we had their contact details if there were any issues. The photos and description are exactly what we found and the details provided prior to our arrival on how to get there and get in etc were very easy to follow. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay!
1710462,27638408,2015-03-09,14580306,Kelly,"The house was really easy to find and in a really nice spot. It was closer to the main highway than I first thought, but that did make exploring the area really lovely. The house was really well decorated and nice and cosy. Perfect for a couple of days. "
1710462,28238198,2015-03-20,9732202,Mia And Joseph,Loved every minute of it. Easy to find situated amongst beautiful vineries. Went for a walk. Very close to all the Barossa has to offer. Great little getaway from Adelaide.
1710462,28488038,2015-03-24,8805125,Jie,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Studio. The Studio was very equipped and has everything we could possibly need. The place is bright, spacious and spotless. I would highly recommend anyone who is planning to visit Barrosa to stay at this studio. The place is perfect for a weekend away or staying for longer. "
1710462,29051945,2015-04-03,26333353,Kimberley,"Had a lovely stay at Shea Oak, easily accessible to the Barossa which was lots of fun. Enjoyed staying amongst the vines. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!"
1710462,29384374,2015-04-07,15578359,Alicia,"they provided very easy instructions, the studio was fully stocked, quick access to highway. There was lots of information on local wineries provided. 
Didn't meet Kylie or Tom but knew they were available if needed. 

costs about $50 to catch a cab to the nearest town Tanunda

highway could be a little loud BUT it's not a busy highway and it probably only seems loud because the countryside is so quiet! 

comfy bed and HEAPS of pillows."
1710462,29577713,2015-04-09,25770204,Kelly,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Studio. The location couldn't be anymore convenient to where we wanted to be in the Barossa. Our hosts had included all the comforts that we would need and made it ideal for making breakfasts easy with their lovely additions in the morning (jams, porridge, coffee, tea). 
Will be recommending to any friends who are travelling that way! "
1710462,30020137,2015-04-16,7813972,Brad,The studio was a nice place to see the Barossa. It had everything that we needed and was about 15 minutes from shops of Tanunda. We enjoyed a great wine tour from mark at Barossa cruisin'.
1710462,30185077,2015-04-19,7473198,Kristina,"Kylie and Tom's vineyard shed is the perfect place for a Barossa getaway! Cosy and beautifully modern, with all the comforts and facilities that you could need to relax. Lovely breakfast goodies put out for us, fresh towels and immaculately clean.
The vineyard setting is great, and very easy to find off the main highway. Great brochures and recommendations of what to do and see in the Barossa Valley - all within a 30 minute drive from the Studio shed.
Thank you for a wonderful stay. Will be back!"
1710462,30392816,2015-04-21,28903316,Palash,"The accommodation was neat and clean - everything we expected. Tom and Kylie were superb with their communication. I could see their house - what seemed like 500 metres away - however, the unit we booked was secluded and we felt like we had the vines to ourselves. We dined at Hentley Farm - which was a $40 cab fare. We were able to order pizza delivery for dinner (as we couldn't drive upon our return) - so the shack itself is serviced by everything that is needed. I'd recommend it. Big comfy bed. Tea and breakfast provisions. The barossa on your door step - excellent place to stay and well priced."
1710462,30778334,2015-04-27,15334505,Madeleine,"I did not get to meet the hosts personally, but the place was set up perfectly for us. We arrived late, and they left the lights and heats on for us. It was a great base for us exploring the Barossa. i especially enjoyed the electric blankets and shower!"
1710462,31318859,2015-05-04,29431306,James,"Thank you Kylie & Tom! What a wonderful place you have in the Barossa! Just perfect for a weekend getaway, removed from town but only a short distance to everything you need in the area! Great unique accommodation, hosts & views. "
1710462,32251903,2015-05-16,5216646,Laura,"The studio shed was perfect for our short stay in the Barossa! Easy drive to everything, and the studio itself was very spacious and comfortable. I have already recommended it to friends for their Barossa trips!!"
1710462,32611034,2015-05-19,7295651,Andrea,"To describe that place in one word... WOW... But if you like awesome is fine (Website hidden by Airbnb) a bit isolate, so you need the car, but that's a plus if you are looking for a week end for you and your family/lover. If your arrival is during twilight you will find the light that drives you.. Open the door and you will see how the shed has been set-up for you... You feel like at home... My suggestion is to take with you everything you might need:food and good wine ,from Barossa,of course. You will find all the information to visit Barossa and if you might need something more, text them and they will let you know whatever you after!
Absolutely recommend!!"
1710462,32886614,2015-05-23,25921141,Sophie,"We had a great 2 nights stay in this lovely apartment on the vineyard. Very peaceful and a great spot to explore the Barossa from. Very comfortable and would definitely recommend it to friends and family. 
Thanks Kylie and Tom"
1710462,33228725,2015-05-26,2188730,Thomas,"Clean, comfortable and modern self contained place ten minutes from tanunda. Kylie & tom were lovely hosts and made our stay easy and were even able to accommodate our pug Giuseppe. Being surrounded by all the vines on an operational vineyard was a great way to experience the Barossa. Highly recommended!"
1710462,34538554,2015-06-09,1475985,Kaitlin,We loved staying here. A perfect place to base yourself in the Barossa. I have already recommended it to many friends.
1710462,35243826,2015-06-16,163922,Benedict,Kylie and Tom were great hosts. The place was well setup and made a good base camp to explore the Barossa. We felt very welcome (thanks for providing an infant cot!) and definitely recommend staying here.

1710462,37162918,2015-07-05,7123914,Sonya,"My husband and I really loved our stay at The Studio, it was beautifully laid out and so comfortable. We also loved the horse that came to greet is each morning and night when we returned from a day out. It took us 15-20 minutes to drive wherever we wanted to go in the Barossa Valley and we left feeling totally refreshed. We also loved being able to cook after a few nights on the road."
1710462,38128568,2015-07-13,33636911,Rick,"Cute pleasant place, bed is warm and comfortable and the hot water runs freely.  Hosts were communicative throughout: thanks."

1710462,40898966,2015-08-03,10955856,Ali,"She-oak Studio was a gorgeous place to stay for our Barossa weekend. A cosy cottage with all the mod cons we needed. Kylie and Tom made sure we were warm and comfy despite out late (and cold!)evening arrival; lights and heater were on for us, and brekkie goodies were left for us too.
Delighted by the horse in the paddock adjacent the studio, who was keen for a pat and to say hello! 
Thanks guys!"
1710462,42173532,2015-08-11,36150022,Jill,"What a fantastic experience-Tom and Kylie were utterly lovely to deal with from go-to-woah, nothing was too much trouble. The property was perfect - extremely clean, very affordable, well-stocked with everything we might need and then some, private, plus perfectly located for exploring the beautiful Barossa. We had an absolute blast during our stay, and would highly recommend this home away from home and it's wonderful hosts. Was lovely to meet Vinnie the pony too "
1710462,46036094,2015-09-07,42332381,Laura,We absolutely adored this property! It's in the perfect location to explore the Barossa and was very much a home away from home! Kylie and Tom had thought of all the little details to make our stay comfortable and the views on their property are stunning! 
1710462,47036427,2015-09-15,11087307,Quynh,"If you want privacy and a home away from home, this is where you should stay in the Barossa. With a baby, we were provided with a cot and having a full kitchen allowed us to stay in at night and make dinner. The sunrise every morning was spectacular. "
1710462,47987171,2015-09-22,31636865,Rosmaya,The studio is even lovelier than the pictures. We really enjoyed the stay albeit it's only one night. It's serene and peaceful and yet close to key attractions and wineries. You can even view sunset from the lounge. Kylie and Tom were very kind to allow us to stay for one night only and lots of care had been put in to welcome us. We also had a little surprise on our pillows - individual Tim Tam ;-) and we loved watching your friendly pony. The only regret was we wished we could stay longer. We highly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks.
1710462,49003576,2015-09-30,10859271,Jill,"We had a terrific stay at Kylie & Tom's studio at Shea Oak Log. It was very clean, comfortable and stylish. As we stayed there for 3 nights, we appreciated the full kitchen which was very well equipped and a nice touch with the De Longhi machine and pods. The bed was very comfortable and it was a great base to explore the Barossa. "
1710462,49310500,2015-10-03,15829956,James,Great holiday studio. It was even better than the photos and made the perfect base for a barossa trip. The hosts Kylie and Tom were very welcoming although not obtrusive at all.

1710462,52064619,2015-10-26,10496185,Rose,"What a gem in the middle of the Barossa Valley! Only a short drive the vineyards and local restaurants and shops. Kylie and Tom have thought of everything one might need for a stay in the Barossa (i.e. comfortable bed, maps of the Barossa, coffee machine, fully equipped kitchen, winery recommendations, etc). It was lovely to stay on a vineyard (right outside the door), and still have the privacy of a hotel. Highly recommend! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Thank you Kylie and Tom for making our first trip to the Barossa a memorable one."
1710462,52422088,2015-10-29,43821960,Tony,"The Studio was charming and quite off the beaten track, so to speak.  We enjoyed our time there and studio was very well stocked with the essentials.  Good location for pick up for a Barossa wine tour."
1710462,54087539,2015-11-16,31576947,Michael,"Kylie and Tom wrote a personal note to us, very thoughtful and appreciated. Great place, with all the conveniences you could want and close to food, and wineries. You go to the Barossa to see vines and drink wines, you don't have to go anywhere to see the vines they are right out the front door! "
1710462,54840854,2015-11-25,22910790,Danielle,"Thank you Kylie and Tom, we loved our stay! Great accommodation, very comfortable and good location to all the surrounding wineries. "

It was great to be in a private cabin next to the vineyard all on our own. The welcome chocolates on the pillows was a lovely touch "
1710462,60603052,2016-01-25,42826520,Rohan,Kylie and Tom are perfect hosts. The studio was very clean and well equipped with everything you would ever need.  We will certainly recommend their studio to visitors to the Barossa.
1710462,61191424,2016-02-01,53263783,Jack,"The Shea-oak log shed studio was an incredibly quaint and lovely experience. We stayed for three nights and were blown away by the fact that the studio seemed to have everything that we could possibly need. The kitchen was fully equipped with cooking utensils and condiments which was ideal for us. The bedroom was especially comfortable and made for some extremely good nights sleep. 
Kylie and Tom made an effort to not interrupt our experience but we're always just one message away if we needed any assistance. I would highly recommend this accommodation to anyone intending to head to the Barossa area."

1710462,64876688,2016-03-08,59289798,Richard,"Absolutly spectacular! Close to the Sturt Hwy, so most of the vinyards are not that far away. Great views of country scapes & beautiful sunsets as well. Would really reccomend this as a base for those vinyard visits. Self contained so you can cook your own meals as well! Great place, hope to stay there again!"

1710462,71076108,2016-04-23,62693108,Harriet,"Shea-Oak Log was just gorgeous! As soon as we walked in we felt right at home, with all the home comforts that one could ever need. The kitchen had lots of amenities, and the hot water promised lovely hot showers morning and night. The chocolates on our pillow were just the loveliest touch, and their terribly cute pony, Red, would greet us everyday as he stayed in a nearby paddock. The location was very convenient, as it's just a short drive to endless wineries and only about 10 minutes to local shops/restaurants.

Hosts Kylie and Tom have really thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible.  The living room warms up quickly and the attention to detail is evident.

The homely warmth feeling this place had was incredible. I travelled alone to go to a Mcleods Daughters lunch at Kingford Homestead and this was so central it was perfect only a very short drive to everywhere relevant to Mcleods Daughters. 
Kylie and Tom went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and also helped me out of the mud when I found myself bogged! 
This B&B played a huge part in why my trip to SA was so magical. 
It had everything I needed and so much more. 
Two heaters to keep you cosy all cooking appliances and lots of hot water! 
Don't think twice about booking this B&B you will not regret it. 
It is simply perfect! "

1710462,84927249,2016-07-09,19419195,Luella,"Perfect Barossa Getaway. The accommodation was cosy, clean and located in the gateway to the Barossa wineries. We were able to cook our dinners and relax in the comfortable renovated shed. The animals were a nice touch too. "

1710462,87741525,2016-07-21,17559157,David,"Our stay at shea-oak log was amazing. For the price, we couldn't have expected anything more. It was a cosy and well furnished apartment in a great location close to the beautiful Barossa valley cellar doors. Kylie and Tom were really helpful and friendly. Our weekend was made even more special when we got engaged at hentley farm. Will highly recommend this place to our friends. Chelsea and Dave."

The shed is very well appointed with everything from coffee pods to cling wrap. Electric blankets were a big positive on a winter's night as well. Huge thanks to Kylie and Tom for making our stay smooth and comfortable."

The location was perfect, accessible to the north and south of the Barossa and all it has to offer. We were perfectly warm, cosy and comfortable, a home away from home. Our grandchildren loved the animals. Kylie was very helpful with directions and maintained great communication before our trip. Thank you Kylie and Tom. We hope to stay again. Best wishes, Maree and Aiden"

1710462,97731809,2016-08-28,85978573,Tom,"Kylie and Tom provided excellent pre-arrival communication. Instructions to find and enter the property were very concise. Great location with only a short drive to town centres and popular destinations around the Barossa. Gorgeous place nestled among the vineyards, highly recommend the sunset over the adjacent field. Thanks for having us! "

1710462,98578442,2016-08-31,22172932,Jason,We had a wonderful stay at Kylie and Tom's place in the Barossa Valley. The self contained unit is in the perfect location to explore all the wineries and it has all the amenities you could possibly need.

1710462,101723901,2016-09-14,57236730,Chloe,"We loved our stay at the Studio and enjoyed our daily greetings from the friendly furry/wooly neighbours. The little personal touches (lights on for late arrival, good coffee, shampoo & conditioner) made us feel very welcome. It has a beautiful cosy feel while being nice and spacious! All in all, a great place to stay and explore a beautiful part of the world! "
1710462,102649587,2016-09-18,34407902,Penny,"Kylie sent us great directions to their wonderful accommodation and on opening the door we were very happy and surprised at just how lovely, cosy and clean the place was. We looked forward to coming back each day knowing how relaxing and quiet it was (even though it was reasonably close to the highway). You definitely need a car to stay here. I highly recommend Kylie and Tom's Shea-Oak Log and would definitely stay again. One of the better ones!"

We enjoyed having the animals come down to our end of the paddock for a feed of carrots. "
1710462,105204030,2016-09-30,91482404,Donna,Good location.  - 15-20 min drive from the bigger wineries and Barossa Valley Towns.  Very private accommodation with everything we needed.  Being so close to the Hwy was convenient if you're not adverse to associated road noise at night.  Kylie and Tom were great hosts.
1710462,105732037,2016-10-02,82598987,John,"A great place amongst the vineyards, private, fully equiped and a great mattress. "

1710462,106914409,2016-10-08,30567129,Mathew,"Kylie and Tom were great hosts. Communication was excellent. We had to get picked up for a wine tour prior to checking in to their accomodation and they were very flexible with allowing us to leave our car on site. The facilities were everything we needed with some helpful information to help us navigate our way around the Barossa region. Location was nice and removed from the main parts of town but only a short car trip away. Also lovely to meet the pony and sheep in the paddock close by. Thanks again Kylie and Tom.

Cheers Mat and Hannah"
1710462,107514504,2016-10-10,62210124,Lisa,"Loved our relaxing couple of days here, great to have a full kitchen for cooking and close enough to all of the places we wanted to visit. Lovely and private space, no complaints at all!"

We loved the little touches such as chocolates on our pillow, tea and coffee supplies and some toiletries available to use. We can't wait to recommend your place to others!"

1710462,111587490,2016-10-31,6550274,Helen,"Stayed at Kylie and Toms studio over cup weekend, had a lovely time, it was a good location to get to winery's. Really enjoyed feeding the animals. The studio was really cute and had everything you need for a comfortable stay. Would love to return in the future."
1710462,112067857,2016-11-03,11348355,Melina,The Shed was a lovely place to base ourselves for exploring the Barossa and surrounds. It had everything we needed and the pets were friendly. Thanks Kylie and Tom.
1710462,113430324,2016-11-12,3623468,Amy,"The studio was the perfect place to base ourselves for visiting the Barossa and extremely comfy. The bedroom has a blackout blind and the bed is enormous so we slept far longer than we'd planned to! It's a very quiet location and the windows overlook fields so you feel very remote, which we loved. It's so picturesque!

The studio had everything we needed for our stay, including an iron for those who, like me, always end up with screwed up clothes in the suitcase!

I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting the area and are looking for a peaceful, relaxing stay. Thank you Kylie and Tom :)"
1710462,114962305,2016-11-20,31772126,Cassandra,"My partner and I stayed at Kylie and Tom's place over the weekend for A Day on the Green. These guys were super friendly and helpful, quickly responding to my questions via the AirBnB app. Furthermore, the actual 'converted shed' is an absolute delight; once you're inside it feels like a small apartment, except you have the gorgeous backdrop of their property! A comfortable bed, clean and updated kitchen, and convenient parking were all extra pluses. An outstanding, 5/5 stay in the Barossa. Thanks so much, both of you!"
1710462,115099688,2016-11-21,23629349,James,"Great unique spot...loads of character and was perfect for our short stay in the Barossa.  Kylie and Tom were very helpful, allowing us to stay at very short notice."
1710462,116087276,2016-11-27,11501087,Michael And Alexandra,"The Studio is situated about 10 minutes by car to a range of excellent vineyards.  Kylie and Tom have created a self contained studio, perfect for those wishing to wind down quietly after a busy day being a tourist.  It is so private in fact we never even met our hosts but they were only a phone call away had we needed to make contact.

The Studio has a full kitchen should you wish to cook. 

Check in and out was really simple - thank you. 

Great value for money!"
1710462,120021693,2016-12-07,15332350,Ros,We loved our stay at the Studio in She Oak Log! It was easy to find with the clearly communicated directions given to us by Kylie and Tom. It was a lovely base to explore the Barossa and come 'home' to at the end of the day.
1710462,120491572,2016-12-10,36078685,James,Our stay was comfortable.
1710462,122966792,2016-12-26,32223614,Jitima,"We enjoyed our time there. The host really took effort to ensure that we arrived safely and comfortable. Everything is good and well equipped.  
Overall, this is a very good place and would be perfect if you spend a few days in the area. "

An unique experience to have . :)
Kylie is a great host."
1710462,123803113,2016-12-30,49383160,Olga,"Whilst the property is located a little further from the main Barossa towns of Tanunda or Angaston, it's very easy to get around, with most places being within 10 mins drive.  It's very close to Gawler, a very pleasant historical town that we really enjoyed.  The cottage has everything one needs for a comfortable stay.  As expected, we paid a little bit of a premium for staying during the Christmas/New Years time.  However, the non-peak rates seem to be an excellent value.  Would definitely consider staying there again. "
1710462,125075530,2017-01-03,34611462,Yvonne,"Instructions to the shed were clear and easy to get to. The space was cosy and comfortable. The noise from the road did not bother us. Although we did not meet Kylie and Tom, communication was very easy and friendly! Great value for money. We would stay there again. "

1710462,127621908,2017-01-19,7885092,Michele,"Unique and comfortable and quiet even though it not far from the highway, very good sound proof installation. Very amazed with the interior when the outside looks like a shed but the he interior is homely and welcoming."
1710462,128451343,2017-01-24,41509670,Laura,Perfectly located for exploring all the Barossa has to offer! Great place to stay with everything you will need! Loved the Nespresso machine! 
1710462,128840786,2017-01-27,109952006,John,"This is an ideal place to stay when visiting people in Gawler. A nice quite retreat 10 minutes away from Gawler itself to avoid the traffic congestion Gawler seems to suffer from but close enough to be handy for meals etc. Very nice accommodation indeed with everything a traveler could want and more.  This was a great find I will happily stay again and recommend it to freinds.
Cheers John "
1710462,129715592,2017-02-01,96740492,Nina,"Fabulous place so long as one of you will drive after wine tasting or take a tour!! So peaceful, so relaxing & such a great place with all the little creature comforts thought of "

1710462,135364385,2017-03-04,23904530,Joanna And Lachlan,"The Studio is gorgeous, comfortable and well located near many of the wineries. We felt right at home but were also in awe of the beautiful location and friendly animals. We were so relaxed and can't wait to come back--would highly recommend! "
1710462,136454698,2017-03-10,72465910,Elaine,"My husband and i stayed in shea oak studio in Feb 2017. The initial thing we noticed was that it wasn't a working vineyard, which we were hoping for as we come from an area in Tasmania with Vineyards all around us, and we knew it was getting close for the Barossa for their harvesting. But the Vineyard is quit rundown. The Studio on first impression was lovley, very clean, and had a few condiments in the fridge, tea , coffee, and a coffee making machine. Surprisingly quiet when the doors were shut, as it is close to the highway, but had not much impact on our stay. Nice touch with chocolates on our bed pillows. Need to be a bit careful in the bathroom when you get out of shower, as the tiles are very slippery, and as the shower door doesn't shut properly, it lets water out on the floor. You cant put the shower rug close to the door as the shower door will not open .  But other than that our stay was quit enjoyable. If we are every back in the Barossa, we would probably be staying in Tanunda, so we are close to restaurants and shops, as it was a little annoying that we has to drive to dinner , but couldn't have a few nice wines together due to driving back to the studio. But is that doesn't bother you, then this is a lovely place to stay, and fantastic value. "
1710462,136662356,2017-03-11,10490141,Megan,We loved our stay at Kylie and Tom's place! Great kitchen that we used to cook dinner with groceries from a nearby store. Perfect stay for our little family!
1710462,137013426,2017-03-12,6311453,Amy,"What a perfect spot to stay amongst the vines in the beautiful Barossa. The perfect size for two people, the converted shed is comfortable and cozy. Although Kylie and Tom weren't there when we visited, Kylie was in touch before our arrival and very easy to contact to organise check in. 
If ever we find ourselves back in the Barossa we will be sure to stay again. Thanks again !! "
1710462,138478726,2017-03-19,12748562,Caitlin,"Great apartment, very clean but not located centrally to wineries otherwise it was good. "

1710462,140115279,2017-03-27,120605188,Stela,"Great little studio perfect for a couple to stay very private and close to barossa.

We would stay there again!"

1710462,144928429,2017-04-16,4770762,Eleanor,"Kylie and Tom's studio was a wonderful place to spend a long weekend. It has an extremely well equipped kitchen which was great as we cooked in every night. The open plan kitchen and living was a great space; lovely and bright during the day, and cosy at night. Check in and out was super easy. The location was lovely, there was a little bit of road noise, but nothing to be worried about. It was very easy to reach nearby towns in the Barossa.
Overall it was a great place and we would thoroughly recommend!  "
1710462,145763439,2017-04-19,67184434,Tim,"Great value accommodation near the Barossa region.
Lovely little studio to just relax in between checking out the wineries and restaurants of the region."
1710462,146837787,2017-04-23,116187747,Hannah,"Had everything we needed for a few nights in the Barossa. Was easy to drive to all the towns from here- was a tiny further out from what we expected but we are new to the Barossa and it was clear in the description. 
Overall exactly what we needed, there was a bit of noise from the highway so if your a light sleeper I'd say bring ear plugs - my husband had no trouble at all though! Barossa is beautiful and well worth a visit!"
1710462,148078547,2017-04-30,29556400,William,Comfy and cozy base from which to explore the Baross
1710462,151236354,2017-05-11,70098691,Alan,"We stayed for a week in early May at Kylie and Tom's studio unit. It is just off the main highway, around half way between Gawler and the main Barossa towns such as Tanunda, Nuriootpa and Angaston and just on the edge of the Barossa Valley. By car , the main areas of interest are still very accessible, being around 10-15 min drive away on very good roads. The unit itself was excellent, especially well set up for self catering (which is what we wanted). The accommodation was very comfortable and good value. We would definitely use this unit again if we were back in the Barossa."
1710462,151671995,2017-05-13,47531335,Jonas,"This cottage was a fantastic base for exploring the Barossa Valley.  We had a hassle free stay with check-in, check-out being straight forward.  Only a 10 minute drive to Gawler for all our necessities."
1710462,154517932,2017-05-25,92861100,Benjamin,"Spent a beautiful three nights in the secluded shea oak log, only a 15 min drive to tanunda and a truly beautiful spot to visit. The space was great and had everything you needed. There was no wifi, but phone reception was great so it didn't matter."
1710462,154957193,2017-05-26,39788700,Kathryn,Loved it. Everything we needed.   Close to McLeod Country. Great place to come back to and relax. I would stay again and re recommend to others 
1710462,155266693,2017-05-28,101803340,Monica,Beautiful well-equipped cottage with lots of extras such as plush linen and travel tips of the area. Can highly recommend it. 
1710462,159872060,2017-06-12,51096850,Sarah,Quiet and private space that's still close to the region's attractions.  This was a perfect base to explore the Barossa. 
1710462,161407310,2017-06-18,1310075,Georgina,"Very comfortable and warm - even though it was freezing outside. :)
Would stay here again!"
1710462,164037077,2017-06-26,6849761,Sarah & Bernard,"What an amazing bungalow! 
We had such an wonderful stay at Kylie and Tom's converted shed. It had absolutely everything we needed. They have done a fantastic job at setting up the place fully equipped with everything you'd need for a weekend away. The kitchen was perfect for cooking in, comfortable bed and a spacious living area. 
We were a bit concerned about the location before arriving, however if you have a car, it's no issue at all! Very easy to drive to wineries. Just keep in mind, if you were to get a cab to any of the wineries, it will cost at least $80 return for only a 10 minute drive down the road! 
Some reviews suggested a lot of road noice. This was not an issue for us at all and slept peacefully every night. 
We will definitely be returning to Shea-Oak Log! 
"
1710462,165753174,2017-07-02,6951044,Katia,"Kylie & Tom's place was fabulous - secluded and quiet, but only a short drive from the nearest towns and the best of the Barossa. The unit was clean, spacious and modern, which is to say extremely comfortable - we could have stayed for a week! Absolutely loved it. "
1710462,166907651,2017-07-05,101591125,Sian,"The studio is a beautiful retreat! It was quiet and private, a perfect home away from home. With only a 15 minute drive to basically everything Barossa it was a great base to explore and warm and cozy to return to for the night in the middle of winter. Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job making it immaculate and throughly thought of everything you could need. Definitely recommended!"
1710462,167195693,2017-07-06,7278813,Margie,"Kylie and Tom are excellent hosts and the studio is a beautifully furnished and equipped, private haven. Although it is located quite close to the highway we found that the road noise was not a problem once we were inside the studio. and soon the revegetation planting will be tall enough to muffle it even more. We enjoyed everything about our stay and would highly recommend it."
1710462,168141518,2017-07-09,3582125,John,"Kylie & Tom's place was a great base for us during our stay.  It has everything you'll need, Kylie and Tom are easy to get in touch with and made the whole experience really easy.

Would highly recommend! "

Thank you for fantastic studio accomodation !"
1710462,172110608,2017-07-20,15789620,Harvey,Well priced for a very comfortable and well supplied apartment. By car it's not too far to Gawler and the Barossa. We especially enjoyed cycling the Barossa Bike Trail- this time from Gawler to Tanunda - a dedicated bitumen track through the beautiful Barossa Valley  (once you've overcome the challenge of finding where it starts).
1710462,173180749,2017-07-23,6737753,Beth,"This was one of the best equipped airbnbs we've ever stayed in! Kitchen had everything we needed to make some tasty meals with produce we bought from the region. Can't recommend enough, very close to all the Barossa has to offer. We didn't meet the hosts but they were very clearly there for us if we needed anything (provided us with a host of phone numbers if necessary). Thanks for a positive experience!"
1710462,175833324,2017-07-30,42006095,Tory,Absolute bliss! We loved our stay at Shea-Oak! Thank you Kylie and Tom!
1710462,177175010,2017-08-02,58545370,Jane,Lovely and comfortable Airbnb place! Friendly host. Highly recommended.
1710462,178164626,2017-08-05,6312338,Emily,"Kylie and Tom are great hosts! They were super communicative with our check-in and directions, gave us a couple of tips (maps and brochures) and even left a couple lights on for us to find the place as we arrived quite late (11pm). 
The place itself has a big and spacious living room, fully equipped kitchen and a super cosy bedroom with the most comfortable bed for relaxing after a day of exploring the Barossa. We only wished we stayed longer!"
1710462,178641161,2017-08-06,140199074,Lachlan,Great little place. Cosy and close to tanunda!
1710462,185563103,2017-08-22,41528318,Melvin,"This studio is highly recommended for anyone who wants a base in Barossa valley..! Great place with modern amenities. Check-in was super easy. Couldn't meet Kylie or Tom but they were reachable over the phone.
Would come back anytime.
Thanks Kylie & Tom."
1710462,189846097,2017-09-03,1192737,Wei Ai,"We had a great time at Kylie and Tom's studio. Everything we needed was available in the spacious one-bedroom studio. The bed is very comfortable after a long day wine-tasting, well-equipped kitchen and plenty of maps and brochures to find out things to do in the area. It's conveniently located just off the Sturt Hwy, a short drive to the many wineries of the Barossa. Definitely recommend!"
1710462,191808992,2017-09-09,83605226,Bek,"This was our first time using Air BnB and we weren't sure what to expect. We loved our stay, the studio is just perfect! Great communication and the animals are super cute. Highly recommend and such a bargain!"
1710462,193009070,2017-09-12,10576888,Kristina,"This is my second time stay at Kylie & Tom's log and it was even better than the first time! I love the privacy, the location, the utilities and how amazing the hosts are!

Cannot wait to return again and you best bet I will be stay here :)"

1710462,197225819,2017-09-25,18788296,Jarrod,"Perfectly located, easy to find and so comfortable. Kylie and Tom were great communicators, but also very respectful of our privacy. Would recommend to anyone"

1710462,199766240,2017-10-03,138274449,Helen,"The Studio is sparkling as if brand new, yet it is beautifully set up to be intimate and cosy. Its hosts are near but not intrusive. The location is quiet, easy to find and perfect for Heysen Trail walkers or Barossa visitors who have visiting the region's excellent wineries and restaurants and markets on their mind. It is easy to see why many guests intend to stay here again."
1710462,201214059,2017-10-08,147496912,Anthony,We loved the place to the point where we felt like we could live in it long-term.
1710462,202348534,2017-10-11,90549559,Barbara,"Wow! We thought we arrived in a luxury hotel when we entered the studio. Everything you could want or need was there, it was very clean and lovely touches like the chocolate on the pillow just made us feel so welcome. Thank you so much, Kylie and Tom."
1710462,203047346,2017-10-14,46214105,Kristina,"A perfect place to stay! The surrounding views were beautiful, the place itself was cosy and comfortable with everything you'd need. Great value for money and good for visiting the Barossa if you have a car. Thanks so much Kylie and Tom"
1710462,203327374,2017-10-15,2072132,Louise,"We had a great time at the studio! It was perfect for us with a little bubba, and kylie set up a porta cot for us, making out stay extra easy. After leaving a few things at the studio, kylie had very generously offered to post them back to us- we couldn't have asked for better hosts, and it was such a perfect location in the Barossa."
1710462,204392449,2017-10-18,31728464,Chloe,"Kylie and Tom's place was great for a couple of nights in the Barossa, it is fully equipped, but a little way from any main shops/towns such as Tanunda/Lyndoch, but if you have a car it's a beautiful area to drive around.  I didn't meet Kylie or Tom, but received all the info I needed for our stay a couple of days before our arrival, and knew they were just a call away should I need anything else. "
1710462,205330430,2017-10-22,131268812,David,Lovely studio.  Well appointed and close to the wineries. Had a great stay.
1710462,206527608,2017-10-26,117581393,Anna,"I loved my time at the studio which capped off an amazing time at the Barossa.  Modern, comfortable, inviting and just a short drive from town ... you won't regret staying here."

1710462,207786168,2017-10-29,155046778,Laura,"A lovely little shed at first glance, but definitely a home away from home! Beautiful location and very friendly hosts in the stunning area of the Barossa Valley. Would love to stay again one day soon. Thanks Kylie and Tom"

1710462,209747461,2017-11-05,81173080,Iain,"Great communication, clean and modern place .  Well equipped for a good price. Only fault I have is the traffic noise."

1710462,212668462,2017-11-18,7029905,Silvia,"Very lovely place to stay! Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job styling and decorating and if we stayed more than one night the kitchen would have come in very handy!  It's in an excellent location for the wineries, and is situated at a nice and private part of the property. An excellent get away! :-)"
1710462,214127346,2017-11-24,138613341,Rebecca,"We stayed at Kylie and Tom's place for three nights. It was a secluded and private building far back from the highway and it provided us with all the comforts at home. It was wonderful for us to be able to collapse on the comfortable couche under the air conditioner after a long hard day sampling the delights of the Barossa. It is a well-located and ideal place to explore the region, and I cannot recommend it enough! Thank you, Nick and Rebecca"
1710462,215144814,2017-11-27,42155496,Cherie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the quiet of rural surrounds (although you do get some muffled traffic noise from the main road) - and enjoyed the space looking out towards the hills, and over the fields etc.  This is actually a one-bedroom place, and was beautifully setup and clean with everything we needed. The nespresso machine was an extra bonus! A very refreshing time there!"
1710462,216007451,2017-12-02,3398589,Robert,Great location less than 10 minutes to amazing wineries and restaurants. Lovely place with wonderful hosts. Highly recommended. Look forward to staying again!
1710462,218749808,2017-12-14,106968577,Zak,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1710462,218968658,2017-12-16,153448289,Anton,"We thoroughly enjoyed the Studio which was very convenient to the places we wanted to visit, especially in and around the Barossa. It offered good standard and comfortable amenity and was great value for money. We will stay again when we next visit SA."
1710462,220775987,2017-12-23,153562066,Meryl,"Private with great amenities. Kylie and Tom were close but left me to myself - just what I needed. Good location for the activities I wanted to do  - an easy drive to the Barossa, Clare Valley and Gawler. And the pony saying 'hello' one morning was a cheerful bonus."
1710462,224688405,2018-01-04,18393551,Kayla-Lynn,"Communication was extremely quick. They left us to our vices, but were available if we needed anything. The place was very tidy and you would never guess that you were staying a shed from the inside. The location was very convenient, but a little noisier than expected due to it's location off a major highway. That being said traffic was very limited during the late hours. Great local suggestions were provided to explore during our stay. Would recommend :)"
1710462,225534301,2018-01-06,17269400,Amy,"Perfect location for exploring the Barossa Valley- you’re only 15 mins outside of the main town Tanunda. 
This apartment is such great value for money! We were blown away by it. Good communication- Kylie responded promptly to any emails or text messages I sent and were happy to engage with us when we wanted. 
I’ll definitely be staying here again on my next visit!"
1710462,243989768,2018-03-17,51196874,Angelique,"For a  weekend getaway to the Barossa, Kylie and Tom’s place was perfect. From the reserved location to the quality of the linen and towels, it truly was lovely to be able to rewind at their air bnb after a full day of wining and dining. The folder full of local recommendations was a great touch too!

Thank you!"
1710462,246155823,2018-03-25,42821325,Sandy,Great spot halfway between Barossa and Gawler
1710462,247842355,2018-03-30,116665777,Bianca,"A beautiful studio away from the busy city in a quiet secluded area. Very easy to find and it is a short drive from Barossa Valley. The studio has everything you need for a weekend away, we will definitely be back again."

1710462,257913702,2018-04-28,26927616,Deborah,"This is an easy place to find and a good location to explore the valley. Kylie and Tom were unobtrusive but there if needed, and responded to our concerns, making us feel welcome. The decor and attention to detail made this place feel like your own. Everything you would need was there and more.
Traffic noise in the quiet of the country could annoy, if you let it, but the comfort of the place far outweighed what some earplugs would provide."
1710462,258257213,2018-04-29,157862729,Cj,Perfectly clean! Quite a bit of highway noise but the glass doors block some of it out. Thanks for having us!

We were very comfortable.
It’s a little out of town but the clear directions given made it easy to find and we loved  being out in the countryside.
We would recommend and would love to stay again."
1710462,266297396,2018-05-20,72251927,Evan,"We had a lovely stay. Tanunda and great wineries all close by, and the Barossa Farmers market. We especially loved our sheep and calf neighbours, they're very friendly and like to say hi through the fence."
1710462,266954178,2018-05-20,23406354,Leith,Take some earplugs if traffic noise bothers you but this is one of the best value and more unique stays I've experienced thru Airbnb. Would love to come again in the future and see how Kylie and Tom have progressed since the bushfire damaged the property. Good luck guys!
1710462,269168556,2018-05-27,29201754,Lija,Had a great stay at Kylie and Tom's place. Awesome little place right near the Barossa. super easy to get to all of the wineries. Definitely recommend!!

1710462,325854005,2018-09-21,56158532,Heidi,Suited our needs as we were waiting for our house to become available as we are moving to the valley.  Loved the outlook and privacy and still close enough to everything. Would be a good place to base yourself if holidaying.
1710462,327983838,2018-09-25,3825195,Randi,Easy check in & pretty close to everything. Great central spot for exploring the Barossa Valley.

1710462,332261949,2018-10-05,145465507,Donna,Sheaoak Log Studio is a great little place for exploring the Barossa region.  It is conveniently located just off the Sturt Highway and a short drive to Greenock or Seppeltsfield (about 5 minutes) or a longer drive to Tanunda (about 10 minutes).  You definitely require a car to stay here. The Studio contains a full kitchen which we appreciated. Bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was appreciated.  A great place to stay to explore the Barossa region.  Thank you
1710462,333122532,2018-10-07,169178143,Trish,"Great place, nicely situated but very close to a noisy road."

Definitely recommended"
1710462,346247102,2018-11-08,26839878,Colleen,"Great amenities and space for 2 guests. The kitchen had everything we needed, along with some other unexpected touches. Good location providing you have a car, as it was easier to tour the Barossa Valley.  The only negative thing was that the Sturt Highway ran past the place and it took a bit to get off to sleep. Thankfully I packed some ear plugs. Pillows were the most comfortable I've had yet at an airbnb!"
1710462,346781071,2018-11-09,35679494,Matt,"Great stay and great hosts. Very clean and very cute space. Very handy for touring Barossa valley and great value for money. Great communication. Place is just of the main highway, but set amongst fields and soon to be vines and doesn’t detract from the stay at all."

1710462,355415193,2018-12-04,41881299,Sandy,"Pleasant stay, spacious surroundings. A bit of noise from traffic yet no big deal. NOTE: There is NO wi fi provided in the cabin which can be a problem as one has to use their own data and not everyone has unlimited data. Cleanliness needs improving."

1710462,358549238,2018-12-14,10162034,Rachel,"Kylie and Tom’s studio was a perfect oasis following a long day’s walk. Spotlessly clean, with everything I needed for a very relaxing stay. Kylie had even left some extra food provisions for me which was a thoughtful touch. While the studio is on the Sturt Highway, it still feels like a real haven, and I would definitely consider coming back for a few quiet days to myself. I must say the lack of wifi was a real treat - a break from social media can be so refreshing...! Best wishes Kylie and Tom - I hope to visit again some time."

1710462,425774223,2019-03-19,247694987,Neil,"Great value, and only a ten-minute drive from the edge of the Barossa. At only 100 metres from the highway, I thought I’d have trouble sleeping, but the noise didn’t bother me. Nicely decorated, though a few little things needed repair. The main problem was cooling down the bedroom. No wi-fi, no washing machine, but overall, not bad."
1710462,429114133,2019-03-27,9154629,Nancy,"Don’t be fooled into thinking Shea-Oak Log is too far away from the town or wineries you want to visit!  Come stay for awhile and enjoy the friendly sheep and calm country ambience.  The space was perfectly clean and tidy, the bed was extra-comfortable and delivered a superb night of rest, and the views of the valley and surrounding hillside couldn’t be lovelier."

A little bit out of town but you get to drive into Tanunda which is so picturesque - we enjoyed our space at the studio and not having just a hotel room. Loved having a kitchen so we could make some easy meals after a day of exploring and wine tasting (much better for the wallet!). Great little studio with everything you need, comfy bed and lounge and good bathroom. Also the rainwater drinking tap was amazing. So clean and fresh water, it was delicious! Thanks Kylie and Tom for our stay! We have a fabulous time!"

Road noise might be an issue for a light sleeper (occasional truck in the early morning), but I popped on a fan to make 'white noise' and had no problems sleeping. 

Given the price it is excellent value!"

The studio was perfect for what we needed with the 1 bedroom and great range of kitchen utilities and space. Information and instructions for check in were easy to follow and the added messaging support for any troubles was well noted, with Kylie and Tom always happy to help if we needed anything. Great location to explore the barossa and explore some great wineries and lunch locations. Perfect for couples, and would definitely book again if I needed to stay out that way."

1710462,708838117,2020-11-14,20883384,Nic,"Nice space created from an old shed. Be sure to get up early and watch the sunrise directly out the front, its worth the wake up call."

1710462,717975898,2020-12-24,24922106,Samuel,"Easy access to the Barossa in quiet, clean accommodation. The bed was very comfortable too"
1710462,718534012,2020-12-26,236062067,Juliany,"Perfect little place to get away from your busy work/study routine. 
It was very easy to find the studio and although it is located close to the main road, the landscape is still beautiful and peaceful. 
The kitchen has everything you need, including a big fridge. We drove 10 min to find some restaurants in Tanunda, but having that nice kitchen was very handy as I was able to prepare some pretty decent and easy meals - as I didn’t want to go for a drive every time I needed food. They provided us with a good supply of coffee, which we loved. 
Overall, the place is very clean and tidy. Sofas and bed were super comfortable. Bathroom is quite good too. 
It got quite hot in the two days we stayed there, but we were able to manage it with the air conditioners. In the evening the temperature drops quite fast, so we didn’t have trouble sleeping at all - had the fan on."
1710462,718981551,2020-12-27,182548342,Ned,"Great location, everything you want in the one place."
1710462,719908457,2020-12-30,159273780,Ealasaid,Good location for the Barossa.

1710462,722464702,2021-01-06,136867932,Adam,Great base to explore all the Barossa has to offer. Not far from anywhere. Accommodation was clean and presented exactly as the photos are online. Highly recommend

1710462,727792549,2021-01-30,82029175,Jessica,"Kylie & toms place was beautiful and very quiet and peaceful. The studio itself has everything you need for a weekend stay, the bed is super comfy! The communication between Kylie and myself was wonderful and she made us feel extremely welcome."
1710462,729322130,2021-02-06,385922189,Braiden,"Beautiful little place that is close to the wonderful Barossa area.

They had horses that you could see / pat as well which was an awesome bonus!"
1710462,730898565,2021-02-13,385893005,Lawrence,A lovely little place with all the essential needs for an awesome stay! Very thoughtfully styled place with information about the local area. Excellent place especially for the value!
1710462,732087643,2021-02-17,120413535,Lilian,Cosy accomodation within 15-20 minutes of the main attractions in the Barossa region. Stayed for a night and would definitely consider staying again in the future.
1710462,732488028,2021-02-18,240535687,Kelsey,The stay at Kylie and Tom’s studio was just at the right location for us and communication was very good.

1710462,738010017,2021-03-10,21544816,Sally,"Very good location for discovering Barossa area. Though the accommodation sadly lacking in attention to detail eg lights not working, toilet constantly running etc. and lack of general cleanliness . 
The 6 lane highway noise is constant and at times very bad."
1787389,58884569,2016-01-05,12017568,Kate,"We stayed here for 3 nights as two adults couples. This is a great apartment just off the Main Street of Tanunda. It is well appointed and clean with access to a laundry and pool which is great. The kitchen was perfect for light dinners, after big lunches in the region. 
Communication and checking in and out were easy. 
The only thing I would say, is that for international travelers, the lack of free wifi ($10/day instead) may be a drawback. Being from Australia we could use our own internet, but it seems like something that could be easily fixed. 
We would definitely stay again. "
1787389,60566666,2016-01-25,2408520,John,"What a lovely place to stay, the apartment was & loooked better than the online photos. The location was perfect, it was clean and well appointed. The only negative for me was that for the price I think the pillows could have been better. I would stay here again. 
Thank you Kym. "
1787389,62584076,2016-02-15,18795783,Helen,"This is a great apartment, spacious and well maintained. 
I would say they only thing lacking is WIFI.
Very good location for exploring the Barossa. "

1787389,70853669,2016-04-21,15816038,Carol,"Tanunda and Barossa Valley are so very lovely, especially the people.   So warm and welcoming, to be sure.  

Our rental was situated in a prime location, downtown Tanunda.  The check-in process was easy, always a plus.

I would recommend the Valley Apartments for a stay in the Barossa."
1787389,80152078,2016-06-16,12487731,Marina,"Very efficient process in order to obtain the key. 
Lovely, clean and modern apartments very central to the main street.
Absolutely loved them and we would definitely stay there again. Thank you "
1787389,90569749,2016-08-01,12852497,Samantha,"The apartment was spacious, clean and well equipped. There were fresh towels and sheets and hotel-like toiletries. Kim was helpful and quick to respond to our needs. 

The apartment would have been better if there was a little bit more entertainment such as a selection of DVDs, an Apple TV (or equivalent) and some cards or board games. "
1787389,100151415,2016-09-07,11711933,Nicole,"Fantastic, clean apartment in a fabulous location! Nice and private off the Main Street. Will definitely stay again! "

1787389,184495468,2017-08-20,74221284,James,Great location and warm modern unit. Would stay their again
1787389,199757450,2017-10-03,117252826,Michael,Was a nice comfortable place to stay. Only two of us stayed so Apartment was too big but none the less was nice. I believe the apartment was a little bit over priced but that's just personal preference. 
1787389,202112322,2017-10-10,74753265,Rick,Great apartment
1787389,337895536,2018-10-18,217986758,Jesmond,"A well appointed and well located place close to shops, cafes and restaurants. Would stay there again, especially with a second couple."

1787389,713185962,2020-12-04,22748111,Erin,"Great location, very easy to walk to restaurants and shops. Booking and check in process was very easy. Accomodation was clean. Unfortunately it was very overpriced. $500 for one night on a Thursday in early December. It felt like boutique accomodation prices for a motel feel experience."
2327616,26704447,2015-02-17,26937232,Inam,"We enjoyed our stay, beautiful quiet farm house. "
2327616,29336940,2015-04-06,29769094,Warren,"Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations.  Our hosts were extremely friendly, hospitable and informative.  Bill even took us out to help feed the sheep on his farm!  If you're looking to stay on a peaceful farm in a homely granny flat that is just a short drive from Adelaide and Barossa Valley, Bill's place is perfect.       "
2327616,30841121,2015-04-27,27717042,Andy,Bill and Angela made us feel very welcome and were accommodating of an unexpectedly late arrival. The bungalow was comfortable and cosy and set in the midst of their large farm but close to Gawler. We enjoyed our stay.
2327616,37149302,2015-07-05,1089693,Dong,"Bill and Angela are very nice and prepared all the things we need, with sunny smile and local knowledge.

The whole family enjoyed the quiet farm, sighting the new lambs being born, sunrise. 

Great experience and thanks a lot!"
2327616,43322471,2015-08-18,9495634,Celeste,"The kindest people. Angela made sure we settled in warmly. Bill took time off work on his farm to plan our day trip. We had the honour of meeting their friends too. One of the good fellows even followed up with an itinerary for our trip to KI. 

(The sweetest dogs too. Millie came to sit with us often. Max was always ready to play.)    

The property sits within an hour from Adelaide CBD and Gawler Town, and approximately two hours to Cape Jervis (if you're heading over to KI). You will need a car and to drive on unsurfaced road to reach the farm. (Website hidden by Airbnb) The room with ensuite bathroom is fitted with a very comfortable queen bed (with electric blanket), one extra single bed, heater in both rooms, television and fridge. There were also bread, cereal, juice and milk, on top of cutlery and dishware. 

I would say the pictures are an understatement of how beautiful the property is, especially with the view outside. You will also wake up to the sheep bleating and birds chirping. The perfect getaway with wonderful hosts."
2327616,46649544,2015-09-12,43058481,Suzanne,A pleasant stay on a working farm the highlight of which was the opportunity to see a shearer in action.
2327616,48735343,2015-09-28,42234441,Catherine,"A warm and welcoming couple that we enjoyed chatting with.

A very pleasant little slice of country life, with all care taken to provide homely comforts."
2327616,55254916,2015-11-29,45178332,Will,"What a truly wonderful and relaxing experience! Bill and Angela are both delightful, the views are stunning and  Bills homemade bread in the morning just topped it off. Will definitely be back!"
2327616,58126122,2016-01-01,16888654,Denis,"Hosts Bill and Angela are congenial hosts making us most welcome on arrival and providing helpful advice in advance.
Our nine night stay, covering the final week of December, was very comfortable even with the seasonally high temps.  As listed, the unit is well appointed. The unit and it's outside seating make for a most relaxing view of an attractive ornamental garden and views extending across the fields to the hills of the nearby Barossa.
It is only a short distance of unsealed road to access the property and the reward of experiencing the comforts and hospitality offered are well worth a return visit.
"
2327616,61935743,2016-02-09,28337268,Julie,"Bill and Angela ( and wonder dog Max!) were fabulous hosts we arrived in time to watch some of the shearing of their stud sheep and were then shown through our self sufficient accomodation adjacent to the house in a lovely garden aspect. We had heard all about Bills home made bread from previous vistor reviews and weren't disappointed every morning a couple of large thick slices were waiting for us in the fridge, along with, jam, fresh orange juice, milk and a selection of cereals plus tea and coffee. The location was perfect for us a short drive across the main highway to Gawler and our family we came to visit but quiet enough for us who usually live in the country. Highly recommend and look forward to staying again when we next return to SA. "
2327616,74057490,2016-05-12,5901211,Maree,"Bill and Angela welcomed us warmly. Angela pointed out the location of the food and amenities that they had provided for our breakfasts. As it was late and the shops closed she suggested a local tavern where we could  get some dinner. We really appreciated Angela's advice. Bill was very busy with lambing but took time out to talk with us and explain the operations of the farm. Our flat was very cosy, clean and comfortable. We really felt ""at home""and would love to return some time. Bill's bread made for nice crispy toast!! We really enjoyed being in a country farm environment. Thanks Angela and Bill."
2327616,79067614,2016-06-11,11594164,Ip Na,"Angel and bill were so nice , we had a perfect dinner , share our story and country curtlure , we were really enjoyable , beautiful house , beautiful view ! I think I will never forget this day , thanks so much ! Hope can see u guys in somewhere again ! "
2327616,79442755,2016-06-12,64821446,Kylie,"Bill and angela are just good  decent country people that would take the shirt off their backs for you. My visit was short but amazing, they feed me at short notice after the weather turn rather horrible as i was heading out  but decided not to. Bills bread that he cooks fresh for breakfast is amazing. Wish i had more time to spend with them and would of loved to see more of there beautiful property. If im ever in the area again i would be staying with them with out a doubt. Thanks again for my lovely stay."
2327616,90807021,2016-08-02,15321985,Laura,"Thankyou Bill and Angela for being so accomodating. I had a lovely, short stay- wish it was longer! The space was clean, bed was super comfortable and there was lots of goodies provided. 
Thankyou once again for a good, carefree stay. "
2327616,106928887,2016-10-08,96651769,Karen,I am glad that I found this property and met Bill and Angela.  They made my weekend of having to work locally much more bearable.  Very welcoming and comfortable place to stay.  I hope to be back again and bring hubby with me next time for a longer stay.  Even the family dog made me feel very welcome.
2327616,124835118,2017-01-02,9126247,Kevin,"We really enjoyed our stay on the farm and Bill and Angela were excellent hosts.  They were very friendly and helpful, ensuring we enjoyed our stay.  We would really recommend this accommodation for anyone wanting a quiet country escape.  Max the dog was a real plus!"
2327616,126063428,2017-01-08,78406518,Debbie,We bad a lovely stay at Bill and Angela's. Angela was very obliging when we needed a couple of things. Thanks Bill and Angela for your hospitality. 
2327616,126831882,2017-01-14,74573435,Joel,"Had a great stay, very comfortable and clean. Hosts both very accommodating and friendly"
2327616,145568301,2017-04-18,22390318,Jessica,"Bill and Angela are exceptional hosts. They made us feel at home and looked after us well. I'm a single dad with primary school age children who love farms and animals. Bill let us join in all his farm work and he was brilliant with the kids - so patient and inclusive.  We visited in time for the start of the lambing season. Bottle feeding lambs was a treat for the kids. 
The farm is absolutely beautiful. We were lucky enough to see a lot of the land and some of the old buildings made of local materials. 
Comfortable beds and quality linen had us sleeping well after our days of fun, fresh air and exercise. The cottage is very clean and was freshly painted before our visit. 
Finding the farm was easy. Bill's directions are accurate and the address is easy to find on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps also. 
We will be back for sure. "
2327616,147832333,2017-04-28,68589494,Kerry,"This place is a real get-away from everything, very relaxing and super friendly hosts. Especially good if you want to experience some farm-life. Nice B&B style, and not too far to drive for dinner etc. "
2327616,179594163,2017-08-08,22390318,Jessica,This was my second visit with my kids. We loved our first visit so much the kids were begging me to go back. This place is so pretty in the winter when it's all green. Bill and Angela are wonderful hosts and made us feel very welcome once again.  
2327616,213128057,2017-11-19,102785054,Andy,Great self contained room - brought my own food which I didn't have to as there was breakfast laid on every day which I didn't use.
2327616,215819268,2017-12-01,34500288,Daisy ( Thuy),"Bill’s place was just magnificent, you get the idea of peace and serenity immediately you arrive, we will be looking forward to another stay in future."
2327616,217329726,2017-12-08,21545893,John,"Bill and Angela are fantastic hosts; they are friendly and hospitable and I found the farming operation very interesting. They look after you well with home-baked bread and condiments, and are very happy to share their local knowledge. The cottage is very comfortable with lovely views out across the countryside, and a very pleasant outdoor patio to enjoy ""sundowners"" and snacks in the evening. The trip into the northern parts of Adelaide is quick and convenient (approx 30 mins). The proximity to the Barossa is an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb."
2327616,224691403,2018-01-04,125948660,Caitlin,Small space but perfect for 2-3 people. About 30 mins from Tanunda (main town of the Barossa Valley). They have kettle and tea/coffee but no microwave or kitchen amenities. Hosts are wonderful and very friendly and helpful :) the accommodation is on their farm next to their house but still feels private.
2327616,236317464,2018-02-19,21910251,Chantelle,We really enjoyed the location and beautiful surroundings of the property. The apartment is small but cosy. The proximity to the main house is very close but we happened to stay while the owners were away which made it very quiet and private. Unfortunately the wifi only worked for the first night and then would not work again. Also the apartment was quite dusty and had cobweb corners. But everything else was clean and tidy. The continental breakfast provided was very nice and it was nice to have our dishes cleaned up for us each day. Overall we did enjoy our stay and found it comfortable.
2327616,237672007,2018-02-23,135431348,Jacob,Great little space with beautiful views and beautiful hosts.
2327616,239702256,2018-03-02,95956096,Carla,"Bill and Angela’s hospitality was outstanding, they helped us during the stress of moving house. Their beautiful home has helped us de-stress and relax during this crazy time, fresh bread everyday and a little tour of the farm made our stay extra special."
2327616,243997510,2018-03-17,97857527,Rowena,Great location to explore the mid North from. Very friendly hosts and generous continental breakfast.
2327616,249295021,2018-04-02,79411860,Patsy,"We had an excellent experience staying at Bill's place. The place was very relaxing and provided my husband and myself a much needed break. His two dogs provided excellent pet therapy! Bill & his wife were very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions for places to eat, things to do etc. The daily provision of freshly baked bread was just the icing on the cake! We look forward to staying here again when we visit next."
2327616,254152074,2018-04-15,159127277,Sindy,So comfortable and great views

2327616,320426754,2018-09-09,46889079,Tomoko,"I stayed at their place with my 2 kids 
to visit my friend lives nearby.
They all are very beautiful, my kids could have a precious farm experience and we really loved everything.

The room is not so big, no kicthen amenity, but good enough for us, 
we had great scenery from the window and it was greater experience  for kids than to stay luxually hotel!

Will visit again!!
Thank you!"
2327616,333128440,2018-10-07,95079074,Peter,If you are staying in Angle Vale is it very close to shops and entertainment . I do recommend it.

2327616,363496317,2018-12-28,229492009,Sukitti,We had a wonderful time staying at Bill's place. We especially loved the farm tour. It was amazing! We learned a lot about sheep and farming. The room was great as well. Space greatly used. Perfect for a family or a group of friends. Super comfy beds and the shower pressure is outstanding! It definitely felt like a home away from home. And the surroundings are beautiful. Bill and Angela were such warm and welcoming host. Thank you!
2327616,367016964,2019-01-03,181401066,Wendy,"Bill's place is a lovely quiet space right next to his home but overlooking the patio, grape arbour and distant hills. Bill welcomed our young son to feed the sheep which was special. We really looked forward to going 'home' to the farm after long touristy days."
2327616,400063080,2019-01-10,29293106,Maria,"We booked this accommodation for two of our workers who needed to complete a job in the area.  The location was excellent and as far as I can ascertain, all went without a hitch with the booking.  There were no complaints from our guys and the accommodation worked out well."

The country home is clean, welcoming, spacious and has a real country touch to it. As an animal person I loved being able to play with the dogs each night when I got home. I would definitely recommend staying at Bill and Angela’s."
2327616,420822960,2019-03-07,39554467,Ken,"We really enjoyed staying in the guest cabin, with Bill and Angela as our hosts. They could not have been better hosts, providing us with an experience well above our expectations.
We were particularly pleased with the help Bill and Angela provided with an unexpected complication. Nothing was too much trouble.  given the property was a very busy working farm, Bill was only too happy to explain how the property operated and it has given us a more informed view of farm life in Australia.

We will happily seek to stay here again when visiting SA.

An added bonus is the two dogs we got to play with, Max and Rosi.  We thought about taking Max home with us but decided Max would miss being a sheepdog.  Bill told us that Max thinks he's a sheep dog but he's not very good at it.  Nevertheless , it was fun to see Max jump onto the hay ute each morning, chase the sheep and think he's doing a great job.  And Rosie is just a little sweetie who likes a bit of attention.

We would recommend this stay to anybody who seeks a totally different AirBnB experience in SA.

And the bread Bill makes each day for breakfast is simply the best toast we have ever had."
2327616,439883908,2019-04-20,253545329,Peter,"The thoughtfulness, kindness, generosity and hospitality was amazing. Beautiful location, lovely accomodation and the going above and beyond was heart warming. Bill and Angela , thank you so much for a lovely experience."

2327616,447026549,2019-05-03,39554467,Ken,"Bill and Angela are great hosts. Nothing is too much trouble. An added benefit is that the property is a substantial working sheep farm. So quiet, yet located very close to the famous Barossa Valley where there is no end of interesting places to visit.  This is our second stay with Bill and Angela and we will not hesitate to stay again when next in the area."
2327616,474238318,2019-06-23,145888636,Charlie,Bill and Angela were amazing hosts. The scenery was beautiful and they have lovely animals! Awesome hospitality and location.

The accomodation for my son and I was perfect as we used the place as a base for a local event we were at. My only regret is that we didn’t get a chance to look around Bill’s farm.  We’ll be back next year for sure, thanks Bill."
2327616,485959253,2019-07-11,18639273,Rachel,"The place has everything you need, nice and cosy. Breakfast provided. The guest suite is quite close to the main house so there’s not much privacy. Bill and Angela were friendly and helpful. The dogs are cute!"
2327616,494210042,2019-07-24,194825997,Leigh,"This was a very peaceful stay on a working farm. The room is very comfy and warm, particularly cosy in the cold winter weather. The family are very friendly and helpful.

2327616,551140426,2019-10-20,190247918,Amy,Nice little granny flat to stay in especially if you want to see a real working farm in action. The dogs are beautiful and friendly and greet you on arrival along with the hosts. Thank you for a relaxing stay.
2327616,552963974,2019-10-22,126690652,Alan,Warm friendly and down to earth people who work hard on their farm. So fascinating to see how life on a farm really is. Not your average City accommodation but everything works and provides a unique experience
2327616,554805145,2019-10-27,11531497,Tara,A comfortable and cosy place to stay in a delightful rural setting.

2327616,564069782,2019-11-14,157576218,Laurence,"As described. Very easy for me as I could check in and out when I wanted.
Road track to access the farm. 
I had the chance to see a large kangarroo early morning in the field"
2327616,586520043,2020-01-01,322084279,Aamir,That was a great experience of my stay...

2327616,598329369,2020-01-26,85022671,Shrey,Bill’s place in the true farm stay experience in Barossa. Some great recommendations and comfortable accommodation. Loved the interaction with the dogs at the property. Will book again/recommend
2327616,607859608,2020-02-19,96651769,Karen,"A return stay for me and once again I had a lovely stay with such a welcoming family.  It feels like a home away from home and even though my stay was for work-related purposes again, it didn't take long to relax and unwind in a comfortable farm setting.  Seeing Max the Border Collie again and newborn triplet lambs a highlight!"
2327616,616563267,2020-03-10,95983801,Maree,Bill's place is about 10 minutes out of Gawler so is handy to all amenities.   We loved staying on a working farm and the farm tour was a highlight.  Bill's home baked bread was also a highlight for us.  Yum!
2327616,618244730,2020-03-15,3482640,Vadim,"Doors / window overlooks to east and you can enjoy sunrise right from your bed.
Bill has 2 grandkids and thus a lot of scooters, bikes, toys you can use, so our 2 kids were happy to play.
Bill showed around his farm, told about its history, how things are done - that was interesting and I got what I was hoping for.

In reality stains on carpet and white cover spoiled first impression.
This is a guesthouse with a metallic roof, as in garage. 
Spider webs in some corners. Different type of bugs notices in the house and one in bed.
Bed was way too soft for me. First morning was harsh after such bed, second one was ok, as I slept only on my back.
No wifi signal in the guesthouse or even on a patio by it. Had to use my mobile as a hotspot. 

Comparatively, it was far from worth of $290 for 2 nights (because of the cleaning fee $30 and Airbnb commission). However, $90 is a good price."
2327616,628077774,2020-06-07,183082528,Mina,"Bill's place was so nice. The place wasn't not only for staying, the whole area was amazing wildpark. I feel. Guests can be experienced real farm life such as feeding lambs.
I was so happy to stay there."
2327616,629824282,2020-06-15,334826255,Katy,A nice peaceful getaway place. Perfect if you love farm stays and being surrounded by animals.

2327616,668928561,2020-09-28,366686410,Jessica,Thanks for our stay bill! We enjoyed sitting on the couch and looking out at the beautiful farm property. We loved the very generous & specific breakfast supplies for our dietary requirements  & you accomodating our baby with a high chair & cot was very handy.
2327616,670347992,2020-10-02,369766957,Tina,Very nice place
2327616,703445643,2020-10-25,372360608,Nicki,"A hidden little gem, we only wish we could have stayed longer. The view is amazing, it was lovely to lay in bed and look out over the fields and the sheep ‘alarm clocks’ were nice to wake up to. 

We were welcomed and made to feel at home straight away. The accommodation was perfect for us and had everything we needed. They may just have one of the the most comfortable beds I’ve ever slept in.

My 10 year old loved the games and movies. He’s already asking when we can go back.

Perfect location for us, close to family and we will be repeat visitors."
2327616,739294249,2021-03-15,32551341,Rowena,We so enjoyed stay at Bill and Angela's place. Lovely hosts. We appreciated being accommodated at late notice. It was perfect for our needs and we will be back next time we are passing through. Thank you. :)
2567051,22607724,2014-11-10,22738488,Danya,"We spent the most fabulous weekend in the stunning Miners cottage in an idyllic setting, overlooking a beautiful creek, gum trees and teeming with indigenous wild life. 
The cottage was very well appointed with a good eye to detail and very comfortable beds. We received a warm welcome and great hospitality with a well stocked fridge and provisions, even down to home made bread . If one wants to combine a true getaway and authentic experience in the Barossa this is your answer.
"
2567051,27211222,2015-02-28,1873759,Donnie,"Rebecca and Nick are wonderful hosts. In the evening you are treated to Kangaroos just outside your door, in the morning Rebecca has all of the fixings for a wonderful farm-fresh breakfast. 

The cottage is wonderfully restored, and beautifully decorated. It's a great place to relax, or as a base to see the Barossa Valley."
2567051,27819668,2015-03-12,28893291,Wade,"Great location, great food. A pleasure to stay here, especially seeing the kangaroos on the lawn at night."

Well positioned to explore the Barossa region. A++"
2567051,51720709,2015-10-24,6564369,Clare,"We enjoyed a ""mini moon"" for a couple of nights post our wedding. The miners cottage was perfect accommodation. Beautiful outlook, enjoyed dining outside, breakfasts were amazing and the bath lovely. "
2567051,52842249,2015-11-02,8805242,Renae,"Wow what a fabulous place for a cousin retreat. We had such a lovely time. Rebecca made sure we had everything plus some for relaxing getaway.

2567051,70449764,2016-04-17,66518786,James,"10/10 weekend...
Our intentions were to have a romantic weekend away and not be tied up with a busy schedule. Upon being greeted by Rebecca when my partner and I walked into the cottage we instantly said the photos don't do it justice. Even though on the website it's a beautiful cottage the warmth and the atmosphere was amazing. 

We were greeted with decanted port, fresh eggs, chocolates, breakfast, candles, we made our own bread and enjoyed an amazing open fire place. Highly recommended and Rebecca was a great host whenever we needed. Will be staying again for sure. "
2567051,74585535,2016-05-16,7287378,Adrian,Absolutely fantastic. 
2567051,91830700,2016-08-06,47428399,Janelle,"I surprised my husband with a stay at the miner's cottage for 30th and it was perfect. We really enjoyed our stay, it was so comfortable and was a great couple of days of relaxation. Rebecca was a fantastic host, very accomodating and thought of every little detail. It is a beautiful property in Barossa Valley and we loved meeting dog, cat and goats. We would definitely recommend the cottage to others and believe rooms such as the bathroom looked better than the photos.
Great work Rebecca and family."
2567051,103694091,2016-09-23,7309519,Lis,"The cottage was beyond expectations and absolutely gorgeous. The milky way shone brightly at night, the garden grounds and birds chirped cheerily at the back, the comfortable bed was a refuge for dreams and the gorgeous bath a relaxation space in the warm bathroom. Every little detail has been thought through...including the delicious fresh bread! An incredible place to stay."
2567051,105455264,2016-10-02,78178074,David,"What a great location. Rebecca and Nick were great hosts. The cottage was very romantic. Loved the fireplace. The extra things like fresh milk, bacon and eggs, coffee machine were a bonus. Thanks guys it was great.  "

Definitely one of the most romantic getaways in South Australia. "
2567051,159384683,2017-06-11,23407621,Jessica,"The Miner's Cottage is a lovely, quiet place to stay. A bit outside of the main towns, but a really pretty area to relax and have a BBQ out back! We enjoyed the fireplace and making some fresh baked bread in the mornings for breakfast. Rebecca and Nick were really friendly and communicative - we had no troubles checking in or sorting anything that we needed. Would recommend their place for sure! "
2567051,199452702,2017-10-02,2498395,Andrea,An amazing experience! Perfectly picturesque with every imaginable comfort of a 5 star accommodation. Rebecca made us feel very welcome indeed and it is a rare slice of paradise.  I would recommend Rebecca's BnB as THE place to stay to experience the Barossa
2567051,313707075,2018-08-26,184757230,Carolyn,This cosy cottage is packed with personality. Close to everything you need as a home base whilst exploring the local area.

2567051,361612637,2018-12-24,88572037,Meghan,"Cute cottage in a gorgeous amongst nature and kangaroos!  Rebecca’s place was lovely, updated yet with the charm and character you’d hope for. And, pet friendly on top of all that!!

Breakfast came with fruit, yogurt, cereal, bacon and more. High end bathroom amenities, plush comfy bed and a beautiful, peaceful setting. Great place to getaway and de-stress. 

The only suggest I would make to future guests is to use plenty of bug repellent as there are lots of mosquitoes. (Rebecca does provide bug repellent though).

All in all, there isn’t much else I could have asked for."
2567051,367491958,2019-01-05,21991797,Andre,"Lovely place. Beautiful grounds, much more impressive than pictures suggest!"

And the view, and the friendly dog to greet you when you arrive. The cottage is adorable. And frankly my dream destination. Will never stop telling people about this place."
4551374,25747921,2015-01-25,25045757,Ianie,"This was my first try at Airbnb and what a pleasant surprise! Everything was easy - from following the map to accessing the keys and walking into the lovely and very clean little house. With all the food and goodies that was to our disposal, it really felt like our own place for the night. "
4551374,39790958,2015-07-26,36172687,Sarah,"My partner and I are so happy with our decision to spend the night at your cottage. 
You certainly welcomed us from the moment we stepped in, starting with the fireplace already lit so that the room was warm and cozy, to the cute welcome notes, to the loads of condiments left in the fridge and sitting on the counter and to the many options available in terms of entertainment (eg plenty of magazines and DVDs to watch).
Your cottage was immaculate and your backyard was really pretty. We definitely need to come in summer so we can make use of the BBQ and outdoor seating.
Thanks again for being wonderful hosts!"
4551374,146480926,2017-04-23,95350410,Casey,"A fantastic, relaxing cottage. Could not have asked for anything more. We'll be back for sure!"

5185834,39425831,2015-07-23,37531152,Jasmine,"Loved Trinity cottage, great views of the Barossa valley especially sunset was quiet romantic. Location was ideal, close to allot of wineries by car thou, it was vey easy to get around. We did not met our host Kim but the cottage was clean and full of everything that we needed for our stay, thank you so much for the wine, it was very relaxing drinking it next to warm wood fire. This cottage was a perfect romantic getaway!! I definitely will visit again soon. "
5185834,49782759,2015-10-06,2255724,William,"Trinity Cottage was amazing: secluded but not too far away from the wineries, restaurants and towns of the Barossa; simple yet modern in just the right way; and filled to the brim with food, utensils and anything else you could possibly need. We loved our stay here and definitely did not want to leave. "
5185834,56117490,2015-12-09,21204187,Ian,"The highlight of our trip was our stay at Trinity Cottage. Far enough from town to feel secluded but close enough to make getting around easy. The View overlooking the vinyard is sublime and the perfect place to sample your purchases after a day touring the wineries. However, what really made the difference was the extra little unexpected touches like a ready stocked fridge and bathroom. We also lost a bracelet which Scott and Kim managed to have back to us by the time we arrived home"
5185834,58590494,2016-01-03,8151882,Evelyn,"We stayed at Trinity Cottage for a week and had an amazing time. The cottage is in a quiet, secluded area which was a much needed relief from busy lives, but also a short drive into town and heaps of fantastic wineries.

The house is in great condition and had everything you could need, including all the comforts of home and breakfast provisions! 

Would definitely recommend staying  here as we will next time we're in the Barossa. 

11/10!"
5185834,64884254,2016-03-08,25608159,Rebecca,"So pretty watching the sunset from the front porch overlooking the vines. It's a delightful cottage which stayed cool during the days despite the heatwave conditions outside. So many little treats left for us by the owner. Very private and secluded. 

We had a delightful and romantic time and really enjoyed our stay."
5185834,79788586,2016-06-14,53745983,Charmaine,"Perfect cottage in a beautiful location stacked with almost enough local produce you don't need to leave the fire - except for wine! The owner, Scott, was extremely helpful and friendly and made himself available for a few house questions. Can't recommend this cottage enough, enjoy!"
5185834,138084008,2017-03-18,47728971,Dan,Perfect place for a weekend escape to the Barossa. 
5185834,144135268,2017-04-14,101903299,Stewart,A fantastic cottage to stay in for a week long retreat to the Barossa. Great beds and a well stocked kitchen with plenty of wonderful food provided for many breakfasts. This places has the most amazing views of sunsets over the nearby vineyards. Highly recommended if you want something with a little character.
5185834,146172192,2017-04-21,86594276,Susan,"What a gem of a find!  This cottage reminded me of my childhood growing up in rural Qld.  The cottage was immaculate and had everything and more you could wish for.  So much was supplied and the best farm fresh eggs ever.  Everything from milk, juice, bacon, port, biscuits, wine you name it and it was supplied.  The cottage is extremely private and quiet and just what we needed for a week away from reality.  Restaurants and wineries are a small drive away.  I met the friendliest people in the Barossa Valley and what a community as they all support each other.  We loved Lambert Winery not too far away.  I would not hesitate recommending this cottage to anyone.  Hope to revisit again soon."
5185834,153351472,2017-05-20,16937247,Luke,"Amazing cottage. Incredible, location. Loved waking up to the birds with a cup of tea, looking out to the vineyards in peace and quiet. My partner and I can't wait to go back ❤️"

5185834,351436163,2018-11-22,12486899,Courtney,"This cottage is so cute & cozy, we really enjoyed our stay. We arrived after getting caught in the rain & were freezing- having the fireplace prepped to be lit was the most beautiful touch. The food provisions were very generous (eggs, milk, bread, tomatoes, mushrooms, juice, yoghurt, biscuits,etc)-exceeded our expectations!! We also thoroughly enjoyed the bottle of Bethany wine that was left for us.   We hadn’t heard of Bethany before, but liked it so much we found the winery & stocked up with some bottles for our trip home. 

The country cottage feel helped us really relax on our holiday. This is one of the best & most professional Air BNB places we’ve stayed."

The cottage had a lot of extra thoughtful touches (port, wine, biscuits...) and was well provisioned with a great breakfast.  Two sheep came to be hand fed at the fence.

5185834,648513224,2020-08-09,96663798,Kayla,"Lovely! My partner and I where both very run down when we got there. We stayed for two nights, we didn’t really go out, only for lunch one day. The cottage was just what we wanted quiet, peaceful and our own company, everything you need was there, with added special touches. 

You won’t regret it "

5185834,730938453,2021-02-14,255044375,Jason,"We loved this place. We had headed for a romantic weekend in the Barossa. This is a quiet and peaceful location off the beaten track, but still close enough to everything. The views are stunning and we loved sitting on the front porch to eat our meals, including the delicious food they provided.
The spa is large and relaxing with candles provided, and the whole place is cosy and comfortable. The garden is well tended and the paths swept.
We really appreciated all the special little touches. Everywhere you looked was something they had thought of.
Recommended!"
5185982,32513950,2015-05-19,30084957,Julia,"This property was a real delight, great space and was a perfect spot for our trip to the Barosssa. Great location to get to the wineries and some great restaurants within a 10 minute walk. A very lovely touch was provision of breakfast food which was greatly enjoyed and appreciated.
The key collection and check out was so easy.
All in all a great property, would highly recommend!"
5185982,34581550,2015-06-09,25535469,Bianca,Such a wonderful home - it was everything we wanted it to be and more! Definitely recommended and will definitely return. 4 stars 
5185982,55350209,2015-12-01,39211748,Elleisha,"Kim is an excellent host and his house was spacious, beautifully presented and absolutely immaculate.
 I highly recommend staying at Lochnagar.  Thank you for you the bacon and eggs in the fridge - that was a pleasant surprise and definitely helped ease our sore heads from all the wine consumed the night before. Once again thanks for everything Kim and apologies for the disorganisation on my end! "
5185982,82535559,2016-06-28,13331935,Tash,The house was absolutely beautiful. Having the heating on for when we arrived at 1am in the morning and breakfast provided was extra special. So close to wineries and the main town. Would definately stay here again! 
5185982,96575121,2016-08-23,39677746,Emma,"We had a great stay at Kim's house this weekend. Perfectly located in close proximity to some amazing wineries, the house is beautifully decorated and set up with really comfy beds! We were also left loads of food for breakfast which was really generous. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay there. Thank you! :-)  "
5185982,159876477,2017-06-12,12101010,Carla,"This is a fantastic house. Very spacious and clean. The kitchen was well stocked, the hosts thought of everything. Would definitely stay here again."

5185982,192685015,2017-09-10,139756653,Ruth,"We have been travelling to the Barossa almost yearly since 2001 and finding suitable accomodation has always been a challenge when travelling in a group.  This house was perfect for three unrelated adults/ couples each able to have their own room and bathroom with a communal area to eat.  The kitchen was well stocked with crockery, glasses and equipment.  The breakfast provisions were also very good.  The flavour of the tomatoes were sensational.  Overall this has been our best experience so far.  We will use again"
5185982,208547132,2017-11-02,150597637,Diana,"Very comfortable, and a good base for us while we were in the area!"
5185982,330712522,2018-10-01,52216946,Austin,"We enjoyed our stay, the house and yard is nice and the breakfast supplies were generous. A few small things could be improved, there is a note about internet usage being limited and having to unpack and repack the outdoor furniture in the garage was more work than I’d have preferred. I would stay here again."
5185982,451456412,2019-05-11,11378458,Robert,"Fantastic! Spotlessly clean, amazing breakfast supplies & complimentary wine and loved the wood burner. Great accommodation for spending a weekend away with friends. Highly recommended and would not hesitate to stay here again!"
5185982,665914351,2020-09-20,16287653,Angeline,"Me and my family loved the location which is in the heart of Barossa, and that each room had their own en-suite! Thanks for the wine and beautiful selection of breakfast ingredients!"
5289072,52133158,2015-10-26,25080800,Niusha,"A spacious house set on a hill overlooking the valleys and majestic gums. Perfect base to explore the hills, we stayed with 5 of us, 2 couples and a single, and it was ideal for us.
Well appointed throughout, comfortable beds, we'll be back."
5289072,54019796,2015-11-15,19433775,Kae,"My family and I (5 people) had an awesome time up at this residence. It was the true Barossa experience we were wanting... being in the middle of nowhere with all the scenery!
Phillip was very hospitable even before we got there and made sure we were comfortable throughout the whole stay.
We had the whole place to ourselves and it was truly relaxing. We would sleep to the sounds of the sheep, and wake up to the birds chirping.
The house had everything we needed plus more... plenty of space!
We definitely know where we'll stay again when we return to the Barossa.
This place is highly recomended. "
5289072,63350554,2016-02-22,5396634,Jo,"My family and I (5 of us) had such a great time staying in the Barossa at Phil's place! Phil met us at the house and quickly showed us around, and pointed us in the direction of some travel guides which had recommendations of the area. 

The house was well equipped with everything you need for preparing a meal with everything you pick up at the nearby Farmer's Markets. The rooms were comfortable and there was plenty of space for everyone. We would definitely go back!

No drawbacks at all, but given the location if you're staying here you'll definitely want a car. We booked knowing this, and made plenty of use of my parent's car. That said - there are lots of wine tour guides that will pick you up too :) "
5289072,64358185,2016-03-03,53360034,Adrian,"We enjoyed our stay immensely, the property was clean and suited our needs. Phil was super helpful and very welcoming. Would recommend as a great base for exploring the barossa."
5289072,67411095,2016-03-29,53918241,Jules,"The house was perfectly equipped for us and Phil was very helpful. It was a great location being a bit off track for quiet times in the countryside and then to head in wine tasting. Great value for money, thoroughly enjoyed our visit. "
5289072,67880938,2016-04-01,57488252,Lily,"My friends and I stayed at this beautiful property for a bit of R&R during our Dragon Boat racing. It was exactly what we expected, nice quiet retreat to get away from it all but very handy to explore the wineries in this region. One of my friends accidentally left a bag of clothes behind and Phillip was kind enough to bring it back to him in the city. Wonderful place to stay, loads of room, everything you would need or want."
5289072,69123378,2016-04-09,63681255,Stefan,"Our final day at Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm summed up our experience = NO ONE WANTED TO LEAVE!!! We were all too comfortable, too relaxed, & too 'at home'. Having the whole home to ourselves (4 people) was a spacious treat. Everything was available for use (bathroom & kitchen) - we really didn't need to bring anything along in advance. The isolated & rustic environment transpired into a peaceful & tranquil existence after each day's hard work sampling wine, cheese & treats in the Eden & Barossa Valleys! Very pleased we stayed here, rather than on a main road or in a busier urban area. The property caters for all ages & would be ideal for a family - sheep, kangaroos, abundance of bird life & I even thought I saw a rabbit! Highly recommended."
5289072,70755471,2016-04-20,11219021,Ruth,"Thankyou very much for a lovely stay in your spacious home.
We loved the extensive views, sense of isolation, prolific birdlife and proximity to the Lavender Federation Trail (our aim of completing the Springton to Truro section was easily met).

The house was clean, comfortable, and very generously supplied with everything one could possibly need/want.

It was lovely to meet Mary (and discover we had been fellow walkers many many years ago!)

"
5289072,71467687,2016-04-25,1623747,Sue,Phillip and his wife met us on arrival abs showed us around the house. They made us feel very welcome and the house was lovely. Plenty of space which was great with 6 of us sharing. The surrounds were peaceful but not too far from anywhere in the Barossa. The bird life in particular was a delight for me. We would definitely stay again.
5289072,71727791,2016-04-28,11530317,Natasha & Michael,"Despite our late arrival, Mary was gracious enough to wait for us patiently and provide us with helpful information about the location. The property is beautiful and the home is welcoming, spacious and well looked after. "
5289072,72185675,2016-05-01,65995774,Penny,"This beautiful Mt McKenzie property is the perfect retreat - spacious rooms with plenty of natural light, modern kitchen and bathrooms, comfortable beds, outdoor seating areas to enjoy the sunshine and an incredible view. Phil is very helpful and welcoming. It's an easy drive to Barossa towns and wineries. My friends and I loved our stay and left feeling refreshed and relaxed. We highly recommend this property."

5289072,81519948,2016-06-23,17622932,Shannon,"We loved our time at the Mt Mckenzie raspberry farm. Phillip was very easy to communicate with and friendly. He greeted us on arrival, was very welcoming and introduced us to what we needed to know about the log cabin. The pictures are an understatement to the beauty that surrounds this property and we were happy to share the experience with the wildlife. Apart from this, the cabin is well equipped with everything you need. Excellent fire and a homely feel! The nearest town Angaston is also a treat and only ten minutes down the road with nice restaurants, a grocery store and a the famous Barossa cheese company shop. A relaxing getaway in a beautiful region! Thanks again Phillip! Much appreciated! :)"
5289072,82998151,2016-06-30,67290287,Scott,"We were met by Mary, who did an excellent job of telling us about the place and the surrounding areas including some great wineries.

The place was tidy and clean and well equipped. It is very large and comfortable. As the pictures show, it's in a beautiful setting."
5289072,86291619,2016-07-15,57681208,Ingrid,Phil was there to greet us when we arrived and helped us via a phone call when we got lost! He had the fire going and gave us some helpful advice about some of the local wineries

The property is wonderful; beautiful views and very comfortable, so much so that we felt no need to leave during our stay...and we probably wouldn't have, had the attractions of the Barossa not been so accessible. We will definitely return!"
5289072,95667019,2016-08-20,30737133,Han,Phil was very friendly and prompt in all his communications. The place was exactly as is in the pictures!  views and surrounds were beautiful. Gorgeous property and a very good price for the Barossa. Wouldn't definite stay here again!
5289072,99119239,2016-09-03,6470019,Eric,"We had a great stay! Phil made us feel very welcome. The location was very picturesque and peaceful but also quite close to Angaston, great restaurants and wineries. The house facilities were great and very cosy with the wood burning stove. "
5289072,101155766,2016-09-12,71621807,Sharyn,"Raspberry Farm is a stunning location. Guests are met with magical views across the valley, an abundance of bird and wild life and an utter sense of tranquility.

The house itself is very comfortable, tastefully designed and well equipped with everything you may need for a getaway. "
5289072,103883232,2016-09-24,11491693,Jacquie,"We arrived on Monday afternoon and were met by Mary who welcomed us and showed us around her lovely home.   The home was so clean, fresh and very warm with the log fire going.  Our host was always quick to get back to us with any questions we had, and his directions to get there were spot on. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook each night, everything was easy to find. The farm was a lovely base to come back to as we toured around the Barossa or just going for long walks during the day.  Evenings were spent around the fabulous dining table where our family just spent the night talking away, it really felt like home.  We really did get value for money and this is a place that we would love to return to one day and it was sad to leave on the Saturday. It really was a perfect place for the six of us just to enjoy, relax and spend time together. Our family wholeheartedly recommends staying at the Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm.  Thanks to Phillip and Mary."
5289072,111330979,2016-10-30,89786189,Jay,"This is a very spacious cabin suitated within a beautiful surroundings. Getting up in the morning and having breakfast at the dining table over looking the surroundings is a wonderful experience. There was a friendly kangeroo roaming in the yard too. If we werent so busy running around the Barossa visiting wineries, it would have been a wonderful place to have a relaxing slow day and have a BBQ and relax.
Phil was there waiting for us on time (we were 10min late) on the arrival date.
We are very pleased with the place"
5289072,112677958,2016-11-06,62999061,Laura,It was a lovely getaway with a lovely view and really enjoyed our stay. We stayed with another couple and there was plenty of space.  I would highly recommend this place to others. 
5289072,113277325,2016-11-11,60429440,Peter,Raspberry farm is set a short way up a dirt road in the idyllic BarossaValley. Mary met us and showed us the well set up house and fabulous kitchen. Everything was exactly as described including the beautiful views across the valley.

5289072,163469273,2017-06-24,74261839,Thuong,"Couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday with a small group of friends. We had three couples in total and we felt at home, surrounded by beautiful scenery and a fully catered to kitchen, which allowed us to cook our own meals. Other than the beautiful sounds of nature, there were no noisiness from passing cars or commuters. A highly recommended place for a quiet getaway. "

This cottage is set beautifully in the hills of the Barossa Valley, not far from a small town with nice restaurants and shops, and many, many vineyards! Also very close to the Collingrove Hill Climb Track. 

It is just as described, cosy and welcoming. It was lovely waking up to the sounds of wildlife. Highly recommend it!"
5289072,209228056,2017-11-04,130686574,Sara,If you are looking for a quiet retreat where the only sound is the birds tweeting and the sheep bleeting then look no further. A beautiful space with a wonderful panoramic valley view. Well appointed and equipped accommodation in easy reach of local amenities and the wonders of The Barossa. We will definitely be back!
5289072,211705443,2017-11-13,66505591,Larry,"Even If the star rating options were higher than those shown - we would score Philip and Mary’s place the max possible.
The attention to detail and the amenities offered are truly above and beyond.
Everything is so close to Mt Mckenzie that any Drive to wineries even the ‘far’ ones like Seppeltsfield or Wolf Blass are only ~15-20mins away. 
There is nothing a traveler could want for by staying at this wonderful log cabin which is so cosy and yet so spacious with more than enough accommodation for a family of 5 or 3 couples. 
Cannot reccomend Rasberry Farm high enough

Thanks again to Philip and Mary - excellent hosts"

It was perfect to bring our overseas visitors to and to come home to after busy days exploring the Barossa. Everything we needed was there and we easily self catered each evening. The ability to be outside, walk, hear the birds and lambs, pick a lemon of the tree, and just be, was awesome. A perfect getaway space in close proximity to all we wanted to do. We hope to be back.

Our hosts ensured we were able to find the house, waited for us to arrive in the evening with the lights on and heater going. The bottle of wine from their own small vineyard, was an unexpected touch and greatly appreciated by the wine drinkers in our group. The kitchen was stocked with useful items, like herbs and spices, milk, jams and sauces etc. A big collection of DVDs and CDs to handle anybody's taste. Lots of towels.

The house is absolutely stunning and particularly snug with a toasty fire to keep you warm if you happen to stay on a particularly rainy weekend (like we did). We had six people in our group and felt like there was lots of space for everyone to do their own thing, whether it was cooking, playing card games, reading or watching a film. The wonderful little extras that we found in the house made our stay truly memorable. Cannot wait to come back again and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to stay somewhere magical in the Barossa."

The kids loved the Yabbies from the dam, the adults loved the peace and beauty.

Make sure you get advice from Chris on food and wine!!  It was like having our own personal concierge."
5319590,32020852,2015-05-12,26195321,Jai,We had a lovely time in this beautiful quite warm inviting home. It was just like having our own place with all the amenities left for us. Nothing to organise except just getting there. Can't wait to escape up for the weekend again

Second to none! The house was exactly as photographed if not better and she was generous in what she provided for us in terms of food and drinks. The wine tasting she arranged was fabulous and all her dining suggestions excellent. Although I'm a local Adelaidian, Christine's  home is in a part of the valley I hadn't explored and now love. We will certainly book again and look forward to it. Christine certainly gives Airb'n'b hosts a great name!! "
5319590,33797377,2015-06-01,30870837,Elizabeth,"Our welcome by Christine was warm and inviting. A lovely home to stay in with much character and history but with all the modern elements you require.

Christine was warm and welcoming, we would have loved for her to have stayed and joined us for a glass of wine around the wood-burner. Her country home was an utter retreat for us - lots of tea and hearty breakfast to set-us up for our winter wine tasting; then home at night for warm chats in the lounge. "
5319590,40908182,2015-08-03,3809345,Georgia,"The listing doesn't convey the warmth, character and charm of this place. A wonderful stay, highly recommended."
5319590,41948103,2015-08-10,72978,Mandy,"Once again a wonderful home away from home. Christine is so generous with the goodies she leaves and the quiet, natural  surrounds are such a breath of fresh air. Just hope it doesn't become so popular I can't book it again!! "

The house and land was absolutely beautiful with great views in all directions! "
5319590,44136130,2015-08-24,36782644,Zamina,"Christine's place was the perfect getaway for our family with two kids aged 2 and 4.5. We came to the Barossa to do some rock climbing in the neighbouring Kaiserstuhl Conservation Park. Christine's place was excellently located for this and the drives into the main towns were also really easy.

She greeted us on arrival and had the fire going. Her property is beautifully maintained with picturesque views across the valley. The kids loved playing up and down the hill!

Inside all amenities and provisions were impeccable and it made us feel like we were staying at home. The warmth and charm is a testament to the comforts Christine has provided and organised.

Another reason we chose to stay at Christine's was her combustion fire, as we sorely missed having one at our home this winter. (Thank you for all the firewood Christine!)

We would happily stay here again. Relaxing, homely and rejuvenating - exactly the kind of holiday we look for.

Thanks again for sharing your place with us."
5319590,45984960,2015-09-07,12491847,Vanessa,"The house and property is amazing, we enjoyed everything about it. Christine was such a perfect host and her hospitality was unbelievable!

5319590,49600907,2015-10-05,30560543,Natalie,Christine and her cute dogs gave us a very warm welcome when we arrived.  The house is lovely with some outdoor areas to sit and enjoy the sunset filtering through the trees.  Indoors you have three nice (large) double bedrooms.  Set in the countryside we all enjoyed the views of rolling green hills/vines and the occasional sound of nearby sheep.  Make sure you get the number for the local taxi service and book ahead as they can be quite busy.  Christine was also able to recommend a local tour service that we really enjoyed.
5319590,51432167,2015-10-20,13876435,Yvette,"We had a lovely 3 night stay at Christine's place, she met us on our first day and showed us around and even sat down for a drink with us and gave some suggestions about wineries and restaurants worth visiting. The home is very relaxing with lovely views (tables, chairs, lounges on 3 sides of the house so you can have a different view every day :) and the breakfast supplies provided were enjoyed overlooking the vines. Bacon, eggs, mushrooms and sourdough bread with juice and some lovely teas.
Very comfortable beds and a positive vibe made this place a winner. 
Visitors should definitely check out Harvest Kitchen @ Artisans restaurant and 1918 restaurant. 
Thanks Christine!
p.s. thanks for the cleanskin wine!"
5319590,52212677,2015-10-27,3013845,Jordana,"It was such a beautiful home and setting for our weekend away in the Barossa. Chris provided delicious breakfast food, fruit and other essentials which made our stay just that bit easier and more enjoyable. She gave us some great tips for places to eat, shops to explore and wineries to visit which we were grateful for as there is so much to choose from in the Barossa. The home itself was very comfortable and just what we needed for our relaxing time away from the city. The view over the vines and hills from the table outside was perfect for wine and cheese in the afternoon. The house was also very well placed to easily get around the main towns, sites and wineries. I would highly recommend this as a perfect place to stay to explore and enjoy the Barossa. "

One of Christine's suggestions was to check out Kaiserstuhl Conservation park which is only 5 minutes away.

I didn't get chance to meet Chris directly, but she was super nice to the other guests who checked in and was great to communicate with via text. She gave us everything we needed, and went above and beyond to help us out.

We were three couples staying in the house to attend a wedding in Lyndoch. There was plenty of room for all six of us to be comfortable and hang out together in the lounge or out on the balcony enjoying the valley views. The kitchen was big enough for us to cook a couple of nice meals for everyone at the property.

The location is convenient but secluded, and we were able to get to local towns in the Barossa within 30 mins.

Would live to stay again sometime. Thanks Chris!"

The Barossa is great for amazing wine tasting and great food. Thank you again Christine!"

Christine was there to meet us on the day to show us around and was very responsive when we needed help. Fridge was fully stocked with breakfast supplies and I had a wonderful time cooking for my family in her kitchen.

The kitchen was well-equipped and Christine generously left plenty of supplies from bread to bacon and eggs! Christine also shared with us passionately about the Barossa - we had fantastic pizza dinner in Angaston thanks to her recommendation!

The location was also perfect - it is just a short 7-10 minutes drive to the nearby wineries, and was a little spot of heaven.

Chris is a gorgeous and thoughtful host. The kitchen was stocked with ample breakfast supplies just for us including delicious bread. We loved its off-the-beaten track feel, but still not too far away from the centre of the Barossa. If you're going mid-winter know there is a wood fire stove to keep you warm in the living room and heaters in the bedrooms and bathroom, plus electric blankets, but it's an old house so still chilly getting from room to room. Also the lovely bedroom at the front of the house faces east and the curtains are not block out so be prepared to wake with the sunrise or bring an eye mask if light bothers you. Great comfy beds and pillows though! Netflix and other extras like little chocolates on the bedside tables are thoughtful touches. We had a great weekend and would definitely recommend."

Christine’s place is on a scenic vineyard with stunning views across the valley. 
A short taxi ride into the main towns of Angaston, Nuriootpa or Tanunda if you want to explore wineries then this is a must for your home base. 
It’s warm and cozy, the wood fire was lit when we arrived, fridge and cupboards stocked with essentials, and a lovely bottle of red waiting for us made from the very grapes we looked out upon, by Christine’s sons own hand. 
Everything you could possibly want and more. 
Christine’s a magnificent host and Tarrah Mohr is straight out of an episode of Outlander."
5319590,266371897,2018-05-20,177719563,Kym,A beautiful house in a very beautiful setting. Close to loads of great wineries and wonderful places to eat. Chris provides everything you could want for a comfortable cozy stay and was there to greet us and show us around even though we arrived later than expected. We only wish we could have stayed longer.

We had a fantastic weekend away due to staying at one of the best places the Barossa has to offer. We woke up to a spectacular sunrise over the hills and finished the nights with local cheese and wine in front of the toasty fire. Everything we could ever need was provided and Chris was a wonderful host, meeting us at the house and showing us around and answering any questions. 

I would definitely recommend Tarroh Mhoh to anyone and everyone in future."

5319590,345377899,2018-11-04,5052601,Verity,"We had a delightful stay at Christine's place which is a proper home from home thanks to the thoughtful touches. The cottage is located in a stunning spot on a vineyard with views over the Flaxman Valley. When we arrived we found freshly cut roses from the lovely garden in the rooms and a fridge stacked full of essentials and some lovely treats including local bacon and eggs from the hens that live in the garden.

The cottage itself was exceptionally clean and is decorated like a real home with some beautiful furniture. The kitchen was great to cook in and there were multiple places outdoors to eat. The beds were luxurious and comfortable, as was the living space and it was great to have Netflix set up on the TV.

A fantastic stay and we would love to stay again."
5319590,346477662,2018-11-08,45175221,Bernie,Christine is a friendly host. She loaded the fridge with goodies and gave us great local information to help the experience. Her home is sufficiently away from town to be a farm experience but close enough to shops and eateries to be accessible. We would return.
5319590,348443145,2018-11-13,8095532,Joy,"Christine is an incredibly helpful and welcoming host, and Tarrah Mhor is a truly unique and stunning property.

Christine was very helpful in connect ing us to local tour guides ahead of our visit and suggested things to do, like the wonderful Barossa Farmers Market in Angaston. You’re just a short drive from Tanunda and lots of local wineries, shops and the Barossa Sculpture Park. In fact, nothing is very far away at all. It was cool at night but we had plenty of extra blankets if we needed them. The kitchen is fully equipped for making meals. The property was spacious for our group of 5 and there is an outdoor area with festoon lights for warmer evenings. I’d highly recommend this gem!"
5319590,352877688,2018-11-26,107606313,Lisa,"Tarrrah Mor is everything you could expect is this beautiful area. Chris made us feel welcome from start to finish and was always happy to answer any questions we had. 
Her beautiful home sits atop a stunning area with views from every angle. 
The rooms are all large and beautifully furnished and the beds are all extremely comfortable with quality linens and bedding.   It was the small touches like fresh bread waiting on our arrival and fresh flowers for us to enjoy that added to our experience. 
Thank you for allowing us to live like a local in your beautiful home and we can’t wait to return."

From the front porch, the sunrise was magnificent to see! The house is very clean and comfortable and has everything you need.

The house is very thoughtfully renovated and decorated old cottage with blends of old and new in every room. Modern kitchen with more supplies than we needed for our stay - bread, butter, milk, juice, tea, coffee and more! Very spacious bedrooms! Beds are comfortable with good quality linen. We spent hours on charming veranda and outdoor area simply sitting, chatting and enjoying the atmosphere away from all hussles. Our time together, these lazy conversations while overlooking the vines will stay in our memory for life! We also visited few places around the area. The house is just a short drive from vineyards, shops and eating places. Overall, we totally enjoyed our stay! A perfect weekend spent with family!"

Ample provisions, delightful slow combustion fire and lots of TV viewing options.  We stayed there with another couple and it was perfect.  15mins from Tanunda or Angaston but the distance meant isolation and a truly rural experience."
5319590,448174447,2019-05-05,109374130,Lachlan,An amazing home set amongst the hills with amazing views. The home is a beautiful country get away that you wont want to leave. Chris is a fantastic host that was very helpful and accomodating. We will be back for sure!

5319590,539751814,2019-10-02,202366140,Reg,"ABSOLUTELY AMAZING STAY. Could not have been better. LOVED EVERYTHING. The property was awesome, the location so peaceful and beautiful, but within easy reach of Barossa and Eden Valleys and beyond. 
Plentiful provisions for breakfast. Beautiful food including organic cereals, coffees, large selection of teas including organic, herbal and T2. Also with the most delicious orange juice, fresh creamy milk and the yummiest fresh country style bread to make the most delectable smashed avocado toast. Best enjoyed on the amazing front porch. Every detail thought of. Beautiful linens, super comfortable beds and furniture! Even the shampoo, conditioner and body washes were luxe.
We loved every minute! Beautiful chickens (only if you want to interact with them - one of us was not a chicken fan until he met ‘the ladies’. Was quite taken by how sweet they are!) and sheep grazing on the property. Even goldfish in the pond. Christine’s place is as close as it gets to heaven. We will definitely return!"
5319590,542959782,2019-10-06,78721681,Jorge,"We had the most enjoyable stay and couldn’t believe how good the place is! The house is beautiful, comfortable and surrounded by lovely gardens and vineyards with pretty views in all directions. We had a great sleep with the sounds of nature and without any noise or artificial light around, feeling rested next day and waking up to spectacular sunrises in this very peaceful setting.
 
The host is also marvellous! There was beautiful breakfast provisions in the fridge, good coffee and tea, tasty jams, milk, bread, just incredible! Everything works well in the house and it is much more that you can see from the photos.
 
We feel so lucky to have found this place and have decided to make it our place-to-go in the region. Definitely coming back and of course 100% recommended."

The hosts have thought of everything. Only 15 minutes to practically everywhere you’d like to go."

Living space is well thought, with 3 big bedrooms, each housing a nice queen size bed (They are very very comfortable).

Best place to stay in Barossa!"

The view of the vineyards at 6 in the morning watching the sun rise over the hills will be a memory I'll have with me forever. Even more special that it was my wedding morning.

They mention that could happen though. Not too far from wineries & other points of interest, host was easy to talk to, we had a great time"
5319590,581461000,2019-12-24,102462650,Victoria,"Chris is probably one of the kindest people I’ve met. Her response time is fast, and her tips for exploring the Barossa Valley were super helpful, check-in instructions were communicated timely and clearly. Her place was absolutely beautiful and I loved every moment of spending time on the property. This is definitely somewhere you want to stay, and sad when it is time to leave."

It is about 15-20mins drive to nearest towns. It’s easy to buy foods to cook or just grab something to eat in the town. Not far from all the wineries. It was beautiful drive."

Chris was a wonderful host, communication was fast and
Check-in was a breeze.

Chris has a lot of helpful information of the area in the home which was handy.

Sitting outside on a lovely day was something we looked forward to every day and with her 2 very friendly chickens made us feel so at home. 

This place is very quiet and if you like cooking then this is a kitchen you would want to use..

Thanks Chris for a lovely stay and we would recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing time in the wineries..

I’ll will be back for sure.."
5319590,604618496,2020-02-11,37622898,Phil,"Lots of space inside and out, great kitchen and BBQ, good location close to a small cellar door and nature reserve and a short drive to Barossa’s main attractions. Christine and her son were both very friendly and checked up to ensure we were ok during our stay. We stayed 5 nights but could comfortably have stayed longer - if you’re looking for a place to relax after a long journey to Australia it’s ideal."
5319590,606115852,2020-02-16,168478230,Alex,Christine's place is in such a peaceful area it really is very relaxing.

5319590,613428427,2020-03-01,20183727,Marion,"A gorgeous home where you can watch the sun fade over a glass of Barossa wine on the back porch. Comfy beds and a feeling of welcome inside the home whispers relaxation to anyone who stays. Chickens will supplement your breakfast and vistas of vines and natural beauty are all around you. A handy location yet feeling away from it all. Christine is a fabulous host and she works hard at making you feel completely at home. We would return again for sure.

Andrew is a friendly, helpful host with a great knowledge of the local area. Andrew and Belinda were happy to provide anything extra I needed. As I was their first guest, they were still putting the final touches to the accommodation. Andrew's place was good value for money, especially for a budget conscious traveller."
5426792,55833823,2015-12-06,38514360,Alex,Friendly & generous host.  All needs were met with ease. Perfect for the Traveller or for business. Will be back.

We only stayed for one night when we went to 'a day on the green' and what do you need the most? A comfy bed for a good nights sleep - and that's what we had. In the morning we discovered that the fridge had fresh fruit and milk (the things we needed for breakfast) and a host of other options. Recommend if you need good clean friendly accomodation."
5426792,58942435,2016-01-05,20462909,Nicole,"Andrew and family were lovely! Friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. Located in the heart of the Barossa, the separate backyard unit had everything we needed during our stay. Would definitely stay here again! "
5426792,71407982,2016-04-25,16161274,Ai-Ping,"Andrew and Belinda were both very welcoming and friendly. Their room had everything my partner and I needed and we felt very comfortable there during our stay. On top of that, we had a lot of privacy because it was a separate building from the house. 

We were visiting the Barossa for the weekend and we found that all the places we wanted to visit were only 15 minute drives away, which made getting around very convenient. If we visit the barossa again, we will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!

"
5426792,72037336,2016-04-30,11313730,Penny,"Andrew was very friendly and helpful, even showing me the way to a meeting the day before so I wouldn't get lost on the day. Close to town too.
The shed was just as you see it on the web and the only thing that I would have liked would have been a little outdoor sitting space. Otherwise I would recommend this accommodation.
Thanks Andrew"
5426792,74349137,2016-05-15,53524879,Josh,"The accommodation was great. Immaculate, great facilities, and friendly hosts. Would happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. Central location in the Barossa too! "

5426792,91985753,2016-08-07,70618836,Barb,"I really appreciated staying at Andrew and Belinda's because it was totally private, and suited me. My stay was 2 x longer term stays. I found Andrew very helpful, and Belinda made sure I had clean sheets and towels weekly. 
The area is very nice, and is close to Linear Park, which was lovely for walks, even in the wintertime. "
5426792,93389399,2016-08-12,85057470,Annette,"Comfortable overnight stay. Very suitable for my requirements.
Thank you"
5426792,101836544,2016-09-15,14604779,Barbara,"Stayed one very cold night. No electric blankets but Andrew did have the room heated prior to our arrival. No crockery or proper cutlery and an antique pantry/meat safe was not appropriate in the sleeping area. Overall, we left awfully early as we were not going to drink tea/coffee from plastic cups."
5426792,102341951,2016-09-17,24986439,Alice,"These are hosts that really care. The accommodation is simple but very comfortable and caters for any needs you might have. The room, kitchenette and bathroom were all very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was the little things that really made the stay great though. The towels and face washers were folded and arranged neatly on the bed, the end of the toilet paper was folded into a triangle and a list of useful numbers (such as where to get the best pizza) was provided. Further from this, the greeting was warm, friendly and sincere and the hosts made themselves very easy to contact if there was any need. I felt like a cherished guest, being welcomed into their home and will definitely be back."
5426792,113040678,2016-11-09,100726963,Paul,"Andrew & Belinda made us feel really welcome.  Everything was set up ready for our arrival, and they had been in contact with us promptly on booking.  A very smooth stay - top hospitality.  Everything was clean and tidy.  It was also great fun staying in a garage conversion - exactly as described."
5426792,113458999,2016-11-12,7000014,Thibaut,"Well located in the centre of the Barossa Valley, we were welcomed by Andrew and started our exploration nicely. The shed was good and clean. Unfortunately, we had a lot of wind and rain and you can hear it during the night. A little minus point was a bit of insects around but didn't bother us too much. "
5426792,114985005,2016-11-21,76521547,Emily,"We stayed with Andrew and Belinda for one night. The converted garage room was self contained, comfortable and private. As our stay was short so we didn't meet Belinda but Andrew was friendly and accommodating. A great place to stay if you would like to spend a few days exploring SA's beautiful Barossa Valley."
5426792,117110331,2016-12-04,74548150,Andrew,"Well place in the centre of Nuriootpa, was a good place to base myself for the wedding that I was attending.  "
5426792,121172954,2016-12-14,23835467,Mary,"Andrew and Belinda are fabulous hosts who will bend over backwards to make your stay as comfortable as possible.

Thank you Andrew and Belinda!"

5426792,153357192,2017-05-21,23174829,Richard,"With such a quirky description we did not know what to expect - but it was as described. A B&B in a shed! Once inside we forgot that. Plenty of room, comfortable bed, good bathroom and well equipped kitchen.

Andrew and Belinda are warm friendly people and true to their nature they provided a comprehensive do-it-yourself breakfast. Great value and we will return!"
5426792,161403490,2017-06-18,97930530,Gerlinde,"Andrew and Belinda a very friendly hosts. The room was very clean and welcoming. We loved the breakfast they left for us, very much appreciated. Overall very good value for money."

Their cosy queen size seperate from the main house accommodation is well fitted with heating/cooling, small kitchenette and seperate bathroom with adjustable hot water temperature. It's about a 10-15mim walk into the shops/restaurants and on a lovely quiet residential street. Highly recommended"
5426792,189836149,2017-09-03,20476517,Koen,"Lovely place in the heart of the Barossa. The place is nicely set-up, very clean and all is provided for (good private space, nice breakfast, clean towels and linen). Andrew and Belinda are great hosts, always up for a chat and providing great tips and places to visit in the region. From their place it's a short walk to the Vine Inn, great restaurant for dinner at a reasonable price. It is also a strategic location to visit the wineries in the Barossa Valley.

We will definitely recommend their place to fellow travelers and we will book it again for our next trip to the Barossa!"
5426792,193266277,2017-09-13,59553932,Mark & Dianne,Very comfortable accommodation in an excellent location. A very warm welcome from Andrew had us settled in quickly. The facilities were ideal for our requirements and we would be happy to stay again.

Good shower pressure, a comfy bed and some food there for breakfast - muesli, bread, fruit and water. Air conditioning keeps the place as warm or cool as needed. Great location in the heart of Nuriootpa. Close to all amenities. Wifi can be a tad touch and go with reception. A great place to stay overall. Thank you!"

5426792,205055379,2017-10-21,96712465,David,"Simple but fantastic accommodation. Andrew was extremely helpful and accommodating. He made regular contact leading up to ensure I knew exactly what the arrangements were. Kitchen has a bar fridge, single pot/pan induction hot plate, microwave, kettle and toaster. Great heating and cooling in the bedroom if needed (although is well insulated), with a sizeable TV and comfy queen bed. Bathroom and all areas were spotless. Would definitely use again and highly recommend. Can’t ask for any more at this bargain price."

The perfumed bed linen.. we were so comfortable after a day in the car going around wineries. 
Breakfast provided, yummy muffins, yogurt as well as tea and coffee. Great privacy but closed from the host when needed. 
Andrew was so hospitable, he even offered us a bottle of wine from the winery he works at we didn’t had a chance to visit ! 
Thanks for a very short but very great stay !"

5426792,357314312,2018-12-10,5808248,Andrew,"The description is pretty clear - it's a shed at the back of a house on a quiet road in Nuriootpa. The centre of Nuriootpa is easily walkable from the house, but from anywhere in Nuriootpa you'll need a car or a taxi to get to Tanunda or our dinner destination Hently Farm.

The shed has everything you need for a couple - really good aircon; a nice light and airy bathroom; a fridge for storing wine, milk and water; and good stable wifi. There is a cupboard full of crockery, cutlery and glassware. It's not designed to cook in but you could happily have a deli platter, light breakfast or takeaway meal there."

5426792,412964894,2019-02-16,122929220,Andrew,You will find an extraordinary host in Andrew (we didn't meet Belinda).  Andrew went out of his way to make sure that our overnight stay was everything and more.  The accommodation is small but had everything we needed and is set in a very quiet location in Nuriootpa.

Andrew knocked on the door in the evening to check everything was okay and also to give me the heads up that he was lighting the BBQ nearby, if I wanted to throw anything on. I thought that was very polite!  Quick responders, especially at late notice. 

The only negative was a relatively constant smell of cigarette smoke coming through the window in the evening, I’m not a smoker so it was rather unpleasant."

Great location and great shed - a lot bigger and better than we expected! We loved having our own space that felt like a studio apartment with somewhere to park and all the amenities available to cook our own breakfasts and dinners if we fancied. Highly recommend!
5426792,708854021,2020-11-14,101681575,Scott,"Andrew and Belinda's shed is pretty amazing. From the outside... It's a shed. Walk inside and it is a cozy room with a comfy bed, nice tv and kick ass aircon. The place was very clean and well equipped.
Andrew and Belinda could not have been nicer. Their communication leading up to my stay including check instructions was fantastic and when I met them, they were very friendly and even invited me to have a beer with them. I like beer so of course I accepted. :)"

While Andrew and Belinda’s backyard shedhaus doesn’t include any of the fine luxurious touches you see in hotels, the place has tonnes of DIY charm and had absolutely everything we could ever want for our cycling trip around the Barossa. Andrew is so friendly and willing to help offer advice. We thoroughly enjoyed grabbing a beer with him and Belinda on our last night. Thanks for the stay!"

The cottage itself was spacious, clean and felt very luxurious. Highly recommend catching sunset at the light monument gazebo on the property (one of the best sunsets we’ve seen!). We also enjoyed tennis on the professional court and star gazing. 
Located within the Barossa region with plenty of vineyards and restaurants nearby, recommend St Hugo’s and Musque.
Wish we had of stayed longer than the 2 nights but look forward to returning. 
Thanks Nelly"

The property was perfect, beautifully decorated, super clean and new and lots of privacy. My friend and I were sad to leave. Also great breakfast from the local cafe which Julie provides $20 daily vouchers for. Highly recommend Barossa Barn! "
6157653,42869084,2015-08-16,15463417,Andy,"Lovely location. Friendly and discrete owners.
Nice and warm inside during cold Barossa winter!"
6157653,49635430,2015-10-05,24532455,Michelle,"We had a lovely stay in the Barossa at Julie's converted barn.  Well equipped and spacious, beautifully decorated (love a chandelier in a bathroom!) and gorgeous gardens.  

While there are limited cooking facilities, this is amply compensated by vouchers for breakfast each day at a local cafe in Angaston.  (Breakfast is served until 3pm and the servings are huge!)

Julie does note in her listing that the bathroom in on the lower level, with master bed/living space upstairs.  This wasn't problematic for us, however the stairs are quite steep so property wouldn't suit someone with mobility issues.  

Thanks for a delightful stay."
6157653,53265739,2015-11-07,4368878,Peter,"We were greeted by Julie and welcomed to the Barossa Barn. The first impression was WOW. The photos don't do justice to the warm and sophisticated feeling of this listing. We had a fantastic stay. Julie & Neil have thought of everything, lots of information, great facilities, a most comfortable bed, even Foxtel with all the HD movie channels etc. The breakfast vouchers were also excellent, entitling us to a delicious cooked breakfast at a nearby cafe. The location was also excellent. A perfect centre point to our daily excursions around the Barossa wineries. Special mention: try to have dinner at Ferment Asian. A delightful experience with 5 star service."
6157653,54092062,2015-11-16,39560375,Amy,Everything about our stay at Barossa Barn was perfect! The location was great and the accommodations very charming as well as the local breakfast cafe and our wonderful hosts. We would highly recommend a stay here if you are planning a visit to the Barossa. Julie and Neil even helped us with planning our itinerary and dining options. This mini-vacation could not have been better for us!
6157653,54622453,2015-11-22,47796153,Coralee,"Julie our host welcomed us on arrival, showed us to her unique beautiful B@B it was as described on line so charming, convenient comfortable to all the Barossa.

6157653,55259063,2015-11-29,12146271,Andrea,Lovely accomodation in a peaceful and very handy area of the Barossa. Every comfort you could wish for and exceptionally clean and welcoming. We spent two nights at the barn and could have spent longer if we had more time. Breakfast included at the local cafe was great as was the free wifi. Highly recommend!
6157653,67492802,2016-03-29,56120503,Angela,"My partner and I enjoyed a quiet weekend at the Barossa Barn. The accommodation is a bit of comfort in a rustic setting. Julie and Neil were busy gardening on their lovely property when we arrived. The house (converted barn) is set up with 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and toilet downstairs, and large open room upstairs with a queen bed, living area and efficiency-type kitchen. There is a small balcony off the top of the stairs that overlooks the garden.

The bed was very comfy, with high quality sheets. We were able to make coffee in the morning with the kettle and french press provided. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, cutlery, and glasses, and supplies for tea and coffee. We enjoyed a picnic dinner one evening with the spoils of our trip to the Barossa Farmer’s Market and the Barossa Cheese Company, both of which are just down the road. There’s plenty of cutting boards and knives for the cheeses, breads and mettwurst! Lovely to be able to enjoy a real taste of the region, and I really do strongly recommend a visit to Farmer's Market during your stay. We did not take advantage of the breakfasts supplied at the local cafe, as we were either getting an early start out to the wineries or sleeping in.

The nights were perfectly quiet and we slept soundly. The location is semi-suburban. They are the outer edge of a residential neighbourhood as it transitions into farmland. Angaston was a lovely little township about 2km away, and there is plenty to eat and drink nearby. It’s a nice area for strolling. We took a taxi one evening for a special dinner so that we could enjoy the wine. 

All in all a very pleasant, relaxing stay— wish we could have stayed longer, and would definitely stay again. Wonderful location for a good food and wine weekend!"
6157653,75727197,2016-05-22,43325498,Damien,"The place was beautiful and Julie was more than accommodating, even providing a complimentary bottle of wine because of a faulty TV! Highly recommended."

6157653,102306916,2016-09-17,32650070,Louise,Great B&B.  Very comfortable and clean.  Having foxtel and wifi included was great and loved the complimentary port and chocolates.  Julie was a very helpful host.  Highly recommend.

6157653,263022195,2018-05-11,152550529,Chris,A beautiful spot in a cozy cottage. Julie is an excellent host; great service and advice for sightseeing. Neat and tiny; an old building with history with modern amenities for comfort.
6157653,266292875,2018-05-19,26397239,Sarah,"My husband and I booked The Barn for our first visit to the Barossa. We wanted a unique space to stay for 2 nights that was central to the wine tasting action - and this location is perfect! Check in was seamless - Julie texted me the key code so we could let ourselves in to the property. It was chilly when we arrived, however,  the air-con acts as a heater and kept us warm all weekend. 

We were very impressed by the space and the thoughtful touches from Julie - wine tasting map and information, details on local activities and things to do (such as the Saturday morning Farmer's Market - unmissable!), a tasty Port for after dinner and other special touches. 

The kitchen only has a microwave, so we ate out one evening and bought curries from the Farmer's Market to heat up the next evening. The bathroom is beautiful with an amazing claw foot tub I enjoyed an aromatherapy bath in. The stairs up to the main area are narrow and sloping, so it's not recommended for people with mobility issues as the bathroom and toilet are downstairs. Julie supplies Foxtel as the local channels are limited. We found the bed too hard for our liking, however, we prefer a very soft bed, so this is purely personal preference. 

Overall, highly recommended for location, space and comfort. Thanks, Julie!"
6157653,628426040,2020-06-08,242597904,Mikayla,"Exceeded our expectations! We will definitely recommend this bnb to those we know.

The Barn made our Barossa valley trip really memorable and we hope to be back again soon and will be recommending it to our friends. thanks again Julie!!"

Great location for visiting neighbouring wineries  - some within a 5 minute walk from Little Para -  and the town centre of Tanunda.  Would highly recommend.

The outside space was particularly impressive, with interesting, eclectic and creative objects, and lots of segmented seating areas for afternoon drinks, breakfast or anything in between.  It was also a very private space, and we felt very much at home here.  The bed was very comfortable and whilst it was a bit dark inside the house, this worked well for the hot days, as did the airconditioner.  If you want to visit the Barossa for a period of time, this is a perfect place to stay as it's a great location, right on the edge of town with a fabulous restauraunt at one end of the street, and numerous wineries at the other, all within walking distance.

It is very quiet and private, and has a gorgeous garden full of well tended succulents and other plants and lots of sweet seating nooks and options.
The cottage is clean and well equipped, and the bed is really comfortable - my husband said he had his first really good ""sleep-in"" for some time!
Wendy is a thoughtful host and clear and responsive communicator.
We would certainly go again."
6170279,235230278,2018-02-16,50157837,Romina,"I recently stayed at Wendy's cottage for a night, it was a beautiful space and Wendy was very hospitable. We informed her we would be arriving early due to doing a wine tour that started at 10am and asked if we could leave our rental car there, which she said was no problem. When we arrived, the previous guests had already left so Wendy was kind enough to let us leave our bags in the cottage garden and wait there until our tour car arrived. The space itself is gorgeous, had all the amenities we needed, a comfy bed and lovely garden area. It's very close to a few good wine/restaurant spots too. Thanks Wendy!"

On the same street as the Para wine trial, we were able to explore Peter Lehmann's and Langmire by foot.  Which means you don't have to worry about a designated driver.

Would recommend this place to others."
6170887,40950252,2015-08-03,15160525,Chloe,"The first time I have booked using airbnb and I am a convert thanks to the Elderton Wines Guest house. As a group of four girls from Melbourne and Perth we stayed here last weekend (the beginning of August). The house is in such a central location, it's specious and was a great space to stay in winter and we all could picture it being just as wonderful at any time of the year. We instantly felt at home.  The house could also comfortably sleep six people with three bedrooms and has all the facilities you might need. 

We were made to feel really welcome with a bottle of wine on our arrival and our host recommending restaurants and wineries to us before we arrived. When we come back to the Barossa we will most definitely stay here! "
6170887,45948275,2015-09-07,37290444,Alison,"The stay at Elderton Lodge was great, we received a warm welcome from Tush, the lodge was comfortable and convenient to all amenities.

We enjoyed tasting the wines at the tasting room and sharing a bottle kindly provided by the lodge.

Would recommend this to others wishing to explore the Barossa."
6170887,52217422,2015-10-27,41674703,Brendan,Elderton Wines lodge was a clean and comfortable house. It is well located within walking distance of most locations in Nuriootpa. The support at the cellar door was excellent and we enjoyed tasting the range of wines. Would recommend as a base to explore the Barossa region.
6170887,57889981,2015-12-30,47735914,Nemish,We loved our staying in Elderton Guest house. House is perfectly located near to all the shops and restaurants.  Best part was the park near by which kids enjoyed every day. I would say it is perfect place for small family of two adult and 2 kids to group of 4 to 5 adults.
6170887,60981555,2016-01-30,37530274,Jack,"What an amazing Place. Elderton guest house is the perfect base for exploring the Barossa. The house was close to the centre of Nuriootpa and right next door to the Elderton vineyard.

On arrival, a bottle of red and a bottle of white were awating for us in the house. The place was very clean and tidy with everything and more than you need. 

Tush thank you so much for being such an amazing host, and indulging us with a wine tasting. I recommend this to anyone who stays there. Tush is also a wealth of knowledge on what to explore in the area and also made us feel extremely welcome.

We will definitely be back.  
"

6170887,71199410,2016-04-24,33000424,Ken,"We were four guys enjoying a golf and wines experience. Communication leading up to our stay was terrific. Once there, everything was at or above expectation. We collected the keys from Elderton Cellar Door and enjoyed an excellent tasting session hosted by Tush (rhymes with ""rush"", of which there was none - but ""just don't call me Trish""). We learned from her and enjoyed her suggested wines.
All voted for a return next year.
"
6170887,79731516,2016-06-13,27806867,Megan,"Comfortable and cozy stay. Great location. Stayed here with 6 guests  (2 couples 2 friends ) and it was a good size, not too small. The hot water stayed hot for everyone and the heating kept the house warm. Nice complimentary touches that made our stay enjoyable.  Recommended to anybody. "
6170887,104829974,2016-09-28,2724177,Brittany,"Very close to all amenities and some amazing wineries. Check in was smooth and the guest house is actually on a seperate street (roughly 50m away) from the Cellar door, so you can enjoy some privacy.
There was 6 of us, and we had a fantastic stay at Elderton. Some nights spent enjoying the Barossa, and some cooking at home. Very enjoyable!
Thank you!"

6170887,137509794,2017-03-15,8442990,Stephen,"I stayed at Elderton house with my parents and partner for two nights as we visited the Barossa wine region. The house was in a great central but also nice and quiet location for visiting the nearby wineries and restaurants. The house is very nice with two full bedrooms, a kitchen and living room and very modern bathroom. The providing of continental breakfast supplies were great for feeding us in the mornings. 

The only hiccup during our stay was that the hot water heater was broken when we arrived. The hosts sent their maintenance people out the next morning to fix it which was excellent, unfortunately this meant we only had hot water for the last morning of our two night stay."
6170887,139140079,2017-03-23,27634546,Kimberley,"A group of 6 friends stayed here on our way to Clare for a wedding. The staff at Elderton were very welcoming.

The cottage was in amongst the wine district with vines in front of the cottage, but walking distance from Tanunda.  Tununda has a lovely village feel with boutique shops and cafes central to all the main attractions.  Cynthia was very welcoming the cottage was supper stocked with a breakfast feast and everything needed.  The retro deco was very impressive with lots of treasures, also so fab cook books to browse.

Breakfast food was delicious and generous (cooking provisions as well as more mundane) along with a lovely bottle of wine.

Thorough information pack gave us heaps of info on the area and the best spots to eat whilst in the region. 

Very well organised; host was away but made regular contact prior to our arrival to ensure arrangements for key and housing were all in order.

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a spot to stay."
6296823,51033545,2015-10-17,28320151,Lynn,We had a wonderful time staying at Veritas cottage. Cynthia left us provisions for breakfast which were much appreciated. The cottage had everything we needed and we particularly enjoyed the outdoor patio with views over the vineyards.

6296823,52507519,2015-10-30,45125640,Jen,"Great location and a cute, quirky house.  The breakfast spread was amazing with eggs from the chook pen on the property.

The hosts did a wonderful job stocking it just right and thinking through what we would need. On our last day, we cooked eggs laid by the chickens my daughter visited earlier.

And there's nothing like having a vintner as your landlord while you're in the area tasting wine :)

Highly recommend!"

6296823,110833926,2016-10-28,99153392,Matthew,"Don't be fooled by the 1980's build as this place has immense charm, abundant good taste and a great layout. Secluded and private but also in a perfect position for exploring the valley. Surrounded by grapevines, native cypress and its own kitchen garden. Cynthia encouraged foraging so we grazed on fresh herbs, spinach, spring onions and asparagus. An ideal experience; a microcosm of the broader growers valley itself. Rolf and Cynthia are generous hosts and the breakfast provisions, wine and facilities were terrific. We only had a few days, but a meal at FermentAsian was sublime and by the time we dined at Hentley Farm, reality was slipping as the euphoria was overtaking us. A perfect break and Veritas cottage was so central to it all in more ways than one. A brilliant place to stay. Thanks."

The check in & communication with our host Cynthia at all times was super-easy. There were a number of small touches that really made the cottage excellent, including ample food for breakfasts, local information, complimentary bottle of wine and an honesty bar with extra wine if you run out. The air conditioning was a must for us (we spent Christmas Day here at 40 degree heat, so that was essential). 

There is one other property nearby but the cottage feels extremely private. There is a nice little patio area with chairs & a table looking out onto the vines. "

6296823,149998119,2017-05-06,10513702,Tom,"Cynthia greeted us just after we arrived and made us feel very welcome in her cosy rental cottage. We cooked a meal in the well-equipped kitchen one night of our stay. We had dinner at a great restaurant in town on the other. The place was everything we needed for our short stay in the Barossa.

If you're wanting self catering and quiet accommodation on the outskirts of Tanunda, with a super-friendly host who goes the distance on customer service, then this is the place for you."
6296823,159382259,2017-06-11,56314903,Lucy,"Loved our stay at veritas cottage. The cottage was perfect, a retro feel, in a beautiful garden setting. Cynthia and Rolf were extremely hospitable. Just look inside their fridge for eg. Eggs bacon sausages fruit yogurt bread OJ - you name it. Very cosy clean and in a perfect spot when touring around the barossa valley- tasting all the beautiful wines. Rolf being his own winemaker - giving us a tour - tasting wines out of the barrell was a very personal touch. Thankyou. They also left us a bottle of their wine to enjoy. And their yummy port. Very fun hosts- allowing us to join their night. Definitly a must stay at the cottage- a peaceful getaway- and a must to go tasting at their cellar door. Beautiful wines. Some of the nicest in the Barossa. Cynthias communication was perfect prior- sharing tips for us. Thankyou to both of you. A perfect stay."
6296823,170575762,2017-07-16,51886076,Pamela,"What a delight. We based ourselves at Veritas cottage over my birthday weekend and it was perfect.

Lovely cottage, clean, and very homely. Also a complimentary bottle of wine, and some port from their winery! Good place to rest and relax. Cynthia is also very quick with any inquiries. Last but not least, do wine tasting at the cellar door, I love the wine! I would highly recommend this place. And I hope to come back for longer stay."
6296823,189792831,2017-09-03,20995027,Elena,"Rolf and Cynthia were fantastic hosts. We experienced a wonderful wine tasting and Cynthia was kind enough to give us a lift to the cottage afterwards. The cottage is lovely, decorated in 50s style and well located with great wineries nearby. The kitchen was packed with fresh produce, for a delicious breakfast. We recommend it to everyone and look forward to our next stay!"
6296823,195552286,2017-09-19,14703539,Stefania,"We loved our stay at the Veritas cottage, it's a beautiful, relaxing and quiet spot in the outskirt of Tanunda. Many restaurants and wineries are just a short drive away, two wineries are in walking distance.
Cynthia provided us with a generous supply of breakfast items, fruits, milk, cereals, jams, bacon and fresh eggs from her chickens. And a bottle of superb wine from the Rolf Binder winery - they make beautiful wines.
Absolutely outstanding is the hospitality of Cynthia and Rolf, they made us feel more than welcome and part of the family. We will be back!"
6296823,196619873,2017-09-23,60344542,Janet,"A delightful place to spend a weekend away.  The herb and vege gardens were great and there is a lovely spot to sit out the front and enjoy the bird-life and peaceful surrounds. Very tranquil. The interior is clean and unfussy, with hardwood floors throughout (big tick for those with allergies). And yes, those gorgeous retro lounge chairs you see in the photos are super comfy to sit in. Cynthia is a very caring host and her communication was excellent. Thank you Cynthia!"
6296823,220128975,2017-12-20,80620872,Fridrik,"Cynthia and Rolf are great hosts. From the start we booked with them, Cynthia was eager to assist us in booking activities and help us get the most of the visit.
Once there, they had arranged breakfast for us, ready in the kitchen, bottle of wine and we did some wine tasting at their winery and Rolf showed us part of their production site.
Very friendly and helpful. We highly recommend Cynthia and Rolf's place."

6296823,529556955,2019-09-15,1324190,Elan,"Cynthia and Rolf’s cosy cottage was everything you’d need for a stay in the Barossa. Brilliantly located just out of the throng of Tanunda and a short to medium stroll to some of the Barossa’s finest vineyards, this thoughtfully finished, welcoming home truly made our stay. Biggest of thanks to both of you guys for the delicious brekkie goods and a bottle of 2015 Shiraz that turned out to be our fave! All the best :)"

Some thoughtful vintage choices sprinkled around.  I felt like I was visiting with my lovely nan for the weekend.  The added bonus is some top notch wineries within walking distance."

6886387,36072680,2015-06-24,10180581,Wendy,"Alice and Tony, along with their charming children and dog, Rosie, made our short stay in Angaston a memorable one. This young and busy family make guests feel right at home. The self-contained accommodation is near the house and is well equipped and comfortable. Heating/cooling is more than adequate and the bed is very comfortable. The bathroom is clean and functional. The property is close to a number of quality restaurants and overlooks a vineyard, thus providing a degree of inspiration. Tony is a brilliant sculptor and his artworks in metal adorn the property. One of my favourites is what I call ""Ned Kelly on acid."""
6886387,36833281,2015-07-01,28773487,Hareth,Excellent place to stay in the heart of the Barossa region and really close by to Angaston. Alice was great and extremely flexible with us. Would highly recommend this place and would certainly come back. Thanks.
6886387,38029628,2015-07-12,36740136,Elizabeth,Beautiful and quiet spot.  We were made to feel very welcome!!!
6886387,38761280,2015-07-18,11329066,Wai-Kwan,"Alice's little unit was lovely and private; exactly what we were looking for.  It was also perfectly situated in the heart of the Barossa and so close to a wonderful dining spot, Vintners (as suggested by Tony!)  whilst we didn't get much of a chance to speak to Alice as we arrived late and were out the next morning, she and her husband were very kind and welcoming.  We were also suggested some fantastic wineries to check out and were highly appreciative.  I would recommend Alice's place to anyone hoping for a quiet, clean and pleasant stay in the Barossa!"
6886387,39215478,2015-07-21,37656794,Tamar,"A lovely, quaint place to stay in the heart of the Barossa, The Sculptors Shed was perfect for our short stay in Angaston. Tony was very friendly and provided lots of suggested wineries to explore and even made us a cup of coffee in the morning to get us started! Unfortunately we didn't have much of a chance to speak to Alice as we arrived late on a Sunday night. The Sculptors Shed is a good value option for exploring the Barossa. Next time we will have to stay more than one night!"

There is a TV and heater and the bathroom is modern.  I was only there for 1 night and moved on early but I would have no problem staying there again.
6886387,42060336,2015-08-10,35429945,Bryan,"Our hosts were very welcoming and their compact, clean and comfortable accommodation was the ideal base to explore the Barossa Valley.

6886387,43286251,2015-08-18,9623873,Suz,"We arrived very late on a Saturday evening and was greeted immediately at the front by Alice.  We felt very welcome and very comfortable in the room. The place was extremely clean and tidy, the bed super comfortable and there was plenty of space for everything.  It is in a fabulous location and we can wait to return again! Their dog is absolutely gorgeous and the family very friendly but having your own separate space gives you all the privacy you need.   "

The location couldn't have been better, close to all of the wineries and a great restaurant. The room itself was very cozy and colorfully decorated. Tony was a great host, giving us plenty of recommendations about the area and showing us his sculptures. Would definitely recommend this place!"
6886387,45870533,2015-09-06,37932103,Carly,The Sculptor's Shed provided a very comfortable stay. We only stayed one night and it was close to the farmers market for a delicious breakfast the next day.  Highly recommended and would love to stay there again.

6886387,48599644,2015-09-27,9900111,Elin,We loved our stay in the best part of the Barossa. The studio is beautifully and simply appointed. Hosts were friendly and offered helpful tips on where to go. We travel with bicycles and were delighted that our accom was just across the vineyard from the regional bike way.  Accom was clean and private from the main house. Nice to be able to cook for ourselves in the adjoining shed. 
6886387,48694462,2015-09-28,2902872,Andy & Teresa,"We had a lovely stay at Alice's place!

6886387,50031374,2015-10-08,37656222,Petra,"Our stay at the Sculptors Shed was delightful!  Àlice and Tony were great hosts - really flexible about check in and out times and straight forward communication in setting up our stay. They also recommended great places to see in the area and offered us a real coffee to start our day off (although I have to admit we slept so well on the comfy bed that it was mid morning before we got up so we bypassed the coffee so we could quickly get going for the day!) The accomodation was lovely - nice relaxing decor and new ensuite facilities. Being just out of Angaston means that everything in the Barossa is only a  quick car trip away. We enjoyed great food and wine, Maggie Beers Farmshop, The cheeseshop, Seppeltsville, the Jam Factory, Gully Gardens orchards, the Sculpture Park etc etc. On top of all that Tony is a talented sculptor and it is well worth checking out his work at Hentley Farm Winery. We would definitely stay again!"
6886387,50189143,2015-10-10,26923186,Anastasia,"Arrival to the property was easily identifiable by the Robotic sculptor out the front! Especially since it was almost dark, it made it easier.
We were also welcomed by the owner's dog that signalled our arrival and Tony came out to greet us and show us to our room.

Location was great and room was exactly what we needed - clean, air-conditioned with all the requirements of an ensuite to freshen up and get on with our day of exploring!"
6886387,50288865,2015-10-11,3111538,Christina,"Alice and her husband were extremely welcoming and the 'check-in' went super smooth. The Sculptures Shed was a charming little apartment we had all for ourselves, with a private bathroom (modern and clean) and a comfy bed. The best about our stay in the heart of the Barossa were the vineyards around Alice's place. We took many great shots and really enjoyed every second of our weekend getaway. We will be back for sure. "
6886387,50494404,2015-10-12,23798383,Will,The Sculptures Shed was a fantastically presented little studio. More than adequate for a couple's getaway. We would definitely come back if we are in the Barossa. Alice and Tony we very pleasant and giving hosts.
6886387,51328562,2015-10-19,26114632,Shelby,"The sculpture shed was a nice stay after a full day of wine tasting! Alice and Tony were flexible for checking in, which allowed us to explore the Barossa on our own schedule. Upon arrival they were friendly and showed us to our room. The room was super cute and was prefect for a one night stay. If you like to meet people during your travels this place will work for you. Tony and Alice did invite us to join in around their evening fire, but we we were too tired from the day. They also provided good food recommendations and a awesome lookout to see the entire valley.  "
6886387,51720613,2015-10-24,19943582,Maria,"The accommodation was clean and comfortable and well appointed.  It was peaceful and central to all we wanted to do and see in the Barossa Valley.

6886387,52556635,2015-10-30,24458724,Jon,"It's our fault we only had a day in the Barossa.  Alice was super quick to respond to request, and they made it easy on us all the way.  Alice and Tony were there to meet us and set us up.  It's fun and homey staying with them, while having all the privacy you want.  Tony was helpful with recommendations, spot on for us.  Recommend them completely."

6886387,53226743,2015-11-06,11543481,Elize,"We stayed at Alice and Tony's place for one night and we were a bit unlucky with the weather, so we haven't been able to enoy the area as much as I am sure we would have if the weather was good.

The accommodation is nicely decorated, clean an private if you want to. The location is amazing, in the middle of the Barossa valley, so don't mind staying more than one night!!

The only thing that didn't work in the room was the WIFI, probably not a problem if you are just on your holidays, but not ideal if you have to do some work. I am sure you are welcome to use the internet while sitting closer to the house, but with the weather like it was when we were there, that wasn't an option. "
6886387,53593556,2015-11-10,34340087,Sean,"Alice and Tony were great hosts, very welcoming. We will certainly be recommending their cozy and clean set up to our friend for weekends away. Tony your sculptures are fabulous and they look great around your property.  Thanks for creating such a relaxing and reguvinating environment."
6886387,54093665,2015-11-16,41085947,Sam,"We had a great few days at The Sculptors Shed, chosen for it's location - close to a fabulous restaurant, local market and cellar door within easy walking distance. Angaston is about 5 mins by car or approx 30 mins brisk walk for more cellar door opportunities, great breakfast cafe and other local amenities.  

Loved staying here - Tony and Alice were generous hosts, really warm, enthusiastic and welcoming.   We enjoyed a great bottle of wine and good craic with Tony on our first night. If you are into self-catering they have a funky kitchenette. "

The location is fantastic, just a short walk to good restaurants (eg. Vintners) and wineries or a quick taxi into Angaston.

On an extremely hot weekend our shed was cool and clean- bed very comfortable and the bathroom lovely and new. We had the use of a kitchenette in the garage and discussed with Tony our only need- coffee making facilities which he assured us was on the way . In the mean time he took time to make us a beautiful cup in his own kitchen-Lovely.
The Shed is wonderfully central to all of the Barossa and especially to Angaston  which is cute and has great cafe's.

We felt like we were on a honeymoon. We look forward to staying there again when Tony has made all the changes, especially the pizza oven ;)"
6886387,59750913,2016-01-15,6901817,Stephanie,"Great stay. Looks much better in person then in the pictures. Very clean. Also very close to Vinters which has excellent food and wine. Had a great day in the Barossa Valley and this location is the ideal spot to be when exploring. Also very cool to see Tony's sculpture, very inspiring. Wish them all the best."
6886387,60195342,2016-01-20,23478027,Pat,The shed is a cutely decorated and comfortable place to stay in the Barossa. Alice and Tony are friendly hosts. Tony is also very thoughtful to make sure we had what we needed. We felt welcomed and relaxed during our stay. We particularly enjoyed sampling the local produce hauled from the Barossa Farmers Market across the road.
6886387,60369661,2016-01-22,28486491,Sarah,"What a charming place to stay. Alice, Tony and their dog are delightful   and couldn't have been more welcoming.
LOVED the sculptures in the garden and being in the country.
Thank you both ;-))"
6886387,60569512,2016-01-25,135302,Olivier,Alice and Tony are two great host. They know the area very well and were really helpful. We had a nice time at their place. The shed is very comfortable.
6886387,60753767,2016-01-27,343063,Carolyn,"Alice & Tony's place is perfect for a stay in the Barossa. It's central to everything, the room is clean, comfortable, has everything you need and the kitchen is handy for cheese and wine hauls after a day out and about. It was easy to check in and out and Alice and Tony are friendly and easy going (and Rosie the dog is gorgeous!). Thanks guys :)"
6886387,61157553,2016-02-01,382105,Arif,"The place is s described. Beautiful, clean and functional. Tony and Alice were friendly, hospitable and helpful. The location was close to all the different wineries. "

6886387,61527186,2016-02-05,47025291,Rose,A lovely night at this place. Made welcome and had a good nights sleep   Thank you 
6886387,61776298,2016-02-08,11057869,Joanne,"What a lovely little home. Shed on the outside but like a hotel on the inside. It was so clean and such a convenient location we were able to go for a couple of nice walks on our 1 night stay. All the wineries we wanted to go to were an easy drive away. Got to meet Tony and Alice in the morning who were both very warm and friendly people. If I went to this area again I would definitely stay here again and I will also be recommending it to friends and family.
Tip: Close the window at night as the bugs get attracted to the lights inside and can sneak in. As soon as we realised we shut it and has no issues."
6886387,61984728,2016-02-10,46049788,Lyndon,"Alice and Tony made us feel very welcome at the Sculptors shed. They have turned this ""Shed"" into a wonderful comfortable space. when I first saw this listing I thought it was so querky that I just had to stay there, I was not disappointed. There is no better position in the Barossa valley than here, you are right in the middle of the four main towns that border the Barossa. This is a beautifully appointed room, we found it very well decorated and insulated from noise, weather and certainly no drafts, which you may expect in a shed. This is no ordinary shed, it is simply a wonderful room an beautiful area of Australia that must be experienced."
6886387,62134071,2016-02-11,47031521,Bianca,Super schoenes Zimmer um sich wohlzufuehlen. Das Zimmer war ein Anbau an die Garage und man ist separat zum Haus der Familie. Man kann in der Garage eine kleine Kochecke benutzen. Fuer ein Gespraech war die Familie sehr offen und total unkompliziert. Es hat an nichts gefehlt. Die Gastgeber waren sehr herzlich und nett. Wir wurden sogar noch mit frischen Nektarinen vom Garten verwoehnt. Wir wuerden dass Airbnb defintiv weiter empfehlen. Es liegt perfekt zentral zu diversen Weingueter.
6886387,62509971,2016-02-15,42011976,Meegan,What a cute and cosy place! The room was clean and bright and the location was amazing. Alice and Tony were lovely hosts and we loved patting their dog Rosie. Great place to base yourself in the Barossa.
6886387,63166613,2016-02-21,27987299,Joe And Natalie,Amazing. Would stay again! 
6886387,63352016,2016-02-22,44651362,Kelly,"We had a wedding in the Barossa and this was the perfect place to stay. Close to everything, quiet and separate from the main house! Wonderful hosts and just like the pictures, would stay again. Thanks Alice and Tony "

6886387,65494003,2016-03-15,1531079,Nancy,"We had a wonderful time in the ""shed"" -- hard to call it that because it had all creature comforts. Alice supplied anything we were lacking on a moment's notice --even brought us unlimited freshly picked apples. It was wonderful being around a young, active family, in a sculpture garden, and a perfect location. We were walking distance to the fabulous Barossa Valley Saturday market as well as the best restaurant in the valley. Easy to get to anywhere from their place. "
6886387,66024770,2016-03-19,24527590,Valerie,Excellent space - everything that I needed and all things just a short drive away. A wonderful place to stay for several days! I would definitely love to return!
6886387,66695941,2016-03-24,15067081,Paul & Colleen,"We enjoyed our stay in the Sculptor's Shed and our hosts were both friendly and considerate of our privacy. They were very accommodating on all accounts and gave some great recommendations on food and restaurants. However, the bed might be a bit hard for some. WiFi only worked reliably when in their family space which can be a bit disconcerting when you are aware of the hosts family personal space. Unfortunately we stayed at the tail-end of the vintage so there were lots of noisy trucks during the night."
6886387,67399277,2016-03-29,53515570,Carly,Had a wonderful time in the Barossa. Alice and Tony made us feel very welcome during our stay over the Easter long weekend. They even left us chocolate Easter eggs. Sculptors Shed was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend. 
6886387,67855721,2016-04-01,23264777,Melissa,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay at the shed. Both Alice and Tony were very helpful both prior and during our stay. The room and bathroom was very clean and we had easy access to basic kitchen facilities and a fridge in the garage next door. We would definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a easy, cosy place to stay while visiting the Barossa. "
6886387,68173932,2016-04-02,35659102,Joanne,"Such a great location to base yourself in the Barossa. Tony was really helpful when we arrived. Showed us the ""shed"" and kitchenette and gave us tips on where to eat and wineries to see. The Sculptors Shed looks nothing like a shed inside. It's well insulated and comfortable for two, although I will agree with another persons review that the bed was a little hard for my liking. We didn't use the wi-fi access which was in the house but we were welcome to. Tony was very welcoming.  Even though I prefer a softer mattress I would still recommend anyone to stay here and would stay here again myself.  
Tips for places to dine and wineries, Tscharke (great, tasty and CHEAP wines), Yalumba (impressive cellar door with nice wines) (both are Vegan BTW), Artisans for tastings and lunch ( Lucy was great for tastings) St Hallets, Rockford. Go to Vintners for dinner or lunch ( don't eat anything else for the day), Blonde cafe in Angaston town, fermenAsian in Tanunda."
6886387,68293044,2016-04-04,12821558,Catherine,"The Sculptor's Shed is in a great location in the Barossa, especially to visit wineries and the Farmer's Market down the road! It's got everything you need in a private little space, and Alice and Tony were very friendly. Highly recommended!"
6886387,68741952,2016-04-06,14772028,Maryanne,"Alice and Tony made us feel very welcome, meeting us on arrival, showing us around their lovely property and chatting about things to do in the area. The Sculptor's Shed is fabulous accommodation, quirky on the outside and modern and luxurious on the inside. It was also great to have access to kitchenette facilities nearby so we could organise our own breakfast. 
I would have no hesitation in recommending this accommodation and the hosts to others."
6886387,69176536,2016-04-09,11558748,Antonia,"A great stay in the very cute shed. Interior was lovely! Tony and Alice were friendly and we enjoyed sitting out on their terrace with a bottle of wine and seeing one of Tony's fire pits being lit. Excellent location for Barossa, right near the farmers market and vintners! "

6886387,71007467,2016-04-22,46758180,Nele,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The room is small and very cosy. The bathroom was nice. It's a nice quiet spot if you want to explore Barossa. You can hear some traffic noise once in a while, but nothing to bother about. We were greeted very friendly. Were allowed to use the fridge and kitchen next door, which was really good. A nice place. Really liked it there!"
6886387,71401570,2016-04-25,51359595,Brigid,The Sculptors Shed was in a fantastic location for a weekend away. Their veranda was perfect for enjoying a cheese plate and a bottle of wine too. We didn't see Alice and Tony the whole weekend but had everything we needed.

We loved sitting with a glass of wine admiring the sculpture yard and hearing about the area's history. The property is surrounded by vineyards and is very charming. Our room had everything we needed for our short stay. Thank you Tony and family.

The room was warm and cosy, perfectly clean, well functioned heater in a cold winter night. We were able to use the kitchen next door with everything we need, TV was the company of our dinner.  On our road trip to one of the winery which we went on the wrong road, that was not suppose to be drove in under rain, and we got stuck in the muddy road. We called Alice immediately for help and Tony was then came over to rescue us in the rainy and freezing muddy road. He tried to use all his skill and equipment to toll our car out and finally got us home safe. he was so thoughtful that tried to minimise the damage of our car!!! He even offered to help fixing the little broken part of the car (perfectly) for us in his workshop. We won't be able to survive without his generous help. They are the superhero to us and we highly recommend Tony to anyone who got stuck in the muddy road!!!!! THANK YOU TONY AND ALICE!  THEY ARE THE BEST AIRBNB HOST THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD!"

The shed is small as expected but exactly what we wanted - a comfortable bed and hot shower so we could spend our time discovering the many wineries and restaurants in the area. The location wasn't in the main township as I thought it might be, but it turned out to be perfect as it was minutes to everything! Close by is Vintners for a beautiful meal, and we loved heading to the farmer's market (very close) for breakfast and shopping. The shed is close to the main house, but we felt as though we had enough privacy. Excellently comfortable, clean, and a great price! Thank you for making our trip extra special. "

Alice and Tony are really friendly and laid back, and happy to share their local knowledge with you. They have 3 kids and a kelpie/Staff cross, Rosie, who is as welcoming as Alice and Tony themselves. Do try Vintners Restaurant (walkable), and the Saturday Farmers' Market, situated behind Vintners.

6886387,128566829,2017-01-25,103637995,Laura,"Great little spot, close drive to all the wineries. Vitner's bar and grill is about a 10min walk and offers up some yummy food (they were also accommodating for vegetarians). The place has everything you need for a night or more in the Barossa. Alice and Tony were away for the night but we're really friendly and helpful. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
6886387,128998382,2017-01-28,44725595,Tracey,"Alice and Tony were lovely hosts, the accommodation is exactly as described and good value for money. The room is cosy with an ensuite bathroom and is a great base for exploring the Barossa.  Firm bed, fluffy pillows, hot shower with good water pressure. Basic kitchen amenities in the shed next door. We had no problems with the wifi but some people do (reading reviews). Alice and Tony were great communicators and very helpful with things to see and do while visiting the Barossa if help is required. I had researched what we wanted to do and they confirmed I was on the right track. Our main reason for choosing to stay here was being able to walk to Vintner's Bar & Grill. Absolutely fantastic restaurant just 10min walk down the road. We would happily stay here again."

The shed is basic and small, but modern, comfortable, very clean, and just what I needed at the end of a day touring the area. It was sweltering hot when I visited (thank goodness for airconditioning)  and Alice was kind enough to drop me at Vintners bar and grill so I could enjoy a couple of wines with dinner. Would definitely recommend as a good value option. Alice and Tony were lovely hosts. "
6886387,131637828,2017-02-12,15363777,Martin,Alice and Tony were lovely and very hospitable and their accomodation was perfect for our weekend of exploring the Barossa region. Exactly what we were after. Thank you
6886387,132107252,2017-02-15,38831812,Emma,"We stayed at Tony and Alice's place for two nights - and was exactly as described. They were both lovely and greeted us on arrival and gave us some tips about which wineries to visit and places to eat. I would stay here again. Having access to a fridge and somewhere to make a sandwich (simple food prep) etc was great.
If you are looking for somewhere relaxed and easy going this is the place. "

6886387,142358854,2017-04-07,16805576,Vanessa,"Alice and Tony were great hosts, super friendly and full of recommendations on what to do in the region. They have a lovely home only a few minutes walk from a very nice local restaurant, perfect for a nice dinner after a full day of wine tasting!

The shed is cosy and clean and it's great to be able to use the kitchenette and fridge next door. Rosie, their dog is cute and loves cuddles. Great location to explore the wineries from either by car or by bike - the bike path to Tanunda is not far and the farmers market is close by."

6886387,148936583,2017-05-01,2376448,Robyn,Excellent place to stay for a couple of days of exploring the Barossa. Tony and Alice were very welcoming and it was a lovely warm room for our autumn stay. We got to walk through a vineyard to get to the bike track between angaston and nuriootpa
6886387,150411845,2017-05-07,11242402,Ashleigh,"Really cute little place right next to the vineyards. Had an almost camping feel as you exit the room to go into the shed next door for tea or kitchen items which is actually quite nice as you get some fresh air. The hosts are really lovely and they have a sweet little dog too  Only downside is that it's not very private as it's right behind the back of their house so you don't really have much space outside if you want to hang out on your own but they tell you this in the description so just beware. The room itself has all the basics you need with a comfy bed, heating for the cold nights a little bathroom. All you need for a good rest before exploring the Barossa "
6886387,151259232,2017-05-12,119326364,Glenn,"Great character setup, Alice and Tony were very helpful, and great value in the heart of the Barossa."

6886387,153336838,2017-05-20,51097541,Jeremy,"We had such a memorable stay at 'the sculptors shed'. The accommodation was modern and cosy, Alice and Tony were extremely hospitable and made us feel very welcome. Their children are also delightful.

Thanks for making our stay in the Barossa so fabulous and we really enjoyed getting to know you both over a few glasses of wine!"
6886387,154495069,2017-05-24,45640051,Karen,"A nice, clean and comfortable place to stay in the Barossa Valley. Close to restaurants, especially if you are also looking to have dinner in the Barossa. Tony provided great recommendations for places to visit and dine. "
6886387,155301013,2017-05-28,52574988,Siobhan,Alice and Tony's home is superb. The room is completely self sufficient and brilliant if you are looking for some peace and quiet.

6886387,163474769,2017-06-25,9823789,Paul,Quiet cute little place well located between Angaston and Tanunda. 5 min walk to Vintiners Bar and Grill and Farmers market on Saturdays.....
6886387,166240991,2017-07-03,28194705,Lachlan,"Thanks Alice and Tony for hosting us, the heating and electric blankets were great for a cold Barossa winter, made the room nice and cozy. Tony's tips on the Barossa were great, especially highlighting some smaller vineyards that we had not considered. There is also a great array of brochures for local attractions which helped us out.
Check in and check out were a breeze, thanks again for a memorable stay!  "
6886387,166602845,2017-07-04,125122367,Leila,Amazing hospitality and such a beautiful place to stay! Highly highly recommend and we will be returning many times!!
6886387,168645400,2017-07-10,78235629,Erin,"The sculptors shed provided us with a simple but cosy base from which to explore the Barossa. We had our own car which made all Barossa wineries and restaurants very easily accessible, it is a great central location. Alice and Tony were very welcoming and friendly, despite the shed being in close proximity to the house we didn't feel like we were intruding nor did we feel it was lacking any privacy. Thank you!"
6886387,169528254,2017-07-13,31765445,Darren,"Alice and Tony are great hosts and can be as public or private as you want. The place is clean, warm and central to so much that the Barossa has to offer. We loved it."

6886387,178140880,2017-08-05,137592792,Anthony,"The Sculptor's Shed is a cosy, clean, up to date and relaxing place and is a credit to it's owners. It is central to all of the Barossa's winery's and restaurants, but secluded enough to relax and unwind. I will have no hesitation in returning in the future."
6886387,181520844,2017-08-13,1960587,Nelson,Alice and Tony have a lovely little set up in their backyard and the room was quaint and comfortable. There was lots of information on the region provided as well. Would recommend!

6886387,190302428,2017-09-04,143216543,Debbie,"Maybe good for one or two nights but no more, as very small with limited storage space for baggage.  Wi-Fi not working in your room is inconvenient and no where for a couple to sit in room to eat or drink, so your bed is used for everything from eating, sitting, sleeping and watching tv."
6886387,192684704,2017-09-10,3184157,Tesh,Great experience staying pretty much in the middle of vineyards. Alice and Tony are great hosts. We were traveling with our two year old son who had such a great time with the family dog and hens!
6886387,194084245,2017-09-15,16693482,Jo,We stayed at Alice and Tony's place for 3 nights. It was a great base to explore the Barossa from. Alice and Tony were great hosts. The Sculptors Shed  was small but worked well. Had the weather been warmer we could have taken advantage of their large outdoor lounge area. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend The Sculptors Shed
6886387,195313582,2017-09-18,130356115,Sean,Great property. Views of the vineyard with great outdoor area.
6886387,196058903,2017-09-22,55062854,Julia,"We loved staying in Alice and Tony's shed, which was clean and comfortable and well-situated for exploring the Barossa on foot or by car. (It's a 25-minute walk into Nuriootpa.) Alice and Tony were both very friendly and made us feel at home, giving us lots of information about local attractions and restaurants. They were also great at communicating beforehand and being flexible with check-in times. Would definitely stay again!"
6886387,197249757,2017-09-25,147025972,Shiraz,"Great little room at the back of Tony & Alice's place. Quiet location and yet still close to town. A gorgeous little studio and the premises are surrounded by amazing sculpture work. 
Alice and Tony were very welcoming. Thanks again for making our stay easy and recommending the best coffee in Tanunda at Artisans!"
6886387,197796227,2017-09-27,74754564,Natalie,Great place to stay with really friendly and helpful hosts.
6886387,198266719,2017-09-29,40167613,Andrew,"Alice and Tony's space is very comfortable and as described.  The hosts are very welcoming and friendly and their place would be great as somewhere to be based while exploring the Barossa.  A car would be needed though.
I only had one night on this trip but would definitely look to stay again on my next and longer stay."
6886387,199421812,2017-10-01,55216582,Anne,"Communication was always prompt and helpful. Easy to find. Room is clean and comfortable though small. Has everything needed for an overnight stay. 
No tea / coffee provided and kitchen is not set up for cooking. Fridge access appreciated."
6886387,200547744,2017-10-06,2726093,Rayann,"Imagine vast skies, rows of vines, distant hills, fresh air, rustic art and a friendly dog at your feet. This is what I'll remember about Tony and Alice's place.

The room itself is compact and cozy, with a picture window and a fab vintage door. The bed is comfy and the bathroom clean. All you could need after days out exploring. There is a small kitchen in the big shed next door. Perfect for storing the gourmet bites and wine you will definitely pick up while in the Barossa.  We made tea/coffee and a basic breakfast each morning. It is a shed with a kitchen so you probably wouldn't want to cook a big meal. But with so much to eat nearby I can't imagine why you'd want to.

Possibly our favourite part was the veranda with big old table. You can sit out enjoy the view and plan your next outing. The yard is also filled with Tony's amazing metal work art, which is well worth a look.

Location wise, the shed is between two towns.  One of the bike paths connects them and you can join it easily just around the corner. We rented bikes one day (ask Alice and Tony for a recommendation he was great and offered delivery and pick up). Do note one direction was nice and flat the other is quite uphill. There is also an amazing restaurant just down the road (walkable).

Finally Alice and Tony are amazing hosts. There when you need them and happy to chat and offer great local insight. But also respectful of your privacy and space. We would return in a heartbeat."
6886387,201217334,2017-10-08,152390683,Alison,"Good location, close to restaurants and wineries. Small room but this was no issue for us as we were out sight seeing most of the time. Hosts were friendly but did not intrude on our privacy. A dog is on site but is ultra friendly and remarkabley quiet. There is access to a small kitchenette in the shed next door but be aware there is no breakfast provisions provided. Overall a good experience would recommend for a couple for a short stay."
6886387,202106381,2017-10-10,39044276,Patrice,"Alice and Tony's place is totally lovely.  It's in a fantastic location to explore the delights of the Barossa.  The shed itself is clean and comfortable, overlooking vineyards, we wish we could have stayed for longer!"

6886387,203893499,2017-10-16,32895381,Juliette,"We loved staying at The Sculptors Shed! Alice and Tony were great hosts - their house is situated perfectly to sample everything that Barossa has to offer. The room was clean, tiny and comfortable and so so quiet, it's very separate from the rest of the house so you have your own space. Highly recommend!"

6886387,205331609,2017-10-22,7058315,Hannah & Scott,"Great little place, very relaxing staying right next to some beautiful vines.

Alice and Tony were great hosts!"
6886387,207790386,2017-10-30,3084087,Megan,"Alice and Tony's place provides a great base to explore the Barossa. The local farmers market is only a short walk from the house! The Shed is very clean, comfortable and secure. Alice and Tony were lovely hosts - very friendly and responsive, check-in and -out were a breeze. Highly recommended."
6886387,208537829,2017-11-02,7737885,Amy,Alice and Tony's place was a brilliant stop off point! The shed / studio is simple but has everything you need. Comfy bed and spotlessly clean. Set on their family property with a super friendly dog & chickens next to Tony's sculpture shed. Great location close to all the vineyards. I had a beautiful dinner on their recommendation at Vinters literally 200m up the road. Best lamb I've ever eaten! Tony & Alice are extremely friendly & down to earth. Highly recommend. 
6886387,209278725,2017-11-05,148758730,Caroline,"Alice and Tony's place is unique. You can see how they love the place and they made it for us to love as well.
They gave great advice on what to do around there and where to eat. The place is not to far from 3 city centers where you can find shops and restaurants and there are a lot of cellar doors around there."
6886387,210013330,2017-11-07,3624720,Simon,"We had a great one night stay on our way through the Barossa. Perfect location, lovely room, friendly hosts and a very cute dog! Would definitely recommend Tony and Alice's place for any single or couple on an indulgent wine trip."

Alice and Tony’s place is just as described so you know what to expect and we felt very welcome. We particularly enjoyed the spacious shower and electric blanket on the (Website hidden by Airbnb) was a very chilly night!

We didn’t spend much time there, as we were out ::all: weekend but it was very nice and private to come back to at the end of the day. 
The kitchen amenities are in a shed attached to the room and were very rustic but fine for us to grab a quick breakfast in the morning, which we brought with us. There was everything we needed as far as kitchen utensils and also some tea bags (essential requirement after a journey!).  
The outdoor space is wonderful as well for enjoying a cup of tea or a glass of wine. Alice and Tony were extremely accommodating and although we did not need their help, were very great for local knowledge. 
Although the space is located in their backyard and they have kids and pets, we didn’t see them all weekend! 
Highly recommend for a stay in the Barossa if you have a busy weekend of wine tasting planned ❤️"

7055506,40957667,2015-08-03,3242998,Gloria,"We had a wonderful stay, Karen made us feel so welcome and at home and gave us lots of helpful suggestions on where to go during our trip.  Absolutely fantastic location, just a short drive from all of the wineries and town centre.  We especially loved the indoor fireplace, fluffy bathrobes and that the pantry was so well stocked with farm fresh produce - we didn't have to go out to get anything. Karen was easy going and really helpful - always just a quick text or call away.  The house was spotless and made a great retreat. We would definitely come back!"
7055506,42422921,2015-08-13,5777212,Ian,"Is there a better place to stay in the Barossa Valley ?? Nestled in a beautiful little vineyard, you are just a few minutes from Tanunda and Nuriootpa and all that they have to offer. The cottage has all you could possibly need and Karen stocks the larder with sensational local produce. Would not hesitate to recommend the Vineyard Cottage to friends and family. "
7055506,45419479,2015-09-02,4425011,Amanda,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at under the vines. Karen was very welcoming and there is lots of local area info available at the property. The local produce provided for brekky was fantastic, and loved chilling out with a wine by the fire in the evenings. Location is close to lots of wineries and eateries. Would definitely recommend this awesome spot! "
7055506,46423269,2015-09-10,41965695,Daniel,Was a wonderful experience staying at Under the vines. When we arrived there was a little chocolate on the bed for each guest and there was even a treat for our 18 month old toddler. The description and location were accurate and we really enjoyed staying here. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.
7055506,48710441,2015-09-28,9441817,Justin,Karren was lovely she was very welcoming and the place was much as described and more. She helped me out great sorted out wine and a platter for me for a special occassion it was close to wineries as we rode our bikes around for the day. I would very much recomend karen and her cottage we will certianly be back. Lovely spot. 
7055506,52740541,2015-11-01,10899597,Yvonne,"Great house on small vineyard, with an incredibly well equipped kitchen, with local milk and cream in the fridge! Great location, only a max 15 minute drive to all the main attractions of Barossa."
7055506,56120731,2015-12-09,25514930,Michelle,"Karen made us feel very welcome, by greeting us at the property and showing us where everything was. She gave us some excellent local tips - where to eat, which wineries to visit, etc.

The property was great. Very private and truly under the vines - gorgoeus, handy location. It was clean and well appointed with comfortable king sized beds, excellent breakfasts and AC (much needed on our 40+ degree mini break!). "
7055506,59507895,2016-01-11,29343482,Dan,"I really enjoyed my stay at Under the Vines. A very cool venue, complete with jacuzzi bath and surrounded by the vines. Karen made the process very smooth and we'd be happy to recommend it to friends."
7055506,60272629,2016-01-21,15948897,David,"What a fantastic spot! Thanks to Karen for meeting us on a tricky timeframe as we raced across NSW, Victoria and SA, but the trip was well worth it. Well-appointed for our group of five, with beautiful local produce for breakfast waiting for us. Sitting on the back porch looking over the vines to the Barossa Ranges was amazing and everywhere we wanted to visit was within easy reach. Bathroom and exterior toilets are fine - just watch out for the spiders."
7055506,60679314,2016-01-26,47291939,Kelly,"The perfect location for a weekend in the Barossa - quiet, set amongst vineyards, and close to Tanunda. The breakfast supplies were phenomenal and there's all the basics you need if you're going to cook a meal for dinner. Karen and Russell were great hosts, and very receptive to our individual requests. We totally recommend Under the Vines!"
7055506,62154294,2016-02-12,23573308,Paul,"Two big thumbs up!  The description and photos are entirely accurate.  This is a delightful, spacious, fully equipped and comfortable home.  That it's smack dab in the middle of a vineyard is a bonus.  It's about halfway between the villages of Tanunda and  Nurioopa, so a car is needed for shopping and restaurants. The location is otherwise perfect as a base for wine tasting in the Barossa.  "
7055506,63032285,2016-02-19,56888746,Peter,"Under The Vines was a perfect little spot for a relaxing stay. Everything was provided and the food provided was of exceptional quality and taste.

This is definitely a hidden gem among quality Barossa accommodation. 

I most certainly recommend staying here."
7055506,65012671,2016-03-10,54111226,Claire,"We stayed at Karen's vineyard cottage at the beginning of March and had the most wonderful time.  The accommodation was exactly as described and the kitchen was so well stocked with equipment it was like being in my own kitchen at home.
The locally sourced breakfast items that were provided were amazing as were all the little extras like leaving a little box of smarties for our toddler.
It was great to have all the entertainment equipment as we loved being able to plug our iPod in and also watch some movies.  
The beds were very comfortable and huge and we slept very well there.
It was vintage during our stay and Russell was so good at ensuring that we were not disturbed; often we didn't even know he was around.  However, after he discovered we were genuinely interested in what was happening, he spent quite a bit of his time explaining everything and was so friendly - it was a highlight of the trip!
Karen was a fantastic host who from the beginning answered all our queries very quickly and was there to greet us when we arrived.  The actual location was super convenient, close to lots of wineries and very peaceful but with only a short drive into the centre of town. We are very much hoping to come back and spend some more time here."
7055506,65561689,2016-03-15,57475174,Chiara,"My stay at Under the Vines was just perfect! I was part of a group of 5 girls that stayed at Karen's cottage and we all loved our time here. Everything was set up beautifully for us, even 'female' themed with pink balloons, chocolates and pink champagne. The cottage has a great living area, separate spacious kitchen and 2 large bedrooms. Beautiful big bathroom too. The back of the cottage overlooks the private vineyard which added to the feel of being in the Barossa wine region. The cottage was in a great spot in the Barossa region, on 5 minute drive to the Tanunda town centre. 
Karen is a wonderful and welcoming host. I wish I could have stayed longer in her beautiful cottage!! "
7055506,66146845,2016-03-20,24417306,Lance,"Under the Vines was an absolutely delightful place to stay. The location was ideal for exploring the Barossa, dining out and relaxing in an ideallic setting. Karen and Russell were marvellous hosts, who ensured we wanted for nothing. We highly recommend staying here and we will be back."
7055506,70566426,2016-04-18,64729289,Hayley,"We loved our time at Under the Vines. When we arrived the kitchen was stocked with milk, eggs, tomato, mushrooms, cereal and some of the best bacon we've had in a long time. Not to mention locally roasted coffee! The house is clean and spacious with a huge shower and spa bath. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, glassware etc. Even had sharp knives! Setting is beautiful being surrounded by a working vineyard (didn't see anyone the whole time so still felt private). It's about 5-10 min drive from Tanunda town centre, which suited us. Seemed to be plenty of taxis around so popping to town for a few drinks with a meal wasn't a problem."
7055506,71502546,2016-04-25,24087877,Tim,"Beautiful property and very welcoming host. We really enjoyed the time, particularly drinking wine on the grass in the middle of a vineyard. The house was warm, tidy, modern and the fireplace was a nice addition for the cool evenings. "
7055506,71983077,2016-04-30,33018208,David,A perfect position and setting in the vines. The house had everything we required and was very well provisioned. Right in the centre of the Barossa. We would definitely come back again.
7055506,80029237,2016-06-15,2320589,Bec,"Karen's cottage was the perfect spot from which to explore the Barossa.  She was very thoughtful about every detail and it made the difference to our stay. The beds are cosy and warm, and the fireplace keeps the whole cottage nice and snug. We had a wonderful time there."
7055506,82675832,2016-06-28,50364030,Tegan,We had a wonderful stay at under the vines. We had absolutely everything we needed and the accommodation was just perfect. We have spent our days since returning lamenting the lack of a fire place and spar bath in our lives. I would highly recommend this property as an ideal location and luxury accommodation in the Barossa! 
7055506,83783390,2016-07-04,15355595,Anita,"Karen's place was absolutely perfect! She made us feel totally at home. 

There was a goodie basket of local produce for breakfast. We had a choice of toast with local jams, muesli, cereal and of course the important bacon and eggs. She'd even left us some orange juice!

The location is great. We thought at first it might be a bit far out of town but it's a very short drive and actually conveniently located between both Tanunda and Angaston. It's set in its own private vineyard. 

The photos don't even do it justice. It was very comfortable with great beds and the best bath!

I would thoroughly recommend Karen's place. Will definitely stay again. "
7055506,88569728,2016-07-24,5673982,Daniel,"We had a wonderful stay at Under the Vines. Karen is an accommodating host, who had a clean house warm and ready with a fridge stocked with delicious food for breakfast. Highly recommend staying here."
7055506,90264935,2016-07-31,78240761,Michael,"A truly wonderful experience. It had all the comforts of home and then some. The breakfast basket was full of local produce ... enough for two days for my wife and I. The woodfire was prepared for us and well stocked for a cosy weekend. The house itself was spotless, well equiped and included a large range of fun things to do. In a great location for getting around the Barossa. All in all, a perfect spot for a romantic weekend."
7055506,104256856,2016-09-25,6480440,Greg,Karen met us just after we arrived and made us feel very welcome. The house had all the amenities and was very clean.
7055506,104660186,2016-09-27,65984814,Sam,"We had an amazing stay at Karen's property in the Barossa. 

The house is situated perfectly, only a short drive away from many restaurants and vineyards. Karen was a great host, met us upon arrival and showed us around the property. 

It has everything you would need for a great stay including fresh food for breakfast, a selection of coffee and milk and every utensil needed. 

Overall it was an amazing stay and would love to stay here again next time we visit SA!"
7055506,107547134,2016-10-10,87459040,Brian,"It is set in vineyards with an amazing country feel to the place. The host displayed generous hospitality in supplying an outstanding locally produced gourmet breakfast. The cottage contained up to date comforts to a very high standard including wireless Internet. A great destination for our wedding anniversary. Well located between Nuriootpa, Tanunda and Angaston. A short drive to all the tourist spots including wineries. "
7055506,109304467,2016-10-20,22508329,Samantha,"Excellent location and beautiful property. Large bedrooms with black out blinds which made having a lay in far too easy! Well stocked Kitchen meant that we were able to cook easily.
We also loved sitting in the garden in amongst the vines watching the sun go down - beautiful! Would definitely return again in future."
7055506,111569254,2016-10-31,27400365,Melanee,Everything we could've wanted (plus more) was there. Very clean and well appointed throughout ... 6ft husband easily relaxed in the spa. Generous thoughtful hosts. Perfect 2 day honeymoon venue.
7055506,114935775,2016-11-20,26812011,Gemma,"Under the Vines is a quaint but luxurious retreat. It feels very private but is just a few minutes' drive from towns, between Nuriootpa and Tanunda. We stayed here on the first really warm weekend of summer and it was a lovely and cool oasis to return to after visiting wineries and other sights. Drawing the thick curtains allows for easy sleep-ins the next morning. The kitchen is very well stocked with excellent local produce for cooked breakfast, including locally roasted beans to use in the coffee machine. Being surrounded by vineyards makes adds to the feeling of having an authentic Barossa experience. Our host Karen was great in her communication, and even offered to post back a pair of sandals and a Lego piece my children left behind! Much appreciated. "
7055506,116248867,2016-11-28,33631662,Michele,"We had a lovely 5 day stay at Karen's Under the Vines cottage. Karen was a fantastic host and very personable. From booking the cottage to greeting us when we arrive, Karen was very responsive. The cottage is lovely and secluded but was only a 5 min drive into Tanunda. I recommend visiting FermentAsian for excellent dining.  The breakfast provision provided were plentiful and very generous and 5 different types of milk to choose from! This airBnB was probably the most well stocked place I have stayed in.  Clearly much thought has gone into what traveller's might need; this place felt like you were visiting someone's house. Thank you for hosting us Karen and i hope many more visitors have the opportunity to discover this lovely area of the Barossa and your lovely hospitality. "
7055506,120438419,2016-12-10,85267799,Jillian,"Karen's cottage was in a great location almost situated halfway between the towns of Tanunda and Anguston. Very quiet location.  Good size cottage although there was only two us.  If two couples stayed, having the toilet in the bathroom, may be a little difficult. However, with just two of us, the bathroom was very adequate. Very comfortable bed.  Two huge bean bags to sit on the lawn, everything very clean and the kitchen well stocked including tasty breakfast goodies.  We had a relaxing week in the cottage."
7055506,120484548,2016-12-10,99949168,Paula,A beautiful place. Loved it!
7055506,122977942,2016-12-26,19430136,Ralph,"Fantastic, comfy and clean home located in a perfectly peaceful and private vineyard, managed by the wonderfully prompt and pleasant Karen. Thank you for helping to make our stay so very memorable. "
7055506,123344682,2016-12-28,49383160,Olga,"Karen is the most attentive and friendly host.  She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around her lovely property.  Communication was extremely easy and efficient.  The cottage is well located just outside Tanunda, with easy and inexpensive cab ride into the town centre. 

The cottage has everything one needs or wants for a comfortable and cosy stay including tasty breakfast provisions from Barossa.  Lovely vineyard views from pretty much every window.  Would definitely return.  "
7055506,127090769,2017-01-15,92190438,David,Awesome place to stay in the Barossa. Amongst the vines at its finest.
7055506,128172849,2017-01-22,69255117,Jessica,"Exceptional host and accomodation. The house is on the outskirts of Tanunda so easy access to everything in town while also feeling secluded and private. Also a quick 10 minute drive to Angaston. Location is fantastic. The house had everything we needed, a big comfy bed, aircon in each room, a big lounge, a huge luxurious bathroom and a great kitchen stocked up by the host with local produce for us. We will absolutely come back to stay here."
7055506,131293446,2017-02-11,23245796,Stephanie,Fabulous accomodation. Would recommend to anyone visiting Barossa. Karen is a great host.
7055506,132092775,2017-02-15,15118435,Warren,"The photos of Karen's Vineyard Cottage on the website don't do it justice at all.  It is very peaceful and quiet. Karen has outfitted the cottage and provided every possible comfort, food and essentials you can think of to make your stay at the cottage very pleasant.  She has exceeded our expectations........definitely 10 out of 10 and beyond :)
The accomodation is suitable for couples and families.
We highly recommend staying at Karen's Vineyard Cottage when you visit Tanunda.  It is also very centrally located but still offers quiet and peaceful surroundings.
Too many details to comment on and the only way to experience what we experienced is to stay at Karen's Vineyard Cottage.  You will not be disappointed.
One of the best BNB's we have stayed in and we have stayed in many BNBs 
 "
7055506,135727848,2017-03-05,25045712,Qing,"What a wonderful experience we had. This place was absolutely amazing! Quiet and scenic. Tucked off the road and with 5 acres of vines, this house was just beautiful.
I can't recommend Karen and the place more. There was everything we need there and it was so close to all the wineries and vineyards. Simply stunning! Can't wait to come back!"

7055506,157913964,2017-06-05,42874720,Drew,Beautiful place with a very friendly host. The wood burning fire place on a cold night was divine. Will stay here next time I'm in the Barossa valley. 
7055506,159869583,2017-06-11,23552332,Gaby,"We had a great stay at Karen's place over the long weekend. The place had everything you need and very close to some really great wineries making it easy to ride around on bicycles for the day.
The fresh produce was lovely, the coffee delicious, access to some port in the barrel also a bonus and the fire being ready in the fireplace a great touch for our wintery getaway.
We couldn't fault our stay in this place and would recommend to all that want to discover the Barossa!"
7055506,161928532,2017-06-19,19620344,Daniel,"Our stay was great, it was a lovely quiet relaxing getaway."

If only there was nothing else to do in the Barossa, we would have just been happy to enjoy the little home in the vineyard.  Karen greeted us personally and encouraged us to relax and treat ourselves which was easily done.  The country breakfast goodies provided were a delicious start to our day.  Yum.   "
7055506,168996384,2017-07-11,125782542,Rachel,"Lovely, thank-you!"
7055506,171191217,2017-07-17,10106347,Clara,"Under the vines was truly amazing. A location that's central to everything nothing was more than 10-15 mins drive away. You get a well appointed home with plenty of amenities to keep you comfy. The house is tucked away in a little vineyard and the backyard faces a pretty spectacular view. I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast spread that Karen stocked up in the pantry and the fireplace kept us warm throughout our stay. Make sure you lounge in the outdoor beanbags with a blanket, a hot cuppa and a good book. "
7055506,171842987,2017-07-19,138490745,David,"Such a great location and atmosphere. It was a cold wet time we spent in the Barossa, but the warmth and coziness of the wood fire and interior made it so welcoming and comfortable. The little details and effort really made it for me, like extensive fresh and local breakfast ingredients supplied, fireplace built and ready to go, tv and entertainment, and detailed easy to read information about everything in the area. Will definitely be recommending to friends who stay in the Barossa.
10/10!"

I highly recommend renting a car so you're able to drive around. Karen leaves several taxi and shuttle information so you can spend a day safely traveling between the wineries. We will definitely be back!"
7055506,190299860,2017-09-04,147602175,Teresa,We loved our stay here. Karen had thought of everything we could possibly have needed. My only regret is that we didn't stay for longer.

She really has thought of it all - anything you've forgotten she's probably provided a spare! Kitchen stocked, comfortable beds, amazing bath. Delicious breakfast and coffee (although my barista skills didn't do it justice). If this place is available for your dates then I highly recommend booking it while you can!!!"
7055506,219169513,2017-12-16,156689418,Olivia,"Thanks so much for being a great host, really appreciated the quick communication.

7055506,223155441,2017-12-31,23507738,Charlie,"Would have given a 6 stars if there is an option to it.

Karen's place is well situated in the Barossa valley with almost every major vineyard & attractions less than 10mins drive away. With a vineyard just right outside the house, one can enjoy their meals/drinks at the backyard while enjoying the vineyard views. 

And if u enjoy cooking, do look forward to a well stocked full kitchen & the fresh food supplied by Karen for breakfast.

I must say, to have a full Barossa Valley experience, one would have to stay at this place to complete it."
7055506,224956479,2018-01-04,160941945,Chen,"This is the best airbnb house I stayed so far! Karen has gone extra miles to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This is a lovely house in the vinyard, with thoughtful touches of welcome candies, fresh food, tour information, etc. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to travel to Barossa."

7055506,230297522,2018-01-27,17903140,Michael,Excellent comfortable and well equipped accommodation in a very peaceful location. A former commercial building has been remodelled by the owners as a stylish modern apartment that is genuinely situated amidst the vines.
7055506,230753700,2018-01-28,22826679,Thanh,Karen was really prompt with communication from the beginning. The accommodation is located in close proximity to all the wineries and other attractions in Barossa Valley which was really good as well as the fact that it's in the middle of a vineyard!!! It was such an experience to stay right in the midst of growing grapevines! We wished we could have stayed for longer. Everything was well laid out for us and Karen provided us with amazing breakfast and so many options such as juices and different types of milk!! Air conditioning in every room provided us with so much relief during 43 degree heat days and were on when we arrived. There is a spa and also a tv in the bathroom :) what an experience!!! Karen and  co. thank you so much again for your amazing hospitality. Definitely choose this place if you're heading to Barossa Valley to maximise your experience!
7055506,231180798,2018-01-31,169377445,Anthony,"Really great place to stay - it's very cosy, the breakfast, tea and coffee that were provided were great, and the bluetooth speaker had really good sound which was a bonus!"
7055506,233279364,2018-02-09,14514102,Kerry,"We loved Under the Vines - the photos really don’t do it justice.  I don’t know many places where you can sit in the back garden next to growing vines.  All the little touches made our stay extra special - the chocolates on our bed, the beautiful breakfast supplies (it really was next level) and the ability to check in and out early/late.  This place is great and Karen was delightful.  I highly recommend it."
7055506,234477682,2018-02-12,69163926,Nicholas,"Fantastic stay.  Facilities, location and easy of dealing with Karen just made the stay even better.  highly recommend"

7055506,238992943,2018-02-27,172624653,Stephanie,Karen’s home is a lovely getaway in a gorgeous setting w a vineyard. Two bedrooms make it good value for two couples or a family. Short drive to shops and restaurants. Karen left is some ingredients for a breakfast cook up too - so lovely and thoughtful!

The cottage, the grounds and location were superb, but what we loved most were the unbelievably thoughtful touches - fresh bread, local coffee, bathrobes. Just awesome. Thanks for thinking of everything, Karen!"
7055506,251429905,2018-04-08,44124489,Aimee,"Under the Vines is the perfect Barossa getaway! While we felt secluded in this location with plenty of privacy and quiet, it was only a 5 minute drive into Tanunda which was perfect. We enjoyed a lovely afternoon in the sun surrounded by the vineyard enjoying local cheeses and wines. 
Karen is a great host, super prompt with all communication and the little touches left around the place were so thoughtful! 
Our group consisted of 2 couples and this place was big enough that we never felt like we were in each other’s way. 
We would recommend Under the Vines to anyone looking for a Barossa Valley experience!"
7055506,253555655,2018-04-15,108675499,Nicole,Karen was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
7055506,254740269,2018-04-18,33000424,Ken,"A beautiful little house, perfect for two couples, great for just the two of us, handy to both Tanunda and Nurioopta. Karen has thought of everything for her guests’ comfort and enjoyment. We’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s here and overseas but none that could match all the little touches Karen has added. Five stars plus another for Karen’s communication and enthusiasm."

7055506,262152127,2018-05-08,25045712,Qing,"This was our second time staying here. We absolutely LOVE coming back here - the view of the vines is spectacular and Karen really has everything stocked up around the house. It’s all about those little touches - like the local produce for breakfast that she arranges and the local coffee beans. The place has everything you need. It’s so tranquil and secluded but is centrally located so you’re still a short drive away from all the wineries, supermarket and local restaurants and cafes. Can’t wait to come back! :)"
7055506,268398299,2018-05-25,161503967,Luke,Lovely cottage and a very accommodating and hospitable host :)

7055506,288019803,2018-07-09,22340075,Ruby,"I would highly recommend staying at Under the vines B&B, the place is perfectly located to explore the Barossa valley and is set on a beautiful vineyard. The place was clean and had everything you could think of including a spa, tv, Foxtel, and lovely kitchen. It is the perfect place to relax after spending the day wine tasting and eating!! Karen also sent us a fantastic list of wineries and restaurant recommendations which were much appreciated!!"
7055506,294304344,2018-07-22,42815486,Kristina,The property is set in a vineyard and a little bit out of Tanunda town centre. It is perfectly located for touring the Barossa. Karen is a fabulous host supplying the most amazing breakfast provisions of local produce and setting the fire ready to light in the wood stove upon our arrival. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
7055506,298026311,2018-07-29,52254076,Max,"This is our second stay at Karen's, as we simply had to come back after our first stay was far too short.  This cottage is easily the best we have stayed at in airbnb; Karen is very generous and has everything you could want to have a comfortable stay.  The wood fire and large spa bath was particularly great for our winter  visit. Absolutely lovely, and definitely recommended. "

Breakfast goods were the best quality as was the port and coffee. Loved every second and wanted to stay forever. This is the place to stay in the Barossa, with that personal touch and vineyard feel ❤"
7055506,309842252,2018-08-19,199117923,David,"Under the Vines is an amazing place to stay, being close to Tanunda. Set on a working vineyard, but so quiet and peaceful with great views.

7055506,336084129,2018-10-14,17740875,Chris,"Beautiful place nestled amongst the vines, secluded yet very central and close to everything. Great place for two couples or two friends. Karen was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout... also very quick with communicating. There were lovely touches with chocolates and also a large amount of breakfast supplies. Unfortunately we didn’t really take advantage of the fresh ingredients left for a hearty big breakfast. Would definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks again Karen."

7055506,343801343,2018-11-02,218374693,Gareth,"Beautiful place. The building looked small from the outside as you would expect for an Airbnb guest house, but inside its so spacious. The beds and the bathroom are big! Spa bath and double shower are both a treat. Breakfast kit was left in the fridge which was so nice! Wife and I might come back just for the Airbnb.

Only downside is, as mentioned, the bugs. There are quite a few spiders and centipedes and all so if that's a deal breaker for you, be advised.

Definitely would recommend"
7055506,354463628,2018-12-01,71439249,Saranya,"Karen's B&B was a perfect retreat in the Barossa. The two rooms had large beds and ample linen and towels. The bathroom is very large too and is perfect for couples. We had a delicious breakfast daily consisting of fresh vegetables, eggs and bacon with fresh bread and oats. The little touches around the place with the barrel of port make it very divine! Dinner and breakfast with the view of the vineyard made our stay extra special. Would definitely come back !"

The accommodation was very clean with everything you need for self catering if you feel inclined to cook. Karen kindly left us quality supplies for a cooked breakfast along with milk, juice, tea, coffee and a big bowl of sweets.

Bed was comfortable and we both slept soundly. Karen’s attention to detail is excellent with lots of small thoughtful touches which made our stay really special.

We had one night and wished we’d stayed two. Beautiful place for a romantic getaway with a spa and fire. Karen was easy to communicate with and the extra touches where brilliant. First place I haven’t had to use my own candles in the bath. Lovely. Breakfast was plentiful and fresh. Thanks for everything.

7297171,45221243,2015-08-31,23689788,Tim,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kathryn and Johns place over a long weekend in August. We were made to feel very much at home and they were very helpful with questions we had. They were so generous to  offer to take us to a local wine show which was one of the highlights of our trip. The house is an old classic with high ceilings and lots of room. The room itself was large, the bed was very comfortable and it had stunning views out over the acreage and some vineyards. The property is in angaston, a pretty little town in the barossa valley which is a short drive to many surrounding vineyards.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a more authentic experience when experiencing the barossa valley."

Their home is close enough to stroll into the main street of Angaston and still be surrounded by picturesque vineyards and hills typical of the Barossa. We'd love to return.

Because we were there for an overnight stay only, and had to leave early the next morning, we didn't get a chance to properly explore the area. Maybe next time. Thank you for having us."

Jonathan and his wife were great, easygoing and charming hosts! They had plenty of good advices for us. They have to dogs: An older quiet one and a younger wild one. Even if he jumps up on you he will not harm you. Both are friendly dogs. Angaston itself is a small and lovely village that we liked very much. There is a good butcher, cheese store, bakery and café. Angaston is well situated to explore the barossa valley. We would definitely come back - we felt really comfortable!"

Jonathan has a fountain of knowledge of local attractions and hidden gem. We were very fortunate to get all the travel recommendations from him.

Our room was spacious, with a beautiful outlook and comfortable bed with lovely linen. We enjoyed relaxing in their formal lounge. It was a treat to see inside of a beautiful old farmhouse like theirs. 
The share bathroom was not a problem. The location is very handy to eateries and wineries. We specifically wanted somewhere close to the Barossa Farmers Market, so this was perfect. Thank you Jonathan and Kate for sharing your lovely home with us. "

We had the run of the beautiful house and gardens, our toddler could play with the dogs; altogether it felt like a home away from home. The location of the house is perfect to explore the Barossa and surrounds. Shops are a short walk away and Jon recommended several great wineries. His Barossa Taste Sensations wine tour was fantastic and I can recommend it highly to discover hidden gems of wineries! Thank you for making our holiday memorable and we'll definitely be back.

Their property was like a country escape; it felt cosy and safe, and the room and facilities were clean. Jon was very knowledgeable about the region and recommended excellent wineries to visit. Angaston centre is just a 5-10 minute walk where there are great cafes. There is a neat biking/walking track very close to the property which would be perfect if you were keen on biking around town or travelling town to town. I would highly recommend Pembury homestead for your next stay in the Barossa valley. "

They shared an evening meal with me and even took me to meet friends of theirs one evening for pizza.  Great time!  The house is old and has a lot of character which I liked.  Very quiet area which is perfect if you want some peace and quiet.  They have 2 dogs but the youngest one is the one you'll see most and he is very playful.  Jon and Kate are great hosts and are more than willing to share information about the Barossa Valley.  I would most definitely go back and stay with them again if given the chance.  Thanks to both of them for a memorable stay.

The room is spacious with high ceilings and very complete (desk, small sofa, tea maker, closet and of course a bed). The bed was reasonably comfortable, but if your partner is tossing and turning this could shake you up quite a bit. We could also make use of the lounge across the hall, with a very homey atmosphere a large sofa and a tv set (we did not try this) and some touristic brochures. It seems the hosts have their own living, so we had this room to ourselves. You can use the coffee maker in the kitchen and store your supply in the fridge. We had our dinner and breakfast in the garden, which is a very romantic setting. 

It's a 10 minute walk to the village center with a restaurant, a supermarket and other shops and the like. On Saturday morning there is a farmers market one village down, good to stock up before you head further North. 

The place is clean and a pleasant space to be. "

Their home is in a wonderful location- very close to Angaston- and was even more beautiful than expected. We spent some time chatting with them in the evening but they were very easy going and we would have felt comfortable enough to do our own thing if we wished. As our time in the area was very limited the tips that they gave us made this short time very special. We would definitely recommend a stay with Jonathon and Kate.
7297171,70461854,2016-04-17,11833720,Maria,"Jonathan and Kate have a brilliant home with lots of character. They were very friendly and engaging with great local advice.

After going out for dinner, we returned to the house & were invited to join them & their friends around a bonfire. It was such a great country experience. I would recommend this place to everyone, we had the best stay! Such a comfortable bed too - had the best nights sleep. Thanks so much Jonathan & Kate!"

Situated right in the centre of the Barossa it was a short drive to most places and you can even walk down to Angaston. Communication before we arrived was great. Jonathan and Kate are very friendly hosts and we enjoyed our time there very much. Just missing the downpour of rain we had the opportunity to wander around their property with their dogs, alpacas and sheep one afternoon which we loved. A nice and cosy house! We would definitely recommend this place to our friends :)"

We enjoyed our stay at Pembury Homestead. The room is as per the photo - high ceiling, clean and spacious for two (just right for three). There are plenty of power outlets for your electronics too.  The view from the window was very great (it was cold and wet the day we arrived so we didn't go explore the garden). 

We went to Pindarie Wines based on Jonathan and Kate's recommendation and we weren't disappointed - one of the best meals we had in SA!

Their historical home is truly unique, with great character. Kate and Jonathan have been the best hosts, insuring I had the best time during my stay. They were forthcoming with recommendations, which allowed me to really make the most of my short stay at the Barossa. Their children were so lovely, and mustn't forget their 2 gorgeous dogs. The highlight for me, was sitting in their back garden one evening, enjoying a glass of wine with Kate and Jonathan. They helped make my short stay a memorable one. I can't thank them enough! Best place to stay in the heart of the Barossa Valley."

7297171,192125883,2017-09-10,23174829,Richard,"Jonathan & Kate's property is about as picturesque as you can get. You could be in Europe if the gums were pines or oak!
 
They have alpacas sheep and a goat that thinks it is a sheep!

They are a warm friendly couple, so much so that we invited them to join us for dinner on the Saturday evening.

The only drawback was the shared bathroom, but to me that was a minor issue.

Excellent value for money!"

7297171,220567035,2017-12-23,152104390,Joy,"Pembury Cottage is a beautiful relaxing and homely environment, decorated simply, but so stylishly. Every room had such lovely charm. We felt at home and relaxed with hosts who were able to detect our need for some conversation but also recognised our need for time out and space. That is quite a skill. We loved riding around the Barossa on our bikes and coming home to the gorgeous kitchen to cook in with all the necessary things at hand, or wander down the Main Street in Angaston and eat out at a restaurant. The relaxed nature of the holiday in an area like the Barossa meant we could do as much or as little as we wanted and either was great. You will not be disappointed. Pembury Cottage and its owners take the guess work out of whether you will have a good time...all you need is here, the rest is up to you."

Their drive is literally on the bike trail which takes you all the way to Gawler. If you choose to do the bike ride there is nothing better than getting back for a shower and hitting Angastons restaurants ( 5min walk), then taking a bottle back to the house and chilling out overlooking the hills for the rest of the evening."
7297171,237963790,2018-02-24,158186525,Alan,Pembury Cottage is very tastefully furnished. Bright and contemporary. Excellent for restful stay and we’ll positioned for tours of Borossa Valley. Angaston a great little town

8053447,178176974,2017-08-05,31765247,Linda,"Maryann's place is in walking distance to the main street in Tanunda and short stroll to a bakery to grab some great breakfast pastries.  Both Maryann and her husband have great tips about which wineries to visit in the area so make sure you ask them!
The house is lovely, comfortable, spacious and warm (and so clean).  I have to make special mention of the very very comfortable bedding!
Even though you're sharing Maryann's home,  she doesn't impose herself on your stay and the space provided is very private and secure - you can have as much or as little interaction as you please.
My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.  Maryann even had cheese, olives and chocolate waiting for us :)  I'll be back next visit to the Barossa.  Thanks again Maryann."

There was only one thing I wasn't a huge fan of and that being that the accommodation is at the front of their house and there is just a sheet up in the hallway separating the accommodation from the hosts but didn't hear a peep from them. But for the price can't really complain, didn't bother us really as we were just sleeping there. All in all, really nice!"

8153197,46985046,2015-09-14,1823405,Trudy,"Upon arrival Christa greeted us with the key, showed us around the attached cottage and then presented us with a hot freshly made orange cake ! A country welcome indeed.
This is an old cottage which is attached to the main farm house, but is self- contained.  It has it’s own entrance and when you sit on the verandah at the back your view is of a field of vines.
The bathroom is huge and old fashioned, but the water is hot with good pressure.
The kitchen does not have a stove, but has an electric frypan, in which you can fry your fresh farm eggs which they give you.
When we went it was cold, so it was lovely to sit around the log fire which was set up for us.
Everything was very clean and we had a most enjoyable stay of one night.
"
8153197,48758671,2015-09-28,42358141,Junshuo,Lovely stay ! Thank you for your hospitality.

Had everything we could've wanted.
"
8153197,56157973,2015-12-09,39503528,Fiona,"Spacious and comfortable, it was very hot when we were there but the cottage was nice and cool.  We got to enjoy a thunderstorm from the verandah and watch the galahs enjoy it. Christa was very generous with food supplied. Great stay."
8153197,58175375,2016-01-01,4795539,Alex & Dina,Christa was the perfect host! Very welcoming and friendly. The house is very spacious with a nice terrace overlooking the vineyards. Christa left a bowl of berries freshly picked from their garden on the kitchen table and shared their handmade paté with us! Just delicious!! Lovely experience - a great spot to spend time in Barossa Valley. 
8153197,59315692,2016-01-09,39654927,Jim & Kathy,"Naimanya cottage was a fantastic stay. A good location close to all the wineries. Comfortable and serene. Definitely would go back for more. 

"
8153197,60486481,2016-01-24,4984577,Kristel,"Loved our stay, Christa and Leon were lovely, really enjoyed morning visits from their beautiful dog Rusty."
8153197,63220657,2016-02-21,8251594,Benjamin,"We'd recommend Christa's place to anyone looking for cozy, low key accommodation. We stayed three nights with our 11 month old son and felt right at home. Everything was clean, well looked after, thoughtfully prepared, comfortable and incredibly welcoming. 

The location is fantastic on top of the hill, with easy access to amazing wineries and local eateries a short drive away.

The breakfast foods that Christa supplied were all high quality, local products, including beautiful eggs from her own chickens.

We enjoyed checking out the chickens, sheep and bulls grazing in the paddock and our son absolutely adored their very excitable dog, Rusty.

Thank you Christa, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and appreciate your hospitality at this very busy time of the year for winemakers."
8153197,65014459,2016-03-10,6361710,Thom,Staying at Christa's unique farm stay was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had! Christa and rusty went out of their way to make us feel at home immediately. We can highly recommend it for a unique Barossa experience.
8153197,65767701,2016-03-17,11669008,David,"The cottage is a beautiful little place on a farm/vineyard outside town.    Sitting on the back porch and having breakfast watching the sun rise over the vineyard was one of our best memories of the trip.  It's a little bit of a drive to the big winery areas but no big deal and a scenic road for the most part.  Owners are wonderful and very nice, gave us lots of recommendations about the area and things to do, and of course about wine!  Breakfast is included but is ""cook your own"", Christa gave us a nice assortment of local eggs, bacon, bread, coffee, etc and we made our breakfast on our own schedule.  Kitchen is small but adequate, no real stove just electrics.

The house itself is cute but very old, like 1860's old.  The owners live in the other half of the building which is one of several additions to the original house.  If I had any complaint about the place it's that the bathroom probably dates to shortly after the invention of indoor plumbing.  Perfectly usable and not an issue for us, but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing it's the only complaint I have.  We would definitely consider staying here again if we're ever back in the Barossa Valley."
8153197,66044545,2016-03-19,54428481,Rita,The host made us feel very welcome.Friendly and accomodation was much larger than I expected.Good sized rooms Beds very comfortable.Well equiped.Beautiful views and so close to 2 small towns with excellent eateries.
8153197,66870876,2016-03-25,11768376,Grant,"If you don't feel you would enjoy peace and quiet in a wonderful location, waking up to birdsong at sunrise straight out over vineyards from you verandah, wonderful hospitality with fresh breakfast produce (outstanding local bacon, eggs etc), then this may not be th place for you!! As for us we wish we had more time to enjoy the area and hospitality shown by our hosts and would hope to return again when next visiting from the UK."
8153197,73914075,2016-05-11,63030976,Lynne,"
Great place to stay, large airy rooms, lovely open fire and the view over the Vineyard is charming. Christa is a welcoming and generous host, setting the fire every day and making sure all provisions are stocked up. It was blowing a gale on one of our days and Christa had thoughtfully put the heater on soo when we arrived back cold and damp it was lovely and warm "
8153197,74556308,2016-05-15,9860797,Billy,"Great location with easy access to vineyards and towns of the Barossa region.Lovely setting on a working farm,complete with adorable kelpie.Christa made us feel very welcome with a well stocked kitchen and fridge,which was replenished daily.Lots of information about local attractions from Christa herself and written material.The cottage itself is cosy and  comfortably accommodates two couples.Would love to visit again and stay longer."
8153197,83523829,2016-07-03,24771774,John,"We had a delightful stay at Naimanya Cottage. The Cottage was just as shown in the pictures and about a 10-15 minute drive out of Tanunda. Access to vineyards and other Barossa attractions was all pretty easy. Being on a working farm/vineyard added to the charm. Christa was an excellent host - great with communication about the booking, and gave us really good directions on how to the somewhat remote cottage. She provided bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, milk, cereals, tea, coffee, fruit, fresh bread etc each day. We had an open fire each night was a real winner!   We would definitely stay here again."
8153197,86408313,2016-07-16,9252024,Colin,Thanks Christa for the opportunity for a quiet and relaxing holiday.

8153197,91352557,2016-08-05,77398488,Lynda,"I wanted a quiet place to relax and the stay at Naimanya provided exactly that. The provisions were great and we wanted for nothing. Included was a lovely german cake. While it was slightly off the beaten track it was only a short drive to some of the best restaurants and attractions. Having a fire set up for the evening was great, there is nothing nicer than a warm fire to end the day."
8153197,95692426,2016-08-20,65289886,Dace,"We loved staying at Christa's B&B. A simple but very charming place; warm and cosy with delightful views across a vineyard, garden and farmland. Christa was so easy to talk to you & supplied more fresh eggs, fruit, vegetables, bread and cake than we could eat. We'd recommend it to anyone."

Christa was a wonderful host, filling the kitchen with delicious local produce for breakfast and everything we could ask for. The cottage was very spacious and cosy we couldn't recommend staying here enough. "
8153197,109649625,2016-10-22,46356706,Alison,"A wonderful place for a much needed rest and quiet getaway. Christa's attention to detail was impressive, and we (a couple with 7 month old baby) were made to feel most welcome.  Amazing how restorative a couple of nights in front of the fire with a glass of wine can be!"
8153197,115766150,2016-11-26,72409954,Wendy,"Thank you Christa for a very relaxing stay in your beautiful cottage.Views soothing.Abundance of goodies in the fridge and on the table,couldn't fault a thing.I was reluctant to light the fire as it was set so attractively but couldn't resist.Forget to tell you how lovely your flowers arrangement was."
8153197,124079169,2017-01-01,9974434,Amelia,"My husband and I had a perfect 5 days in the Barossa staying on Christa's wonderful farm and vineyard. We appreciated the fresh breakfast provisions, locally sourced (some from the farm!) every morning. Thank you Christa for sharing your home with us. Close to everything yet isolated with a lovely view over the Riesling grapevines."
8153197,133991191,2017-02-25,88644249,Louise,"The perfect place to stay to dip your toe into the Barossa. The place is quiet and feels secluded, and Christa's food supplies help to whet your appetite! We had a lovely weekend - thanks again for your hospitality."
8153197,138467871,2017-03-19,54807865,Hui Lan,"We love Christa's property. It is close to The Barossa but away from the main town. The property is full of character. We love the fresh eggs and tomatoes that Christa provides from her farm for brekkie. Rusty, her pet dog, is extremely friendly. Everyone make us feel very comfortable and welcomes us warmly."
8153197,145348629,2017-04-17,110232644,Katie,"You won't be disappointed when you stay at Christa's b and b. Christa is a wonderful host, provides fresh goods for breakfast which many are replaced daily. The eggs are from her own hens . The views are to die for and there is so much wildlife! The shower is easy to access as you don't have to climb into it and the toilet is sort of separate around the corner in the bathroom! So someone can use the toilet while someone else uses the shower which is a great system. There is a national park about a 10 min walk when you turn right out the property which has LOTS OF KANGAROOS hoping around, eating, but make sure u go an hour before sunset to see them. The property is in easy reach of every where in the barossa and sepplesfield has a beautiful drive down to it with gorgeous trees. Highly recommended this place "
8153197,149194567,2017-05-03,124203095,Erin,"The house was perfect!  It was clean and the area was quiet and relaxing.  Christa provided all of the makings for breakfast every morning.  We had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend it.  We didn't have a car so taxi fares into town were quite expensive so our only recommendation is if you are staying here, have use of a car.  Great value for money!"
8153197,159905310,2017-06-12,60577275,Nick,"Thank you for having us Christa, Erin and I had a lovely break staying at Naimanya. The breakfast was delicious, and having the fire made each day was a nice touch. 

There is plenty of room and bedding, so its good to know we will be able to bring the kids next time!

We loo forward to coming back for another stay sometime soon! :)"
8153197,168110713,2017-07-09,55089013,Alice,"Christa was an amazing host. Stayed up really late when our flight was delayed so she could let us in and give us a tour of the house. Provided a wonderful fresh breakfast each morning and cleaned the place during the day when we were out. The house is a beautiful old cottage, with a great fire place and heating in each room. Christa even cooked us some beautiful apple slice on arrival, and left a gorgeous bottle of shiraz for us to enjoy with dinner.

Would recommend staying here to anyone wanting a quiet stay, close to wineries. We will definitely be staying again.

"
8153197,205298746,2017-10-21,27986773,Amy,Christas place was exactly what we were after. I would definitely stay here again and the small thoughtful touches were great. We were left with supplies for breakfast by either grown on the farm or local produce. We felt at home and loved being on a farm away from Tunanda and Angustown. Both towns were not far and definitely worth exploring. Gorgeous area and a great location in the Barossa. We only stayed 2 nights but I recommend 3-4 nights.
8153197,210982204,2017-11-12,27079629,Colleen,"Christa's place was in a fantastic location, out of the main towns but still only a 10 minute drive away. Christa's knowledge of the area certainly came in handy when planning our day and the Rolf Binder Riesling that was left for us in the fridge was delicious.

And what can we say about breakfast. It was so good! Eggs from her farm, delicious bacon, homemade jams and breads. She certainly went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing stay. Thanks again Christa!"
8153197,218083608,2017-12-11,42948187,Meryl,"The Naimanya cottage is absolutely stunning. It has impeccable views with a cosy cottage interior. The location is perfect as it offers a quiet country stay whilst only being 10mins away from main areas. 

Christa is a wonderful and generous host. The best Air BnB host we've ever had! Definitely a place worth requesting!"
8153197,220803052,2017-12-24,62125476,Martha,"We loved staying at Christa’s! From the beautiful cottage, amazing views, and thoughtful touches, you will Not be disappointed with this delightful place!"
8153197,224943288,2018-01-04,161673070,Jamie,"Really nice place to stay while exploring the Barossa. Quite close to all the wineries but you still feel like your secluded. House has everything you need with some lovely thoughtful touches. Host is friendly and helpful. Annie the dog is a legend,"
8153197,228675491,2018-01-20,43465712,Phoebe,"Total relaxation! The verandah views are amazing and Annie the dog is adorable! The provided breakfast and bottle of wine were delicious and our stay was very comfortable. Lovely to explore the farm and meet your animals, views are beautiful :) Highly reccomend! Phoebe & Lachie "
8153197,233754416,2018-02-11,164732205,Correnna,"Christas place is a hidden piece of old fashion paradise. Great hospitality, local produce left daily, great host, a beautiful kelpie, annie, and all the time in the world. I loved that we could do so much, or so little, it was very relaxing in an authentically old world atmostphere. Thankyou christa"
8153197,235772946,2018-02-17,2096660,Janet,"This is a wonderful country retreat, with exceptionally warm country hospitality. Christa was a wonderful host and we will definitely be returning, again and again."
8153197,243991982,2018-03-17,14505174,Megan,"We absolutely loved staying at Christa's! We were with another couple for the weekend, visiting the Barossa Valley - and could not have picked a more picture perfect place to stay. 

Her house is clean, historic and beautiful. It overlooks a the rolling hills of the Barossa and Eden Valley. Christa herself is a winemaker - so some of the grapes on her property are used in wines you may have the opportunity to try! 

She was extremely helpful and responsive on check-in, and even though we were visiting in the middle of Vintage (busy season) she still made time to give us a tour of her family winery.

Keep in mind - the house is up on a big hill (hence the awesome views) so if you're doing a tour you'll be about a 10-15 min drive to a lot of the wineries near Tanunda. 

We loved Christa's place and would definitely stay there again the next time we visit the Barossa! 

**she also has the cutest Kelpie puppy called Annie!"
8153197,251383053,2018-04-08,9495305,Leigh,"Christa was an amazing host - plenty of thoughtful touches and genuine consideration about our stay and experience. 

The cottage is historic, and could do with some small touches to make more user-friendly e.g. larger sofa in lounge room, comfy chairs on the deck for afternoon vino. 

All in all we felt very looked after and loved our time in the Barossa. Thanks Christa!"
8153197,262459249,2018-05-09,63325540,Ruth,"A quiet, rural outlook, which is very peaceful.  I would recommend it to all.  Christa was a great host."
8153197,263791670,2018-05-13,29820705,Ben,Cozy and very charming place among beautiful scenery. Great place to stay for a weekend exploring the Barossa Valley.
8153197,266292706,2018-05-19,50176105,Otto,This was the perfect space to explore the Barossa Valley and had a beautiful view! The host was very helpful with recommendations for exploring the area and supplied us with yummy farm foods.
8153197,268094948,2018-05-23,45319315,Elise,"Christa is a fantastic host, the cottage is a nice escape from Tanunda, located in a lovely quiet valley - fresh brekkies everyday and equipped with everything you need."
8153197,280692662,2018-06-24,72938971,Hamish,We had an incredible few days in the Barossa and very much enjoyed our stay with Christa. We were after an authentic Barossa experience and couldn’t have been more pleased with the cottage. Drinking wine by the open fire in the evenings was just what we needed after a big day touring the vineyards. By staying with Christa you not only get access to a great cottage but she is also a well renowned winemaker only too willing to share her knowledge of the region. A great experience. We’ll be back.
8153197,326687536,2018-09-23,69465389,Shane,"We can highly recommend a stay at Christa's cottage. Staying on the farm which is within easy reach of the Barossa and Eden Valley's (10 mins) , provided us with a very relaxing experience. 
Our hosts Christa and Leon were very helpful and friendly. The cottage had provisions for a full cooked breakfast with fresh farm eggs. The open fire in the lounge room also created a lovely atmosphere.  A raised veranda offers fantastic views of their vineyard and surrounding farms.
There are plenty of walking trails in the area for those who want to experience the native wild life and bush land.

Shane & Marianne"
8153197,331900884,2018-10-04,43817014,Rachel,"My partner and I spent 3 nights at Christa's place and had a wonderful time. It's a cozy, old cottage with a lot of character and a beautiful view over a vineyard. Christa was friendly and welcoming as was Annie, the Kelpie! The breakfast provided for us to cook was fresh and it was fully restocked each day. The location is at the top of a hill so the drive to the vineyards takes a little extra time, but we didn't mind because the views descending into the valley were beautiful. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
8153197,336086016,2018-10-14,13939675,Oliver,"Would highly recommend. The cottage is in a beautiful location overlooking vineyards, is rustic and provides more of an authentic Barossa experience. Christa the host is extremely friendly and responsive she also provided a ton of extras which made the stay even more pleasant incl fresh ingredients for breakfast each morning, the fire made up each day and wine from the local vineyard. Would definitely stay again! Olly"

8153197,342545908,2018-10-28,161686635,Maddie,"We enjoyed our short & sweet stay at Naimanya, the cottage was undeniably spotless, clean and well upkept. It was a cool experience to stay in a building dating back to mid 1800's! The country setting was peaceful and only a 10-20 minute driving distance of Angaston and Tanunda. We loved Annie the dog's cute little visits when we were outside. We appreciated the included breakfast provisions that were restocked everyday. The cottage was attached to the family home, and has been modernised with touches of a pump pressurised shower of rainwater, reverse cycle, wifi, and heat lamp in bathroom; which was a cool setup in itself with toilet in the same room but concealed in the corner at the same time by an original wall. The lookout off Tanunda creek road not far from residence was awesome at the time of sun-set.
"
8153197,345751336,2018-11-06,3316167,Jemi,Christa's bed and breakfast was fantastic. Many nice touches throughout our stay and an amazing location to base ourselves. We also managed to taste some of Christa's wine and were fascinated by her story. Thanks for a beautiful stay!
8153197,400683388,2019-01-12,24684920,Daen,"We really loved our stay here! Christa was a great host and was very accomodating. We especially loved the home grown eggs, bacon, fresh juice and milk in the fridge on arrival."
8153197,430592825,2019-03-31,5200343,Lou,"We had a wonderful weekend in Christa’s cottage, thoroughly enjoying ourselves. It’s such a gorgeous place and Christa is a wonderful host. We especially loved her tour at their winery. We just loved the fabulous brekkie provisions, the wine and the thoughtful touches with sage and figs from the garden when we said we were cooking that night. Thanks again. Lou xx"

8153197,457315201,2019-05-24,33529141,Candace,Had a great stay at Christa’s cottage. Beautiful sunrises and sunsets over the vineyards gave us some gorgeous pictures. The cottage was comfy and the breakfast provisions were generous and yummy. Definitely check out the wines produced from the vines on Christa’s property. They were beautiful as well.
8153197,483886512,2019-07-08,11278387,Michael,"Thank you Christa for being a wonderful host and looking after us on our weekend stay in the Barossa! The house was quaint and lovely, with a huge roaring fire every night and delicious fresh local produce to cook up a storm with. Mornings and evenings on the veranda were a highlight. We had a ball, highly recommend!"
8153197,558348873,2019-11-02,183037414,Rosalie,We loved our stay with Christa. Her home was a great base from which to explore the Barossa. We loved all the thoughtful touches including the fresh bread and eggs she delivered each day.

Christa had it all set up ready to go which was such a nice touch. Great breakfast selections as well for the morning and she gave some great tips on things to do in the region. Highly recommend and would stay again."

8616563,126049786,2017-01-08,52987608,Mark,"Kym and Steve are amazing hosts. We required an on-the-spot booking, and were more than happy to accommodate. Instant responses whenever we had questions which was a very big help.

As the description states, the beautiful home keeps its Circa 1890s feel with its layout and decor, with the added bonus of a modern kitchen and spa facilities.

The short walk to the main street was also very convenient.

Perfect for travelling families."
8616563,136018371,2017-03-07,108742998,Trina,"Kym's place felt like home. It was centrally located but in a quiet location. It had everything we needed. It was clean, described perfectly and was beautifully decorated. We loved it. "
8616563,168679968,2017-07-10,4200939,Krystal,"This place is amazing - everything you could possibly need & more! 
We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and can't recommend it enough, so homely and comfortable. Close to the main street (Murray Street) but still quiet...a great place to stay to relax & enjoy everything that the Barossa has to offer."
8616563,172430819,2017-07-21,115606146,Brigitta,"THANKS for a wonderful stay. True to its name we had fantastic night of indeed treasured memories. Will definitely be back and hope for an even longer stay next time.

8616563,204391560,2017-10-18,38197407,Melissa,"We have stayed at this house before. It’s really close to the Main Street so we were able to just wander up the road and grab breakfast or supplies from the supermarket.
There are supplies of juice, milk, tea, coffee and cookies provided, which is incredibly handy.
There have been more air conditioners added since we stayed there last which was great since we had some very warm days during our stay. 
The last time we stayed, we only had one child (14 months old), this time we had 2 children (3 & 16 months old) who like to get into everything. I don’t think we realized how much antique type furniture was in the house. It’s probably not really a toddler friendly house from that regard."
8616563,216009005,2017-12-02,3190183,Rosie,"A lovely house in a very convenient location. We didn't meet Kym as we arrived at night and were attending a wedding. However, the house is spotless, comfortable and close to shops and restaurants. There was milk, juice, tea and coffee and biscuits  available for us when we arrived.The garden is very pleasant and we enjoyed our stay there very much."

The bed was very comfortable with crispy clean sheets, nice.
Pet friendly status is always a must for us, good secure garden, but sadly the garden itself is a bit neglected. 
Kym was very pleasant to deal with, prompt communication from booking to check out. Very helpful when we had a last minute addition to our plans. 
Thank you very much Kym."

9264671,67451484,2016-03-29,19869505,Ashley,"This place is exactly as described - basic (small studio, no TV etc) but has been recently renovated, is clean and modern. Very short walk to the town/shops. Tracey was really helpful and easily contactable when we struggled to initially find the place! She also left us handy things we needed over the weekend (milk, coffee, wine!) The studio can be a little bit noisy if the main house is booked as (I think) the studio is next to their kitchen/laundry."
9264671,68858071,2016-04-07,19500087,Charli,Barossa Seasons Studio is a great rest stop while enjoying the surrounding Barossa Valley. The room is a fair size with a comfy bed and large bathroom. The only trouble is finding the place but Tracey came to the rescue and explained how to find it - it's quite easy but just needs a house number displayed.
9264671,101908891,2016-09-15,94894707,Alison,"Tracey was a lovely host! Very responsive and helpful. The Barossa Seasons Studio was a compact living area which was clean, comfy and cosy. I would recommend to anyone to wants to visit and stay in the Barossa Valley for a couple of nights. It very close to the shops, restaurants and cafes just as decribed. Thanks a bunch Tracey!"
9264671,106194735,2016-10-04,23843380,Nathan,Tracey was a wonderful host. The studio was perfect for a couple to use as a base to explore the Barossa and a short few minutes walk into the centre of town.

9264671,137666255,2017-03-16,380707,Joshua,While Tracy was not there to let us and she made it very easy for us to access the unit and when we had a small problem she came right over. For us the large bathroom was the highlight of the unit. She provided several dinner recommendations and in the morning we were about half a kilometre from several breakfast options.

The room is on the main street  of Tanunda but there is almost no traffic at night and the convenience makes up for any noise. This is a great spot and we loved our stay in Tanunda.

My husband and I stayed at the Barossa Valley for our very first wedding anniversary.
Tracey was a wonderful host from the beginning. She offered us an upgrade to the Marble Room from our original Idyll Studio booking. The Marble Room is in a stunning sandstone house with a large master bedroom, comfy lounge room with Netflix access, spacious bathroom, and a dining room stocked with continental breakfast, bubbly and strawberries. Wifi was also available. 
The property in walking distance to the town's cafes, shops and restaurants.

The home has a great energy that makes you feel so comfortable. The cupboards are full with everything you need to live like you’re at home and entertain friends which we did for my 40th birthday.

Two living and dining rooms with ample seating, a lovely front and backyard to watch the sunset and sunrise. We were in awe of the view from the huge glass living room looking across the landscape. Cafes easy walking distance and the house was spotless. The house is a very cool 1970s timepiece yet so modern. Everyone enjoyed a great night sleep. Thank you Tracey"
9453124,101351889,2016-09-12,5101334,Monica,"Barossa Seasons is the prefect house for a family or a large group, especially if you want to cook at home. It is so well appointed. Tracey has thought of absolutely everything you may need. The view from the back of the house is lovely, it is really close to the shopping strip, has parking for multiple cars. There is a lot of internal living space, good quality furniture, large bedrooms with plenty of really clean linen and it is well heated.  Netflix and wireless internet, and outdoor furniture and BBQ. It was great and Tracey responded quickly to any requests we made. "
9453124,166240546,2017-07-03,492501,Caitlin,"We loved our stay at Barossa Idyll in Tanunda. It was perfect for our group of 8 and the layout of bedrooms / bathrooms was perfect for a large group.
The location of the house is fantastic and only short walk to beautiful restaurants and cafes.

The view of the Barossa is amazing, and I had a feeling of freedom the whole time I was there. You can see how much love and attention has gone into making the house welcoming. I appreciated the little things that you thought of.

Thank you so much again. I recommend staying here to anyone looking for a little peace and privacy in the country. "
9687272,64072714,2016-02-29,31009638,Jess,We had a wonderful weekend at Casa Mia. The house is full of charm and is also very functional. The deck is perfect for meals or drinks and looks out over vineyards.  The location is very private but only a short drive to town. Our friends complimented out choice of accommodation every day we stayed at Casa Mia.
9687272,66419601,2016-03-22,38874102,Mackenzie,"Casa Mia was perfect in every way. I had family visiting from Canada and wanted to show them a true Barossa experience- this place exceeded our expectations. Beautiful setting amongst rolling vines, very peaceful and a gorgeous restored cottage. Georgina has an eye for detail, even left us produce for our first breakfast!
 I would recommend anyone stay here and I myself would love to come back! "

9687272,76829089,2016-05-29,32944318,Fiona,"The house is gorgeous.  Set on a lovely dirt road in amongst the vines, you feel miles from anywhere despite being just minutes to everything in the Barossa.  The beds were so comfy - we all slept so well.  And the breakfast left for us was lovely - that bacon, mmmm...  Thank you and I'm sure we'll stay again!"
9687272,81385851,2016-06-22,68001048,Emmi,"Casa Mia Barossa was the most incredible home to stay at during our time in the Barossa Valley! Georgina was so kind to leave fresh fruit and food for our arrival and the house was so clean and tidy.

The house was beautiful and very clean.  We also found it quite spacious. The provisions for the first breakfast were excellent and made us feel at home. We had a wonderful stay. 
9687272,85459024,2016-07-11,6462959,Joanna,We had a great stay at Casa Mia.  The house was in beautiful condition and everything was clear and easy to find.  We have already recommended the house to friends and will definitely want to return on our next stay in the Barossa.  
9687272,94020535,2016-08-14,23551144,Michael And Kirsty,"Amazing place. Better then the photos suggest. House was great for 3 couples for a weekend in Barossa. Location was spectacular. There were also more facilities at the house then the listing suggests. It's really well set up. Honestly, for my trip to the Barossa, if this house isn't available, I'll be changing my dates! :) "
9687272,99472563,2016-09-05,78951249,Ryan,"Beautiful place, lovely large gas stove, away from everyone yet close enough to everything when you want it to be. 
"
9687272,101311850,2016-09-12,9542015,Victoria,"This house is perfect for any visit to Barossa! Little drive distance to main wineries and city centre (Tanuda) yet secluded on its own way to make for  an incredibly relaxing getaway. The house itself is spotless, ready to use, and I would agree with other reviews on two things - the beds are so comfy! And the house is even better than the pics show. Finally, Georgina is a message away in case you need her and very easy to communicate with."
9687272,104614973,2016-09-27,41321253,Maree,"Thank you Georgina for our wonderful stay at your home. The rooms and beds were lovely, the home spotless and the amenities you provided very welcome.

9687272,105761526,2016-10-02,2270395,Nevena,"Well, what a joy! For months we'd been looking forward to staying at the gorgeous Casa Mia Barossa, and it's safe to say that, once there, we pretty much instantly fell in love with the cottage. (Love at first sight, if you will!) Not only is it beautiful and cosy, but spacious, clean, homey, comfortable and peaceful. Also, the surrounding views? TO DIE FOR! Not only can you enjoy them from the terrace but, also, the lovely kitchen. (P.S. I need that farmhouse-style sink in my life.) We would definitely stay here again the next time we trek over to Barossa; no doubt. Stunning little abode plain and simple. A big thanks to Georgina for all her help, for the basket of goodies (brekky and other food), and for making us feel at home!"
9687272,125258133,2017-01-04,2016117,Maria,"Awesome house, fantastic views! It looks much better than on the pictures - very clean, recently repaired and fantastic antique pieces of furniture. A lot of space, big bedrooms. Georgina also left us fresh country eggs, milk, bread and fruits- that was so nice!"
9687272,126431857,2017-01-11,46518844,Sam,"What an amazing house!!! Thank you Georgina for letting us stay in your wonderful home. From the minute we arrived, we felt right at home. It was lovely and quiet which was exactly what we were after. It is a very quick drive into town and local wineries, and the local Taxi is familiar with the property so easy to get to and from places without driving! Absolutely breathtaking view, especially at sunset. Definitely recommend staying here, it's everything you could need in a home away from home! "
9687272,127267873,2017-01-16,95577595,Kirsty,Such a beautiful house overlooking the vines. 10 minutes from tanunda and surrounded by exciting wineries. Can't recommend it highly enough. Perfect with kids as very streamlined and kitchen well equipped.
9687272,138056321,2017-03-18,43761064,Ben,Couldn't be happier. Thanks Georgina!
9687272,139537674,2017-03-25,844800,Lesley,"I would highly recommend Georgina's place. It was very easy to check in, she had stocked the fridge with great breakfast starters since we arrived late and no shops were open. The beds were very comfortable, we had everything we needed and it was pure delight to sit on the balcony as the sun was setting, sipping on some local bubbly, listening to Frank Sinatra on the outdoor speakers. We also had some morning visitors of two 'roos which was a treat for our non-Aussie family! Close to lots of great Barossa wineries, we could have spent the whole weekend just zipping around that small area and there would be plenty to do and see."
9687272,147080949,2017-04-24,88565402,Gabrielle,We spent three lovely nights at this property. The views are just spectacular and nice to be a little bit out of the busy-ness of the main town Tanunda. The breakfast provisions provided were lovely too and communication with regards to check in was very quick and easy - Georgina was very accommodating. We hope to be back again in the future! 
9687272,149975004,2017-05-06,37854586,Catherine,"What a beautiful spot, and a wonderful welcoming place to stay. Hightlights include having a warm cuppa on the deck on our first morning, as the sun slowly illuminated the sky. Rows of autumnal grape vines, as far as we could see. Peaceful, secluded, quiet, and effortlessly elegant. I cannot recommend strongly enough."
9687272,153848705,2017-05-22,76786786,Charles,Lovely outlook over vines. Beautiful place and great location.
9687272,175044099,2017-07-28,34329604,Rob,"We had an amazing time staying here. The host was very helpful getting us in on extremely short notice (within 1 hour of making contact!)
The property has character and with its elevated position has great views of the surrounding vineyards. Very close to some amazing wineries/restaurants but we also enjoyed cooking up some meals and sitting out on the deck to soak it all in. Will def come back."
9687272,182964528,2017-08-16,134973817,Scott,"Lovely house, you wouldn't know that you were less than 5 min from the centre of Tanunda."

9687272,221820729,2017-12-27,6594230,Sarah,"This has got to be one of the best Airbnb’s available in South Australia. It’s situated on a vineyard, so the scenery is unreal. It’s beautiful to sit on the deck, wine in hand and relax. 
We loved our stay and highly recommend this property."

9687272,241928002,2018-03-11,158950534,Anne,"Potential guests should know there's no wifi and the last km is on unsealed road. Check with your car hire company.
It's  a sweet house but quite expensive for a basic cottage."
9687272,251978972,2018-04-09,109414162,Angela,"Was a lovely location particularly for our wedding photos with my bridesmaids getting ready in the morning.

It's in an awesome location, especially close to Tanunda, but also easy distance to Nurioopta and other places. It was also nice staying somewhere with history and being virtually in the middle of a vineyard was brilliant. Very peaceful, a perfect place for a cuppa or glass of wine :)"

Located in a rise, overlooking vines and the stunning scenery of the valley. 
The house is well set up with 3 large bedrooms, a large kitchen and separate lounge. The bathroom and kitchen are modern with all amenities one would want. Breakfast provisions are fresh and tasty.

9687272,441404291,2019-04-22,243812760,Kirsty,Casa Mia is a wonderful place to stay for a weekend getaway. It is in a private location but yet only 5 mins away from Tanunda and beautiful wineries. The property was very clean and had everything we needed while there.

Georgina’s property is clean, warm and very convenient. 

We had our 13-month old son stay with us, and the property is very child friendly, too."

Perfectly placed for visiting favorite sites like Seppeltsfield and Maggie Beers Farm Shop. The peaceful views inspire calm and relaxation.  We loved the antique furniture selections and the local artwork.  Looking forward to returning, to restore the balance in a busy life."
9714178,71470894,2016-04-25,24458055,Laura,"Our stay in the Barossa Valley was fantastic, largely due to the phenomenal accommodation in Tanunda. The pictures honestly do not do this home justice. Not only does the decor look like you stepped into a page of Architectural Digest, Yvette is the master of ensuring her guests have every amenity someone could need when away from home with friends (a full kitchen with a nespresso, iron, hairdryers, umbrellas, playing cards, DVD player...the list goes on). The home was more than comfortable for four people (it could easily fit 6); the large outdoor area adds to the immense space already offered. To top it off, the home is less than a 5 min walk into town (3 min to the grocery store) & all of the vineyards we visited were no more than a 15 min drive from the house. Yvette was also incredibly kind and responsive with any questions I had. If I visit the Barossa region again, I will most definitely make a point to rent this home again!"
9714178,87012033,2016-07-18,29426940,Jisue,We stayed at Yvette's place in Tanunda for 3 days and 2 nights for a friends 30th birthday weekend getaway with 6 friends. Yvette's place is absolutely beautiful. Everyone was blown away by how nice the place was when we arrived. Every single corner of the house was amazingly clean and all the appliance and furniture - pretty much the whole house was luxury. Thanks to Yvette we were able to have a delicious breakfast 2 mornings in a row. The fridges and cupboards were stocked with food! The complimentary wine and appetisers were amazing as well. Thank you Yvette for the beautiful house. We all had an amazing time! We will definitely be returning to this place when we come back to Barossa Valley!!
9714178,104821436,2016-09-28,29965545,Jeff,Great cottage 
9714178,106949228,2016-10-08,2004690,Stacey,"This accommodation definitely exceeded our expectations and made our stay over our wedding day absolutely amazing!
It was like a home away from home - a high end home at that! Everything was thought of and the produce supplied upon arrival was fantastic. 
Yvette was very effective to communicate with and we had no issues with checking in or out. We just wished we had stayed longer!
The location is perfect and close to everything on the main street and the house itself is immaculate - very modern and well finished renovations. Thank you so much for a very memorable stay!"
9714178,110017740,2016-10-23,23830566,Marietta,"Sometimes photos don't sell the story well enough, the photos couldnt show you just how fantasticly comfortable this place was. Spotlessly clean, best spot next to a couple of good restaurants, everything you need in the kitchen, including espresso machine.
Highly recommend this to anyone, nothing disappointed."
9714178,125259867,2017-01-04,1678638,Jennifer,"Yvette's place is wonderful! The property is beautiful, new and perfectly maintained. There's great outdoor space for lounging and eating with friends. There were so many thoughtful touches - like the sound system, the breakfast food that was included, the espresso machine, etc. The house is completely fitted out and a pleasure to stay in. The key code access makes check in really easy as well. This is definitely the best Airbnb in Tanunda."
9714178,185143947,2017-08-21,24174632,Kellie,"This place is absolutely stunning!  
3 bedroom, 2 bathroom stunning cottage just out of the centre of Tanunda.
The house itself is very clean, really well provisioned with breakfast and on arrival we were greeted with some wine and cheese!  There is a coffee maker there with George Clooney style Nespresso Pods in generous portions - which is great as we did struggle to find a good coffee in town!  Everything we looked for was there, from a cheese board, to wine glasses, a cooler bag and a cold pack in the freezer for a sore head!! Hehe.
The bathrooms were also well provisioned with excellent, very strong, professional standard hair dryers, exfoliating mitts, and bath salts amongst all the other standard things.  In the laundry there was laundry powder and basic cleaning equipment if needed, as well as a washer/dryer.
The styling in the house and out on the patio is exceptional, so if you are into design, this is the place to go!  We walked away with some lovely styling ideas for our own homes.
To get everywhere:
3 minute walk to a cafe.
5 minute walk to Ferment Asian (You MUST go there for a Chef's menu meal)
3 minute walk to centre of town.
Walking and riding distance to many many wineries.  This location is great for 3 couples or a family."
9714178,189495930,2017-09-02,114459613,Luke,"What an amazing place. It felt like stepping into a Home Beautiful magazine shoot! Absolutely everything was PERFECT. Yvette was an incredibly responsive, attentive and accommodating host from the moment we booked. The place itself was immaculately presented and spotlessly clean. The attention to detail in the way the place has been furnished and appointed is beyond impressive. From the instructions on the light switches to the labelled Tupperware I really cannot think of one thing they could do to improve on the place. The eggs, bacon, bread, wine, olives, dried fruits etc left for us were also as good as you could possibly get. Literally everything about this place was perfect. I could not recommend staying here more highly. We hope to be back as soon as possible!"
9714178,224667208,2018-01-03,8053791,Ana,This home is very special. Best location and so stylish. No expense has been spared in fitting out this home. We loved everything about it. wish we could have stayed longer!
9714178,262450914,2018-05-09,5821789,Steve,Fantastic B&B in the heart of Tanunda. Walking distance to everything and immaculately presented property.
9714178,268744190,2018-05-26,35171808,Glenn,"We stayed for a week in Yvette’s B&B in Tanunda.  We loved every minute of our stay.  The house is perfectly situated in Tanunda to allow ourselves and our friends to walk to all of the towns attractions, returning to warmth and comfort of the B&B when required.  We could not fault the house, the decor or the amenities provided.  We had three couples staying for the week and found there was plenty of room for all to stretch out and relax.  Highly complimented by our guests and highly recommended by us.  A great location to base yourselves for visit to the Barossa. "
9714178,277234860,2018-06-16,39328864,Alex,"Couldn’t rate Yvette and her house more highly. She was very responsive with questions in the lead up, the place was gorgeous, so many lovely touches, delicious breakfast, and perfect for our one year old too - portacots, high chair, and even bath toys at the ready! The location was the perfect distance to the centre of town and also very central to all the wineries and other towns in the Barossa. We had terrible weather all week yet still had a wonderful holiday as we enjoyed our time in the  house so much, on the comfy leather couch in front of the fire! If you go to the Barossa, you should definitely stay here!"
9714178,284664692,2018-07-02,23641510,Melinda,Lovely home. Stylishly decorated. Lots of lovely little extras. 
9714178,294299933,2018-07-22,36677441,Karyn,"Beautiful interiors and everything to make our stay great. FULLY equipped kitchen, nice toiletries, music and Netflix. The beds were warm and comfortable. I could not suggest anything to improve it. The place is truly superb. "
9714178,299881152,2018-08-01,150521152,Susie,"A stylishly presented, thoughtfully stocked and well appointed house a very short stroll into Tanunda which was perfect for dinner. We spent a week here and everything we could possibly want or need was provided. A great base for exploring The Barossa."
9714178,317239831,2018-09-02,14531271,Victoria,"From the moment you enter this property you are met with beautiful and luxurious design and thoughtful hospitality, which makes you feel instantly relaxed and ready to enjoy your time away. The amenities are of extremely high quality with everything being thought about from heated lamps and towel rails in the bathrooms, zoned air conditioning and heating, key pad easy entry on arrival and iPad for music. Quality touches include bathrobes, slippers, hair styling products and toiletries. Yvette has thought about and provided everything that makes this a 5 star property.  You also can't get a better location to discover and explore the Barossa. Thank you Yvette for providing such a beautiful weekend - we would love to come back and will highly recommend your property to our friends."
9714178,320020542,2018-09-08,26126689,Liz,"I have just returned home from a wonderful stay at Tanunda. Yvette's airbnb is gorgeous. Not only is the house divine, but Yvette has stocked the house with everything that you could possibly need. There were lots of little touches here and there throughout the house that made our stay extra special. I can not recommend this gorgeous property more highly. Thanks for a wonderful stay."
9714178,361141491,2018-12-22,42423716,Paul,"Yvette and here home were wonderful!!!

We very much enjoyed Yvette’s caring attitude, hospitality, responsiveness and special touches in the house with items in the fridge and a lovely bottle of wine. The place was lovely - very clean and very convenient. Would love to come back and would highly recommend to others."
9714178,365946257,2019-01-02,61965321,Dean,The only place to stay in Tanunda! Perfect location and a beautiful home.
9714178,409804157,2019-02-08,17903140,Michael,Excellent high quality accommodation very generously fitted out. Very comfortable beds and sofa plus ample equipment for short or long stays. The ducted air-conditioning throughout was a real boon in some extremely warm weather. The only reai negative is whilst it is situated within walking distance of shops and restaurants it fronts on to a busy main road that light sleepers may find traffic noise can be intrusive.
9714178,505119188,2019-08-09,106774239,Geoff,"Perfection! The house is stunning and exceeded every expectation. Luxury, comfort and every convenience. Yvette was an A+ host. Perfect communication and so many thoughtful tailored touches in the house. A wine and platter ready as we arrived and everything we needed for a full cooked breakfast in the fridge. Can not recommend this place enough. Can not wait to visit again."
9714178,533686153,2019-09-22,23015428,Chara,"This is one of the most amazing Airbnbs I have ever stayed at, it was stocked full of delicious food, the bathroom amenities were better than a hotel, and the location was fantastic - direct access to the Tanunda town and a very close drive to all the main Barossa wineries! Highly recommended"
9714178,562563895,2019-11-11,298960399,Nanccy,Yvettes place is the most beautiful cottage with high end finishes and every amenity you could wish for down to umbrellas and picnic baskets. Highly recommended. Location is also fantastic. Only 100m to the local shops.
9714178,584307161,2019-12-29,234838915,Christiana,"Incredible, luxurious property, with beautiful bedrooms and bathrooms, and smart home features. Enjoy lounging outside with a BBQ and cooling down in the spacious living room."
9714178,618213491,2020-03-14,14915082,Nicola,Yvette’s place was absolutely perfect. Everything was thoughtfully presented and of high quality. The house itself was quiet and spacious and we were not left wanting for anything airing our stay. Yvette was lovely to communicate with was an exemplary host. We would highly recommend staying there.
9714178,645450484,2020-08-02,38872839,Daniel,"We couldn’t be happier with our stay here! Yvette was fantastic to deal  with, everything was impeccably clean and the house itself was everything that we were seeking for our weekend away. 
The location is great, only a short walk from Tanunda’s main attractions and very central to the amazing Barossa wineries. 
You get what you pay for and I’d love to book it again sometime in the near future  "
9714178,663502102,2020-09-13,17672269,Lynda,"Yvette’s house is absolutely perfect. Quality, luxurious fittings and furnishings such as super comfy beds and couch, double rain showers in both bathrooms and fluffy towels. The location is amazing, a couple of minutes walk to all the essential amenities and great restaurants. What really made it next level was all the thoughtful and welcoming touches such as local produce inc. smoky bacon, cheese, snacks and wine, a huge variety of Nespresso pods plus fresh coffee beans, hair straighteners and lovely toiletries in each bathroom, robes, slippers and a variety of pillow types in each bedroom, umbrellas, Netflix and beautiful throw rugs. There is nothing we wanted for and it made an impeccable base for our girls weekend away. Thanks so much for an amazing stay Yvette!"
9714178,724104338,2021-01-14,82383204,Rachelle,"The best of both worlds! This was one of our favourite Airbnb’s where you get all the luxuries and amenities of a hotel with all the space, convenience, and comfort of a home! Yvette was quick with communication and our stay was seamless. The location was perfect and we couldn’t ask for more. Thank you so much for everything!"
9850994,57176883,2015-12-22,21719584,Dee,"Jonathan was a superb host, incredibly welcoming & knew lots about the region. I chose Jonathan's place as a base to explore the Barossa Valley wine region, the room was elegantly decorated & the grounds were picture perfect. A hardware store close by hired out bicycles & Jonathan's place was right next to the start of the cycle track. I would recommend that if you stay at Jonathan's place to take advantage of the dining table outside as it is a great spot to enjoy breakfast in the morning, an afternoon tea or to watch the sunset behind the vineyards with a chilled glass of wine in hand. Just a point to add, Jonathan's dogs were really lovely too!"
9850994,58189545,2016-01-01,45082822,Emily,"Jonathan was a fantastic host. He provided clean, spacious, and adequate accommodation in a beautiful home, and was well aware of the surrounding areas, happy to share his knowledge with us. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and wouldn't hesitate to return."
9850994,58479410,2016-01-02,154390,Tanya,Great place to stay... Room was large and just like the photos. Jonathan was extremely welcoming and knowledgeable. We were thankful we could bring our dog. Highly recommend staying here!
9850994,59319796,2016-01-09,8404897,Ina,"Ich habe mich sehr wohl gefühlt in meinem Prinzessinnen-Zimmer. Jonathan ist unkompliziert und herzlich. Ein tolles Haus für einen Besuch im Barossa Valley!

Thx Jonathan, I really enjoyed my stay!"
9850994,59432110,2016-01-10,665386,Frank,Jonathan was a great host. We didn't get to spend a lot of time with him or in the house but his knowledge of the area helped us out a lot discovering little gems in the barossa. Our room was clean and perfect with a big comfy bed that we would love to stay in again. Cheers Jon and thanks again. Frank and Ally
9850994,59595005,2016-01-12,16448034,Frank,"At the end of a long (and hot) drive from Victoria it was a welcome relief to reach Jonathan's home in Angaston and to enjoy his hospitality in this little oasis in the Barossa Valley.  The room was comfortable and well equipped but Jonathan gave us pretty much free rein over the rest of the house, including the lovely gardens and outdoor areas, not to mention the attentions of the lively Baxter.
Unfortunately my wife fell rather ill on the first night of our stay and could not stray far from our room for the next 36 hours, but Jonathan was extremely empathetic and understanding and tried to make sure that she was as comfortable as possible.  His support was very greatly appreciated."
9850994,59662443,2016-01-13,25412423,Emmanuelle,Jonathan was friendly and welcoming host. We had a lot of room to ourselves. The place has a lovely backyard. It's walking distance from the village and near a walking/bike trail. A great place to stay in the Barossa Valley.
10285222,61127044,2016-01-31,40589598,Cameron,"Had a great one night stay in the Ruby suite. This is a one bed apartment attached to others, but is entirely self-contained with private access (including via code which was ideal given our arrival later in the day). Very spacious, with good cooking facilities, and very convenient given location to main street shops and restaurants - we walked to and from dinner out."
10285222,61689890,2016-02-07,27768238,Tess,"Lovely pool area & beautiful old house!
The house is split into 3 or 4 AirBnB accommodations, this one is located at the rear of the house and it is very dark. 
You enter straight into the main room and off this there is a small bathroom and spacious kitchen.
It has been some time since the property was renovated so it's looking a bit tired with water stains on the ceiling and bubbling on the plaster walls due to water damage.
The bed was extremely hard, I actually used the cushions from the lounge to lay ontop of the bed as it was very uncomfortable. 
Loved the pool area but would recommend a Reno & new bed!! "
10285222,74598949,2016-05-16,34935405,Saya,"I don't have a bad word to say about this place! It was brilliant and very Cosey with a lovely kitchen, living space and a fire place as a bonus!
Kym was great and very understanding and friendly despite us having booked this place literally last minute/ same day. She responded promptly and was very patient, and super accommodating.
The fireplace was even set up so all we had to do was put a match on!
The room was in a lovely old stone building with a few original features.
Location was exceptional, right in town, in the lovely tanunda. 
I would definitely stay here again. Hopefully not too many people discover this place! 
Of note, accessing the keys was very efficient and check in was easy. 
Thanks again Kym! "
10285222,116828867,2016-12-03,21799867,Ryan,"A beautiful little apartment, fully equipped for an overnight or week long stay. Great location and great value for money"
10285222,129987442,2017-02-03,34334379,Fishayee,Great location. Nice place to stay after a day of wine tasting! 
10285222,131310472,2017-02-11,31041400,David,"The location is excellent. An old home but quite nice. Would be lovely in winter with the fire or if you had time to use the pool. Biggest downside was the bed, two singles to make a double has a hump in it, but one side is rock hard. Sadly the worst bed I've slept in and I have 130 nights a year away from home. Otherwise it was excellent. "
10285222,198016721,2017-09-28,642178,Kerry,"We were disappointed, the place was dinghy and smelt of smoke.  If you're not a small person you will struggle to get behind the bathroom door to the toilet. The couch is at the end of the bed too close to the TV and you can't watch from bed as the couch is in the way. We found this way over priced and found other much nicer places to stay for much less cost."
10285222,221221894,2017-12-25,77626300,Jamie,"Good location, nice pool and bbq area, nice full kitchen with good quality appliances. Building is run down but only because it's historical. With this expectation in mind it was well worth the money."
10285222,614354024,2020-03-04,42174874,Laura,Great little AirBnb in the heart of Tanunda. Shame the weather wasn’t bright enough to make use of the pool. Very happy with our stay at Kym’s!
10285222,619751989,2020-03-18,188920172,Jackie,"Spotlessly clean and well equipped and easy walking distance to shops, bars and restaurants. An old building so quite dark inside."
10285450,63415264,2016-02-22,57335368,Chelsea,"Memory Lane was a great place to stay at our time in the Barossa Valley.  It was withing walking distance to the main street of Tanunda. The booking process with Kym was very easy and even when I'd forgotten to call to check-in, Kym's team gave me a call and sorted everything out. They were very friendly and made the booking process a breeze."
10285450,73359095,2016-05-08,41321208,Natalie,"Loved this place! I took my mum up to the Barossa for Mother's Day weekend and Memory Lane was the perfect place for our stay, we didn't want to leave! I can't wait to come back during Winter time and make use of the open fireplace. A beautiful home with a lot of character in a great location. It's just like the photos!"
10285450,75428588,2016-05-21,54165858,Natalie,Place was absolutely gorgeous! Thoroughly enjoyed the spa bath too - perfect location for a Barossa visit :)
10285450,77233040,2016-05-30,59080268,Zarina,"The house was very comfortable and cosy. It was clean and tidy. We enjoyed our stay, the house was close to shops and wineries. 
We loved the fire place which came in very handy as it was quite chilly. Would definitely recommend to others. Thank you"
10285450,93341866,2016-08-12,41203137,Kathleen,Memory Lane was as described & pictured. Was a warm & comfortable place to stay after touring the Barossa in winter - the open fire was especially great after a cold day. We were 6 friends travelling & there was ample room for us all. Very handy location to the main street to be able to walk around town. The team was very easy & quick to respond to all messages. We enjoyed our 1 night visit. Would recommend.
10285450,103133910,2016-09-20,93120489,Amica,"Absolutely perfect for what we wanted, great spacious bedrooms, beautiful gardens and Bbq area. Any questions were promptly answered, check in was easy. The open fire was enjoyed with a port in the evening. Easy walk to the Main Street and all good restaurants. Will be returning. Thanks "
10285450,108317361,2016-10-15,69495179,Tamara,"We loved our stay in Memory Lane. The place is very charasmatic with plenty of space for the 4 of us. Sleeps quite a lot of people though so we look forward to another visit with the rest of our family along perhaps. Lovely little outdoor spaces too to relax and enjoy the serenity.  

Walking distance to the main street so great location."
10285450,112277131,2016-11-05,13868505,Chris,"Kym's Memory Lane is the perfect home away from home. As soon as my wife and I entered the front door, it was as if we were returning to our ideal home. The dignified elegance, thoughtful availability of general food items and peaceful tranquility of the location made this our favourite place to stay in the Barossa Valley."
10285450,116834950,2016-12-03,31881946,Kristy,"Highly recommend. This is a lovely house in a great location, only a few minutes walk in to town and a
 short drive to some nice wineries. House was clean and comfortable and check in /out and communication all great. Suitable for families or a romantic couples getaway. "
10285450,122058270,2016-12-20,92413743,Susan,The location of this accommodation was absolutely ideal. The cottage was clean and tidy and we even got a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary!
10285450,124887455,2017-01-02,3488178,Dale & Gaby,"This house is very comfortable and has a lot of charm. It is close to everything but provides a peaceful and quiet retreat. We would recommend to couples or groups wanting a comfortable, well equipped and clean base to explore the beautiful Barossa region. Thank you! "
10285450,126426481,2017-01-11,57072813,Lynne,"The cottage matched up to the photos and the location was good but there was no wifi, I was told it was subject to availability, this had not been told to me when I booked, 2 days prior to arrival. I was told that it was available in cafes but as the time difference in U.K. was  11 hours cafe opening times were not appropriate for contacting my family with wifi which I am reliant upon for communication.
I also presumed that the cottage was privately owned and not part of a tourism business. It did lack the personal touches which I've become accustomed to in the many other Australian airbnbs which we've enjoyed staying at."
10285450,131128819,2017-02-10,26658411,Andrea,Lovely little cottage within walking distance from all Tanunda's shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend!

10285450,134569171,2017-02-27,7272045,Rhiannon,"Great location, close enough to the main road for convenience, but far enough to be nice and quiet. Check-in was easy and the accommodation was comfortable."
10285450,141783835,2017-04-04,54560530,Krystina,Such a fascinating cottage. A history buffs dream. Such a welcoming home and the ability to bring our four legged friend with us was brilliant.

Comfortable lounge and beds, super clean, great homely kitchen, a HUGE relaxing spa bath and to top it all off for us.. dog friendly. We loved being able to stroll down the road for shopping or dinner (with or without the fur-babies) and the door to door service for our Barossa highlights tour,  just perfect! Thanks again for having us: Lisa, Michael, Henry & Charlotte"
10285450,545737507,2019-10-12,47728971,Dan,"Perfect location in the heart of Tanunda, makes exploring on foot or by car very easy. Peaceful location, with a nice outdoor area."

10286738,106231549,2016-10-04,53521434,Tracey,"This property is certainly well located but is also dated and requires renovating & refurbishing. When we arrived we went to sit out back with a glass of wine but the chairs were covered in ants & the plastic ones stacked up were grubby. We moved out front but that's cozy for 4 people and we moved inside due to mosquitos. The mosquitos also sneak inside and managed to keep us awake 2 out of our 3 nights along with the possums and trees brushing against the roof. 
Amenities like basic kitchen supplies were left for us plus a decanter of port which was a nice touch even though we didn't drink it.  The fireplace was nicely stacked for us to turn on but downstairs can get quite cold and the heating goes straight upstairs making the upper rooms almost overwhelmingly hot if you use the downstairs heater.
I don't think we had any direct contact with the owner after the original booking as this property seems to be managed by an agent but have to say the agent was very pleasant and helpful. Full credit to them for being available on a public holiday when we managed to lock ourselves out. They answered the phone promptly, gave us a solution but offered to come out to help if we needed it. 
This property has good bones and with a little cosmetic help has the potential to be an absolute gem."
10286738,108170194,2016-10-14,23086540,Josephine,"We stayed here for 2 nights. It's comfortable, central to the beautiful town of Tanunda, and our hosts were very friendly and accommodating. "

10286738,127385935,2017-01-17,5580834,Carol,"This was a great size house for 6 adults to stay. Easy walking distance to Tanunda's main street with shops, restaurants and cafes. Clean linen, good quality glassware and crockery were appreciated, as was the powerful air conditioning on a couple of very hot days! They accommodated our two dogs as well, which was really helpful and made for a fuss-free family trip. We really enjoyed our stay and would visit again next time we have a Barossa break."
10286738,131290811,2017-02-11,115741176,Stef,"I reccomend ""a secret treasure"" to all those visiting the Barossa. The house was clean, well furnished and positioned in a perfect location! Thank you for contributing to a wonderful weekend away "
10286738,134357520,2017-02-26,53265525,Fiona,"This is a gorgeous cottage-style home with four generous bedrooms and was an absolutely fantastic place to stay! The team at GetawaysSA made everything so easy for us, including when we wanted to add extra guests and by suggesting a winery tour (which was wonderful, thanks again to John!) they also turned the lights on which made the place look so cosy on our arrival and put the key in the key safe when we let them know we would be arriving past check-in time. The house had absolutely everything we needed including a fully equipped kitchen with all utensils & equipment required to make meals when we didn't feel like going out. Also a courtyard & garden which would be great for alfresco dining or a drink or two. The location is so close to the thriving main street, but not too close. We'd love to stay again next time we are in the Barossa.
Only downsides were the door locks which didn't feel all that secure, the creakiness of the old floorboards, a few dead bugs stuck in the windows and a few wear and tear issues with the property. "
10286738,142152380,2017-04-06,32746365,Simon,"Kym's place was perfect for our large group, close to Tanunda town centre, plenty of rooms and great for a BBQ out the back."

Kym and the team even gifted us a bottle of champagne to say congratulations. We were able to check in early and they were always on hand if we had any questions on queries.

Kym organised a wine tour for us which was great which we highly   reccomend. Check-in process wasn't smooth as we didn't receive a pincode for the lock at check in time, and when we did receive it (after calling), it was wrong but they were helpful once we called for help."

10287444,113988315,2016-11-14,89600870,Courtney,"Unfortunately our toilet got blocked twice which may be a reflection of the old plumbing - however, a plumber was sent out as soon as possible. The communication was great!  The shower head isn't the greatest and water got everywhere - there was no TV remote and we were really disappointed to find no wine glasses in the house. Otherwise we had a lovely stay and was right in town with great accessibility. "

Easy check in and check out. 
On the slightly pricier side but a lovely place to stay"
10287444,207784924,2017-10-29,35350543,Gina,"Beautifully kept house right on the main street in Tanunda. We were a group of friends enjoying the wine regions after a work trip and this house was spectacular to explore. You very much get an historic sense within the home, however everything has been well maintained in the style of the house. Despite traveling in late October we still got to benefit from the fireplace on a chilly evening (quite a novelty for us!) Perfect location for enjoying the town and visiting local wineries."
10287444,216039329,2017-12-03,142106649,Nick,Clean and comfortable. Easy access to Tanunda township. Would recommend this accommodation.
10287444,216443961,2017-12-03,23018009,Philippa,This house is well located for visiting the Barossa. Unfortunately it smelt like previous guests had been smoking in the house.

"
10298152,80844036,2016-06-20,73704992,Stephen,Although the host wasn't there to welcome us it was easy to to get the keys and make ourselves at home. Central location for restaurants and easy driving access to the local vineyards. Great place to stay. 
10298152,85453940,2016-07-11,2767122,Sandy,"I didn't get to meet Kym, however her staff were really helpful and friendly. The position of the cottage is perfect, step out onto the street. No traffic after 10pm, it was really quiet. Plenty of heating, neat, tidy and clean. Off street parking, perfect for my workplace away from home with heaps of power points and spacious dining table. Loved the local truffle, thank you, the biscuits with a cup of tea making me feel right at home. Tanunda is a picture perfect and hospitable town. Thanks Kym and co. I'll be back."
10298152,102671498,2016-09-18,88181554,Kelly,"Central, clean, well equipped and quaint maisonette in Tanunda. Comfortable beds. Sweet addition to leave a dog toy and bowl (but we brought our own and would have preferred a bottle of Barossa wine ;) Large bathroom with spa bath (although some decent shampoo and conditioner would have been a nice touch). Good communications with the staffwho manage SA Getaways. Just felt it was rather overpriced compared to equivalent accommodation we have stayed in. Thought the additional charges for children under 10 years and for the dog (refundable deposit would be more fair) and for the wifi made it expensive and not great value for money."
10298152,133985706,2017-02-25,9374776,Lindsay & Tim,"Barossa Best is a nice cottage on the main street through Tanunda. Easy walking distance to shops etc. We had a great one night stay exploring the Barossa; the house was spotless, spacious, with private parking out the back. Dog friendly is a big plus, big enclosed area outside for the dog to enjoy. Would stay there again ! "
10298152,140592649,2017-03-30,113447923,Ben,Central location in Tanunda. Nice old style home. Our hosts also ran a private wine tour which was great and recommended.

10298152,294261294,2018-07-22,201687463,Amy,Served our purpose wonderfully. Great location to eateries and shops in Tanunda. Amenities were clean and the touches of hospitality really made it an easy and enjoyable experience. Spacious rooms. Would stay again if coming back to experience wineries of Barossa. 
10298152,309827285,2018-08-19,37633976,Deanne,"Great find, cosy and welcoming, excellent location in town."
10298152,335324879,2018-10-12,208785382,Katrina,This is a delightful cottage that is perfectly located in the main street of Tanunda. It is an easy walking distance to great eating options and other amenities and has a great coffee shop right across the road. The booking process was easy and Kym made us feel welcome from the get go. The cottage is clean and comfortable. For winter it is easy to heat. The bedrooms are huge and the beds comfy and spacious. My only regret is that I didn't make time to use the spa bath in that great big bathroom -maybe next time. There's just so much to see and do in and around the Barossa and this was a perfect base.
10298152,405953016,2019-01-28,47291939,Kelly,"Kym’s communication, information and check in details were great. The indoor spaces were clean and perfect for 2 couples, and the location was within easy walking distance to shops and eateries. Outdoors could do with a good clean and also a tidy up (removal of old and seemingly unused outdoor furniture and plant pots in bad condition). 
NB this spot shares a front gate and front garden with another BnB immediately next door, and the back outdoor areas are adjacent. So, if you’re after complete privacy ‘Barossa Best’ might not be for you. 
If you’re not fussed by overhearing each other’s conversations and don’t mind sharing the front area then go for it!"
10298152,445271910,2019-04-29,165664375,Clive,"Tanunda is a wonderful place to visit.
Secret Garden is central and easy to walk to the best eateries in town.
Car park under cover off the street at the back was great.
Handy having the wine tour operator next door."
10298152,548168962,2019-10-17,2390743,Catherine,"Listing did not advise that there was an additional $25 pet surcharge, and I did not receive any communication about this until well after the 48hr cancellation window had elapsed. Was left with no other choice but to pay this fee or lose my full booking cost. Shame though as this is otherwise in a good location."
10298152,579989693,2019-12-21,7249671,Tracey,"This place is a perfect gem with plenty of character if you want to stay in Tanunda!

The central location meant an easy walk to shops and restaurants. we requested prior to arrival that beds be split and this was done with no fuss at all. The beds were comfortable, the décor was simple and stylish. We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Thank you so much Kym for allowing us to stay at your property. We will be back."

Will definitely use again!"

10348508,187935738,2017-08-28,33951032,Margaret,"Perfectly situated right in the heart of the main street. We could walk to the pub for dinner, cafes for brekky and then head off exploring easily. But, in side the house, you wouldn't know you're right on the main street. Couldn't even hear the traffic at all! Would stay here again."
10411844,64795648,2016-03-08,34803814,Laura,"We had a wonderful time at Shalamar at Tanunda. Although we did not see Linda or Kate, communication via email was welcoming and prompt.  The spacious, homely accommodation was exactly as described and photographed.  We enjoyed the little complimentary touches – chocolates, milk, spring water, filtered coffee, tea. With disabled friendly seating in the shower/bathroom and no stairs throughout, made travelling and carrying luggage with elderly parents so much easier. Arriving outside of business hours did not pose a problem collecting the house keys. The ducted airconditioning was a welcome relief from the heatwave. Bedding was firm but comfortable with a range of pillows to choose from. The location in a quiet street, close to a great bakery, was the perfect base for wine tasting in the Barossa. I would highly recommend for a family or group of friends. We would love to visit again!"
10411844,67433657,2016-03-29,5147283,Jessica,"My mom and I had a very nice stay at Shalamar at Tanunda. The house had everything we needed and the back yard area was a great place to sit and unwind with a glass of beautiful wine from the Barossa Valley or the local brewery that was just down the road. The house was located very centrally to the town. Even though we didn't see Linda, she was readily available via email/mobile if we needed anything. It was a great house, for our quite short stay. "
10411844,70997939,2016-04-22,65798197,Carmel,Our stay at the Shalamar was very pleasant. The entire place was clean and very comfortable. Easy to find and close enough to walk to the shops. Will recommend it to friends. Thank you Linda

They also checked that we were able to gain access to the house given the road works on the main route through Tanunda. Good space and definitely retro styling.
10411844,115763468,2016-11-26,93808743,Louise,"Very cute place, great location, felt a bit like staying at grandma's, in a good way.  We had everything we needed (plus complimentary choccies) with the exception of wifi, but that honestly probably added to the serenity.

We were also provided helpful information about road works and closures in the town prior to our arrival. This house has everything you need and is perfectly located for touring the winery region. The air-conditioning was on and the house was cool when we arrived as it was a hot day, which was nice. Oh and there is a fantastic bakery just a few minutes away!"

10411844,164858255,2017-06-29,76429824,Jordan,"Great 3 bedroom home. We were looked after before we even arrived with the heating turned on, on what was a freezing afternoon. Highly recommend."
10411844,166254594,2017-07-03,129780233,Mark,Good value 3 bedroom suburban setting attached duplex.  No complaints but be aware you need taxi to get to restaurants in Tanunda.  Also heating inadequate for Barossa winter.
10411844,167780201,2017-07-08,138654432,Samantha,"Great little house for a small family. Clean, warm and cosy and has everything you need including high chairs and port a cot.

10411844,183316358,2017-08-17,45172013,Janelle,"Linda's place is perfect for a quiet retreat in the Barossa. On this trip, I am travelling with my 85yo mother and Linda's place was perfect. It would also be perfect for a family and 3 couples or a group that would use the 2 double/queen beds(don't know the size) and two single beds. There is a pleasant outdoor area set up well for the cheese and wine prior to dinner. Kitchen a great size and well outfitted for cooking. It's close to town (a significant walk but not unpleasant for the younger generations in good weather). I recommend FermentAsian for dinner - great wine menu. ($20 corkage for byo tho.)"

10411844,212233093,2017-11-17,21501900,Anna Patricia,After travelling for three weeks it was so nice to come to a real home away from home. Comfy and clean. Good size to spread out a bit and very close to everything we wanted. The road was so quiet and with full black out curtains we overslept two days in a row. Such a welcome relax. Recommend for couples and families and so reasonably priced too.

The house was as described, clean and ready to go. There was plenty of space that we didn’t need as a couple. The air-conditioner worked acceptionally well! 
It is a nice walk away from coffee shops, restaurants/centre of town or a quick taxi ride. 
The bedding was comfortable and the linen was scrumptious! 
Shower has nice hot water. 
We highly recommend Linda’s place - would stay again if we visit Tanunda again!"

Although we didn’t meet in person, I didn’t feel it was necessary to, as everything was easy to find, and I felt if we had a problem, Linda would have been there promptly to sort things out. The house was very clean and tastefully furnished. The beds had lovely clean linen and were very comfortable.
We arrived cold and exhausted from interstate. We walked into the house to find lights on and a wonderful warm welcome, as Linda had thoughtfully turned the heaters on for us. Such a gesture was so very much appreciated. The house was perfect for our stay, I would definitely stay there again, and certainly recommend it to others."

10411844,415524635,2019-02-23,71407000,Lyn,"The house is exactly as the pictures show. It was clean, spacious, and very comfortable with everything you would need for your stay. Basic pantry supplies, tea & coffee etc were appreciated.
Extremely quiet, but you do need your own transport as is on edge of town, which was not a problem for us. 
Would definitely recommend, good value for the money."

10411844,433671056,2019-04-07,26142038,David,"Good spot for a base. You’ll find lots to do around Tanunda and Linda has left a folder with heaps of information re eating, drinking and sight seeing etc. Would recommend. It was our second stay. Thank you."

10411844,445283427,2019-04-29,157561024,Michelle,"Great location in tanunda. Clean and tidy house, would definitely stay here again."
10411844,448143232,2019-05-05,169794093,Catharina,Well maintained and very clean. A little way out of town which is okay if you are happy to walk. Nice quiet area.

10411844,466090613,2019-06-09,262184568,Nader,Linda was great to deal with even though we didn’t end up staying at the house as our plans got cancelled due to health issues. Excellent communication and I have no doubt based on this that the house would have been immaculate 
10411844,468606549,2019-06-13,6534569,Aaron,Great little base camp for the Barossa
10411844,470112894,2019-06-16,165150768,Lisa,Linda's place is well located in Tanunda. It was very homely and clean and met our needs extremely well.  Communication was easy and Linda was very accommodating with the times we arrived and departed.  Angaston and Nurioopta were a very close drive when exploring the Barossa.
10411844,487215109,2019-07-13,260731700,Rachel,"Great set up, very clean, no dramas at all!"
10411844,507722973,2019-08-11,30135234,Daniel,"Stayed over Linda and Peter’s place for 3 nights for the Barossa Marathon festival. Place is pretty big and clean, and the good thing was that I was the only one staying in the house. Can definitely fit up to 6 people as it has 3 bedrooms. Location wise, it is ok, though you will have to walk quite a bit to the town area if you don’t mind. Highly recommended to drive here if you are staying here as there is no public transport around and taxis can be rather expensive here. Otherwise, it’s a good place to stay in."
10411844,511867370,2019-08-18,137054969,Pauline,Good location for this neat and tidy accommodation.

10411844,541241468,2019-10-05,5313796,Andrea,"This home was oh so comfortable with comfy beds, cuddly blankets, books, playing cards, toiletries - all the little things that can make a holiday relaxing. We loved the quiet, the garden and especially the undercover outdoor eating area (in addition to the indoor dining area). The location is excellent, really easy access to all the places we visited and the odd shops we needed (Foodland nearby open long hours). Oh and FANTASTIC big shower!"
10411844,542989403,2019-10-07,27021407,Federico,"Great location, clean and tidy house and very friendly hosts. Highly recommended!"

10619599,296483132,2018-07-26,46747172,Donna,"Kim's place is in the front and part of a large beautiful home on the main street of Tanunda, residential area.  Lovely garden in the front area. Very handy to shops, cafes & restaurants.  Beautiful high ceilings large rooms very warm & inviting.  Great place to stay & reasonably priced for Barossa.  Good communication & self-check in no problems."
10619599,708608144,2020-11-14,112624675,Lucy,"Place was lovely, great location and customer service. The garden outside the suite makes for a lovely atmosphere, especially in spring. I highly recommend this place for a short stay."
10634089,62443048,2016-02-14,1692419,Joy,"We ended up not meeting Kym because we were driving around the Barossa Valley, but we were able to check in via telephone. The process was easy and we used a code to get into our room. The suite is located in an old house which is divided up into 4 separate units. Bed was comfy, and the ac worked well. We could easily walk up to the main street and found several cafes open for breakfast and had reserved for dinner at the 1918 Bistro. Tanunda is a very charming town, and I wish could have stayed longer. 

The swimming pool was nice, just a bit chilly when we stayed."
10634089,91804921,2016-08-06,86802733,Mark,The booking process was fine however the room was quite tired with a hotch potch of furniture provided and lacked any appreciable decor or theme. It had a lovely wood fire and an old inefficient  split system Air Con that couldn't keep the chill out of the room. Unfortunately the toilet was broken so in the end we decided not to stay the night. The room would probably be fine for most people but at over $200 a night there are probably better options around.  
10634089,100712094,2016-09-10,24780127,Jess,A cute place with charm and beautiful fireplace. The location was superb. Thank you. 
10634089,127919106,2017-01-21,25516646,Claire,"Excellent hospitality! Comfortable bed and situated in  great part of the area, we will be back."
10634089,142566113,2017-04-08,62572916,Wayne,"Comfortable and quiet suite, close to everything that Tanunda has to offer "
10634089,207804139,2017-10-30,2369659,Karina,"The room is quaint and well decorated. It has a full fridge and there are wine and champagne glasses available. It got a little noisy if other guests were sitting at their outdoor area, which is near the entrance to the room. Not having wifi for foreign travelers was a bit hard to stay connected and look up wineries to visit."
10947532,62635790,2016-02-15,2343373,Elise,"Super friendly, warm and helpful hosts who went out of their way to make our stay special. The property was even more beautiful than in the pictures and has some lovely surprises you don't get to see in the pics. The room has a leafy private courtyard and easy access to the lovely saltwater pool. Excellent breakfast provisions including gorgeous home made jams and marmalades and real milk with cream on the top. Great location for visiting wineries and restaurants. We couldn't have been happier with out choice, it's great value for the quality of the accommodation. "
10947532,63422447,2016-02-22,58434041,Anna,"The Stables proved to be the highlight of our (much too) short weekend stay in the Barossa Valley. The super talented hosts were exceptionally welcoming and delightful to chat with. The accommodation itself is a beautiful stone cottage with views of the gorgeous gardens which have been fertilised with hours of love. The personal-touches in each corner of the room have been perfectly balanced with the history contained in the walls and the modern-day amenities. Location-wise, it was ideal for visiting many wineries and restaurants. When we return to this beautiful region we will definitely be staying at The Stables again but for a much longer period, so we can explore all the hidden gems it has to offer."
10947532,64372522,2016-03-03,34805496,Gail,"Set within the Vineyards of the Barossa Valley this delightful retreat had everything.  Newly converted, the accommodation was comfortable and the hosts very friendly.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Stables and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mixing it with evening drinks on the riverside deck and enjoying the company of Tibbs the oh so friendly dog.
"
10947532,64864446,2016-03-08,12312790,Phil,We really enjoyed our weekend getaway to The Stables.  The accommodation was perfect and we really appreciated the pool in the hot weather.  The hosts have the right balance between welcoming you and making sure everything is OK  but also allowing you some privacy to relax.  The setup of the building really works well.  We also enjoyed the many sculptures around the property and then meeting the artist was great too.  What a perfect place to explore the Barossa from.
10947532,66998639,2016-03-26,30128798,Stephen,"Just off the main road between Lyndoch and Tanunda is this sweet little farm and generous host. Really enjoyed the space, the garden, the pool and the company of Tibs the dog. Probably suits early risers as there occasional truck noises, rooster crowing and other country sounds. Kay is a real sweetie. "
10947532,67463580,2016-03-29,7389816,Georgia,The stables was the perfect place to start our Barossa adventure. The gorgeous stone cottage had all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. It was extremely clean and tidy and the hosts very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking past the vines to the wonderful riverside deck. The Barossa bike trail also runs past the back of the property which was great to walk along. We couldn’t have been happier with our choice. 
10947532,67646532,2016-03-30,25324655,Kellen,Wonderful visit. A tranquil setting in the middle of wine country. Lovely hosts!
10947532,68492173,2016-04-05,2839836,Hannah,"Kay was an excellent host, offering lots of assistance but also giving us privacy. The cottage was beautiful and just what we were after. The property was also great, with a beautiful deck to sit and read or have a glass of wine. The dogs were also a highlight. "
10947532,68541201,2016-04-05,28326804,Bernadette,"This place is beautiful! Kay made us feel very welcome and the little cottage was very clean and tastefully decorated. Very comfy bed and gorgeous bath! This place is in a great location for wine tasting, restaurants and golf! "
10947532,69709667,2016-04-12,60299042,Jessica,"From the moment we arrived at the Stables, Kay and Madeleine made us feel so welcome. The property is absolutely beautiful with lovely gardens, a vineyard, and quirky sculptures dotted throughout. 
Excellent attention to detail, with so many thoughtful touches: fresh flowers from the garden, bath salts, plenty of extra towels and linens on hand, and fresh local grapes to snack on.
We slept very well in the quiet of the countryside and the bed and bedding were very comfortable.

The best part about the property were the hosts though. Warm and friendly, they were always happy for a chat but gave us complete privacy as well. 

As far as the area goes, we felt very centrally located in the Barossa and had easy access to the bike path and the various towns.
The location in the countryside can't be beat! Close enough to town to pop in for dinner but tranquil and relaxing for downtime.

We'd definitely stay here again.
"
10947532,71259704,2016-04-24,42881435,David,"We both had a wonderful time staying at The Stables.   Our hosts were welcoming and the accommodation was wonderful, cosy, clean and well appointed.  It was just right for our romantic weekend away.  We loved the location and enjoyed everything our hosts provided.  The description of the accommodation was accurate and we were not left wanting anything.  Thank you to our hosts for such a great time."
10947532,71856007,2016-04-29,28167255,Tiffany,"Our stay at the Stables was a highlight of our trip to South Australia. The cottage is charming and well-equipped, surrounded by lovely gardens and vinyards. Great Barossa wineries and restaurants are a short drive away. Breakfast fixings were all delicious: homemade jam, apples off the tree, eggs fresh from the 'chooks'! Kay and Madeleine were wonderful hosts, offering advice for touring the area and making sure we had everything needed for a comfortable stay. "
10947532,72722784,2016-05-04,5728990,Sebastian,"Kay was a wonderful host and had great knowledge of the local wineries and most importantly, good coffee! The stables were a beautiful conversion and we had a wonderful time staying - can't wait to go back."
10947532,73310118,2016-05-08,29531092,Sarah,"We had a great weekend away at the Stables. Lovely, welcoming and personable hosts. The B&B was comfortable, clean and tidy, with a homely feel and lots of spots to sit and relax on the property. It is also in an ideal location. Highly recommended and would definitely come back. "
10947532,74457637,2016-05-15,45398521,Amanda,"We couldn't have been made to feel more welcome when we arrived late at night after a long drive in the rain! The stables is a beautiful place to stay, located perfectly near Tanuda but not in the bustle of town. The accommodation is everything and more that is shown on the website- I can't recommend staying here enough! We even were able to pick apples and pears from the trees just outside our room! "
10947532,75675388,2016-05-22,59992297,Philip,"We really enjoyed our stay, the cottage is very comfortable and Kay is helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a stroll along the bike/foot path to Jacobs Creek visitor centre, and wine and cheese by the river, with a fresh contribution from Kay's fruit trees! Would definitely return for a longer stay."
10947532,76141223,2016-05-25,36570331,Peter,"What a gem. Lovely accommodation in a 3 acre productive site with vines, chooks and their own produce. If you were looking for an organic place this would be hard to beat. Situated right on the Barossa cycle path but out of town it gave us the sort of access and freedom we wanted. Great bed by the way. Thanks Kay and Madelaine, great to meet you."
10947532,76823560,2016-05-29,10936810,Esther,"We had such a lovely stay at the Stables. Kay and her partner are lovely and very friendly. The place is spacious, clean and has a beautiful garden out the back. Would highly recommend this place and would love to go back and visit again. Perfect location for wine tasting in the Barossa."
10947532,78397768,2016-06-06,10138988,R,"Thank you Kay for a wonderful stay. Perfectly located as a base for touring the Barossa, was a gorgeous weekend and we both really appreciated your hospitality and tips! View to your amazing garden and beautiful bird life from the breakfast nook was a highlight. "
10947532,79384558,2016-06-12,14661535,Vladimir,"Excellent location and awesome hosts.
If you want to experience true Barossa, this is the place to stay.
It's beautiful property located right on bike path and very close to wineries, few towns.
We are looking  forward to coming back."
10947532,80877867,2016-06-20,57988440,Madeleine,"Such a unique space. Lovely hosts. Gorgeous gardens, animals and river nearby. Couldn't have asked for more! Will definitely be back. "
10947532,82206192,2016-06-26,15002635,Daniel,"Kay and Madeleine welcomed us warmly (with a hug!) and showed us around the beautiful stables. The accommodation is spacious and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Their friendly dogs are a bonus! Big bath, comfy bed and even some CDs to set a relaxing mood. The brekky stuff was appreciated, as was the fruit and chocolates. A gorgeous spot, lovely hosts and magnificent surroundings. "
10947532,83490807,2016-07-03,17583101,Patrick & Ava,"The ideal Barossa experience! Kay's place has everything one could think of: beautiful decor, ideal situation, and comfortable living. The space is also thoroughly clean and in great taste, her hobby-farm has all the quaint fittings associated with the area, and to top it off, she is hands-down an excellent host! Highly recommended for all times of the year!  "
10947532,83868127,2016-07-04,24382073,Hazel,"Kay made us feel welcome on arrival and was on hand to help us with directions over the weekend. The Stables were immaculate and Kay provided a well stocked fridge with lovely fresh eggs. 
Perfect location for travelling to wineries of the Barrossa."
10947532,89625144,2016-07-29,1945966,Jessie Carol,"Kay was a lovely host and very welcoming & informative. My sister & i really enjoyed chatting with Kay & her partner and especially cuddles with little Minty the baby lamb :-) The property with the gardens & many sculptures is very picturesque, even in winter & the short walk to the creek & deck overlooking the running creek was a surprise. The property was easy to locate & well situated to explore the Barossa by car. We would definitely stay again if back in the area!"
10947532,92260232,2016-08-08,76690448,Sophie,"We can not recommend the Stables enough! Kay was lovely,  and gave us a warm welcome when we arrived.  She was enthusiastic and very helpful in suggesting things to see and do in the area.  The accommodation was absolutely gorgeous,  like your own slice of Barossa heaven.  It was private and cosy for our winter stay and for summer stays there is a big swimming pool. Rowland Flat is very well situated right by some amazing wineries and close to Tanunda town.  The bike path also goes right past their property! We loved our stay and will definitely be returning. "
10947532,96192238,2016-08-22,6709478,Ellie,"Kay's B&B was perfect for our getaway to the Barossa. You feel like you're out in the country but only a 5 minute drive from the main strip in Tanunda. The studio is very homely, the bed is comfortable and Kay kindly supplied us with the basics - milk, juice, bread, choccies and port. She is also a local and gives fantastic suggestions for places to visit and local knowledge. We loved our stay in the Barossa. "
10947532,98247707,2016-08-30,32321775,Thomas,"Kay was amazing. We may as well have been meeting a relative or family friend who could not have tried harder to make our stay a special one. The spot is incredibly iconic, to walk through her little farm with its metalwork sculptures and rustic outdoor setting looking over a river was an experience in itself. This was coupled with a very cute little private house and a bath supplied with lavender salts and a kitchen with freshly laid eggs! Everyone in the town knows Kay and she was able to point us in all the right directions. Kay, you will be receiving all of our visiting family members who come your way!"
10947532,98949161,2016-09-02,86979292,Coralie,"Staying at Rowland Flat was a pleasant experience for us. The compact and beautifully designed space is private and very comfortable. Kay is a gracious host who made sure we were well looked after. The property is full of beautiful gardens and bountiful chooks, whose lovely eggs were in a basket in the fridge when we arrived. The kitchen is new and nicely done. The old brass bed is not only gorgeous but ver very comfortable. All in all a very good Airbnb experience. Thanks Kay! from Coralie and Peter McKinn"
10947532,100152329,2016-09-07,31828608,Matt,Lovely place and surroundings
10947532,101212144,2016-09-12,26093291,Karen,"We loved staying at the stables. The exquisite garden was about to burst into spring colour with the backdrop of vineyards, along with a few sheep and chooks. Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking on the bike track through the vineyards which was easy to get to at the back of the property. It was also a very central but quiet location for visiting local cafes and wineries and generally imbibing the joys of the Barossa."
10947532,101318423,2016-09-12,23001142,Cara,"Kay and Madeline were exceptional hosts at their beautiful converted stables in the Barossa. The accommodation was just stunning, well set up with everything you need for your stay. The property has vines, gardens, a pool, a deck overlooking the river, sculptures, animals and more! A great location, close to everything, yet far enough away to feel rural. The highlight for me was the hospitality from the ladies... Thankyou for the conversation and the laughs! Will be back again next year!!"
10947532,102120932,2016-09-16,58965714,Peter,"Kay is a welcoming and engaging host. Stables is a quaint, rustic well-appointed cottage set in a serene garden with Kay's own Shiraz and Grenache vines within close proximity to the Barossa wineries. It would have been easy to stay extra days and get to know Kay better as she is vibrant and obliging host."
10947532,102963060,2016-09-19,1480130,Sarah,"Kay made us feel very welcome. She is an excellent host. The Stables is a beautiful, quiet place to stay. Every little detail has been thought of. Comfortable & super clean. Lovely touches like free range eggs, home made jam & port. We can't wait to plan our next trip to the Barossa to stay at Kay's place. "
10947532,104259874,2016-09-25,27832520,Emily,"Kay was fantastic!!! we loved every minute at the stables!!!! Kay supplied eggs, fresh bread, milk and juice for our stay along with some  yummy choccies and port! We loved waking up to the beautiful gardens in the morning! Kay helped us with choosing wineries to visit during our stay and was a pleasure to be around! The property is fantastic and close to everything! We will make sure we stay with Kay again on our next visit to the beautiful Barossa!"
10947532,105441169,2016-10-01,46533776,ChrisandWilf,Great place in fact perfect for us. Close to vineyards and everything you expect in this area. Caring hostess.
10947532,107254761,2016-10-09,9711288,Susan,"Kay was such an amazing host! I was visiting the region with a group of friends (who were staying at the Novotel), and she was really accommodating with the time of arrival (late afternoon, after some wines!). The place was very clean and tidy. It had everything I needed, including some delicious eggs from her chooks! The whole place is beautifully done."
10947532,108697012,2016-10-16,25331424,Judith,"The Stables are a charming and beautiful BNB. The hosts are very friendly and helpful and our stay was made extremely pleasant by their interaction and manner. The rooms are exactly as described and very homely and comfortable. Spring had certainly sprung in the surrounding gardens full of lavender, roses, rosemary and fruit trees. Rowland Flat is very close as is Tanunda, both charming towns full of stone cottages and interesting shops, restaurants and cafes. The Stables is conveniently located in the Barossa Valley and is close to many famous wineries. We drove from Adelaide through Lyndoch to Rowland Flat which I would recommend to others. This journey is through the Adelaide Hills and although slower than the motorway far more picturesque. "

The property was as described a very cute cottage! It was spotlessly clean and it felt like a home away from home. Breakfast was supplied with muesli and free range eggs from the chickens! It is an ideal location for exploring the Barossa and surrounds and Kay and Madeline made us feel very welcome! We will be recommending this property to friends and family when traveling in the Barossa area! Thanks for our lovely stay!

They take great pride in their gardens and the hard work has certainly paid off - wow! The property is even better than described and cleanliness absolutely exceptional. Breakfast was supplied, with eggs coming from their very own free-range chickens. The location couldn't have been more perfect for exploring the Barossa and we will certainly be coming back to stay; we have never felt more at home at someone else's place and never before welcomed with such love! Thank you Kay and Madeline!

I would definitely stay with Kay again when next in the Barossa"

Also very close to Lyndoch, which is a small town with restaurants and cafes. The property itself was beautiful, it was like a quaint English cottage. The house has everything you could need, with eggs and milk provided in the fridge and your own private outdoor seating area. It was truly idyllic. And Kay was a fantastic host! She was very welcoming and accomodating. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"

Kay showed us to our accommodation and settled us in and made us feel at home right away. There aren't enough superlatives to describe how gorgeous the accommodation and property were. The cottage was stocked with everything we could have asked for, and the free range eggs from Kay's chickens were about the best we've ever had. We cannot recommend this property enough and we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else the next time we visit the Barossa!"
10947532,116085274,2016-11-27,12524624,Renee,"We had the best time staying at The Stables, from the first smiley greeting from Kay to the last hug when we left.

10947532,125436913,2017-01-05,50583286,Sarah,"I would highly recommend Kay's place. Every inch of the house oozes comfort, style, and rustic farm-style charm. Although I planned to spend time in the gorgeous claw-foot bath, I found myself too busy enjoying the pool which was a welcome relief from the summer heat. The most gorgeous little hand-made stools offer a lovely view of a beautifully tended and well-thought out garden. Kay left eggs from her hens in the fridge for us so we were fully equipped for a little breakfast. She was gracious and old wordly enough to even leave out some complimentary port! We were thoroughly comfortable there and Kay was a bit of a delight to meet and chat with. The grape vines are literally just over the fence offering a beautiful outlook and there is also a little stream nearby to soak up the sunset at a portable set of table and chairs. I can't rave about it enough. Just go. Stay a while. Barossa a lot. "

Perfect for that romantic weekend away!! "
10947532,142600889,2017-04-08,90214812,Nigel,"I stayed with Kay in the days leading up to my wedding and my wedding night. Kay and her partner were fantastic, caring and helpful - even helping to fix my father's boutonniere, which had the rose head fall off while we were getting ready on my wedding day.

It was the little touches too, like a congratulatory note on the chalkboard, a bottle of bubbles and an awesome bath bomb for our wedding night."

From the scented garden, free ranging chickens to the warm hilarious hostesses with the mostess. We had such a chilled food frenzied long weekend in the Barossa and couldn't think of a more gorgeous place to stay. The Stables are straight out of a country style editorial. Perfectly refurbished with all the right touches. Highlights were eating fresh eggs for brekky, taking a soak in the  claw foot bath, and binging on books on the verandah. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed in your slice of paradise Kaye and Madeline XX"

The bed was fantastic, the bathroom deluxe and the serenity was second to none. There were fresh eggs and coffee in the morning, topped off by a peaceful wine on the deck, at night. We loved watching the Kelpies and Polly the horse roam free, amongst Kay and Madeleine's home grown vines. 

The location was perfectly placed between Lyndoch and Tanunda, allowing for a short drive to many wineries - there are even a few that are in walking distance!
We felt extremely safe and secure whilst staying here and would absolutely visit again. 

Thanks to Kay and Madeleine for a relaxing and refreshing long weekend! They're truly welcoming humans with a knack for running a BnB."

Gorgeous quaint cottage, picture windows filled with sunlight, beautifully furnished with personality and stunning surrounds. Kay really has nailed the set up, thinking about all the little needs and delights that guests hope to find and provided a lovely brekkie with self-contained kitchenette to cook it up in! Highly recommend walking past the vineyard, past the horse and chooks, up to their deck which overlooks the river. If you are a light sleeper you may hear the odd vehicle on the nearby road during the night, although nothing to put us off coming back. Thanks very much for having us Kay and your hospitality.

Kay and Madeleine were such wonderful hosts - warm, welcoming, and so hospitable. They were very willing to offer suggestions and recommendations for out-of-towners. The Stables is in a great location - at the start of a nice stretch to Tanunda with more than a handful of wineries on the way. We definitely recommend borrowing the bikes - the bike path is beautiful (slightly challenging for a wine lover but definitely worth it for the view - and the wineries along the way!). The Stables was the epitome of country charm - it was lovely to wake up with a view into the private gardens, enjoy a long hot soak in the claw foot bath, and partake in a leisurely breakfast of local produce including home-made preserves and fresh eggs! We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this AirBnB and hope to visit again soon. "

We got there late but they were around with the electric blanket and heater on:) There was coffee, muesli eggs and bread in the fridge for breakfast and a carafe of Barossa port to ease us into it.

This is a great location if you have an event at the Novotel as it's walking distance. Kay hires out bikes and you can easily ride or drive to Tanunda and a whole bunch of great restaurants and wineries. 

We had a great stay, highly recommended."

Chooks, a horse and beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) truly a fairytale. The bed is super comfy and the home is equipped with everything you'll need, not to mention a deep claw foot tub with homemade bath salts and candles. The place backs up onto a sprawling vineyard and a short walk takes you to a verandah overhanging a beautiful river below. It's a little paradise. Kay is absolutely fabulous and even left us fresh eggs and bread and port. We had a lovely stay and are dreaming of returning one day."

Its the little things that make The Stables special - the provisions left in the fridge, home made bath salts, the ironed bed linen (AMAZING!), cosy decor, gardens and surrounding views, the list could easily go on! We can't wait to return, perhaps in the summer when the pool is in action."

Between the fruit trees, vines, dogs, horses and chickens - what a fun experience. And the stable cottage was beautiful with small touches everywhere - including apple juice, chocolates and a tasty dessert liqueur. I rented a bike and hopped on the convenient bike trail (literally along their property) and easily toured the local wineries and road into town for some food.  After a long day of riding, I came home and took a bath in their amazing clawfoot bathtub with some provided bath salts. What a great place. Highly, highly recommend!"

Kay is definitely the nicest person in the Barossa (or maybe even Australia). From gorgeous homemade jams, fresh happy chicken eggs, homemade bath salts, and the list goes on, you won’t find anywhere better to stay in the Barossa.

The cottage is surrounded by a beautiful garden, and beyond that vineyards and forest.  Whether sitting out under the verandah at the back of the cottage, or sitting at the kitchen bench top looking out the window, the views and general ambience are superb.  The cottage itself was well laid out, and very clean, and Kay's attention to detail and thoughtful touches - eggs from her own chickens and local milk in the fridge, ground coffee and quality muesli in the cupboard, chocolates and port - made for a thoroughly enjoyable stay from start to finish.  We cooked dinner each night on the BBQ at the back of the cottage, and also particularly enjoyed walking along the cycle/walking path that runs along the back of Kay's property, alongside a creek with wild olive trees and then on through the vineyards to Jacob's Creek and St Hugo's.  Highly recommended."

The port, fresh eggs, bread and juices were lovely. Kay and Maddy were very welcoming and always keen to give us local advice. We decided to use public transport and the hire bikes which was a great way to get around, with the property backing on to the bike and walking path that links up to Tanunda and beyond. The space with a lovely wrought iron bed, big free-standing bathtub with legs and a breakfast spot overlooking the garden is the perfect opportunity for a very relaxing holiday.

10947532,340433439,2018-10-24,101309242,Andrew,Our stay at Kay’s stables was just wonderful. The property is a beautiful and charming country cottage fitted out to perfection and set in the most beautiful vineyard alongside a creek which is overlooked from a secluded deck on the property.

We did a great early morning walk (30-40 mins) through her paddock onto a bike / hiking trail that heads to Jacob's Creek winery that gave us some beautiful vistas over the vines. We had to cut our stay short due to family circumstances and Kay was very understanding. She gave us a list of villages to stop in on our way back to Adelaide, travelling through the Adelaide Hills which we thoroughly enjoyed."

The hosts are amazing, very Barossa wise & have a lovely garden surrounding this beautifully restored cottage.

Kay provides a gorgeous supply of breakfast ingredients, all local or home made. the tranquillity of their home is food for the soul. Loved the deck area overlooking the creek too. The property is very close to enough wineries to fill at least a weekend, Jacob's Creek, Rockfords and Lou Miranda were our favourites. We cycled to the wineries as the property is very close to the bike track, which was quite challenging but worth it. One of the best airbnb properties we have stayed in and we have stayed in many, all over the world."

Great to have a private pool to yourself and the deck is a picturesque spot for evening drinks. The bed is firm if this is your thing and the cottage is very nicely styled and clean. We loved the friendly dogs and chickens! The hosts were great at giving local tips of where to go and what to see throughout our stay."

Set amongst the vineyards and tucked away in a quiet spot just outside of Tanunda, but within a stone's throw of Australia's best wineries.  Chooks on site providing fresh eggs each morning.  A beautiful deck over the creek frontage.  Immaculate gardens.  Swimming pool.  A gorgeous cottage.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Kay and Mads were the best hosts we have encountered, providing wonderful tips about local restaurants and sites.   We felt like we were staying with old friends.   This property is the gateway to everything the Barossa has to offer.   Book!  It will far exceed your expectations"

Perfectly positioned just out of Tanunda, it’s a cute little place with chickens, dogs, a swimming pool (which was great when 40C), a veggie garden and deck overlooking the river. The place itself is super cute with everything you need, including eggs from the resident chickens for breakfast. Would stay again :)"

The accommodation was spotlessly clean and well appointed with amenities. The personal touches (like homemade jam and fresh eggs from the henhouse in the fridge) were an unexpected touch. The rural setting and farm property were a refreshing—and relaxing— change of pace after several days spent in city hotels. If not for the 14-hour plane flight, we'd be regular guests. Thank you, Kay, for such a wonderful stay!"

Kay is an absolutely delightful host. She is exceptionally welcoming and helpful and passionate about her property. Her creative talent is evident both inside and out. The accommodation is spotlessly clean, full of character and has many homely touches.
For any intending to cycle, the property is situated within very easy access to the cycle path. We cycled the whole length of the Barossa Cycle Trail and this area is on a very picturesque section of it.
Highly recommended."

10947532,713576273,2020-12-05,217144213,Andrew,"You must try this place!  A sparkling clean and well appointed character cottage, yet rustic and cosy. Gorgeous countryside surrounds with a beautiful private garden, surprise swimming pool, and a two minute walk to your own private deck high up overlooking the scenic creek (great for private nibbles and local wine in the evening as the sun goes down). 
Kay was a fabulous host, welcoming and friendly but not intrusive - and there are some lovely treats provided.  Our only disappointment ... we didn't stay longer. We'll be back!!"

10971607,84393090,2016-07-07,73686754,Anna,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the Angaston Masonic Lodge !
Firstly we were welcomed by a cosy fire, a surprise platter and a bottle of wine . Then a spacious apartment that was both very comfortable and clean. We were really appreciative of off street parking being on the main strip of Angaston.
The Masonic Lodge was a perfect central location for the Barossa wineries and HOSPITABLE eateries as well.
We found Robyn to be a thoughtful host that is clearly passionate about creating an appealing , homely and relaxing ""bnb"". We look forward to returning to Angaston Masonic Lodge again !
Anna and Friends."

10971607,115130553,2016-11-21,91763584,Natalie,"I am so excited to write this review. We had the most wonderful experience staying in Angaston at The Masonic Lodge - and it was all because of our host Robyn. 
This was my first holiday travelling with Bub, 8 months old, and we were flying so I was pretty nervous.
When I told Robyn we were travelling with a baby, she went well above what I ever expected.
Robyn organised a high chair, change mat, helped me organise a portacot, made me feel confident there was a supermarket / chemist  across the road that had everything I needed. Which was perfect we were flying.
We arrived to a smiling face and a welcome pack of nibbles, cheese and wine - aircon was on and the lodge just felt like a home.
We stayed for 5 nights and I just didn't want to leave! The bed was so unbelievably comfy! 
It just kept shocking me of all the things Robyn thought of, from supplying absolutely everything we needed (shampoo/conditioner, body wash and I mean top quality products), to a little medical kit of panadol and bandaids!
As we were new to the area, I texted Robyn throughout our stay and she assisted with our every request.
The lodge had such a glorious heritage feeling and the styling just made me feel like I had stepped back in time, from the original piano (I think over 100 years old!) to the high ceiling (I mean very very high!)
I informed Robyn we wanted to have a BBQ so she set up an outdoor area with an umbrella with all utensils, oils etc.
I would highly recommend in staying here, we will definitely be back :)
Thank you Robyn for your incredible hospitality. Angaston is an incredible little town and The Masonic Lodge is right where you need to be."
10971607,207297252,2017-10-29,130525649,Peter,"The check in procedure, facilities and service was super!!

Only minutes drive from the best wineries in the region, this place makes a perfect base for a short holiday.
The hosts' responsiveness was also perfect, with communications prior and during our stay. In fact, during our stay the responses to our emails were almost immediate.
A 5 star experience all around."

We certainly appreciated the welcoming bottle of wine they left for us!

The house itself is contemporary in style with all the convenience of new modern appliances. There is a washer and dryer in the huge laundry room for longer stays.  More than enough room to accommodate our large family event with 3 queen bedrooms and one room with a bunk bed and trundle. Individualized heating for different zones of the house was nice as well. Very comfortable, clean and spacious. 

The location is perfect for getting to wineries and activities inThe Barossa. We are extremely happy we found such a wonderful house. 

Our only suggestions would be the following:  in communications just prior to arrival it would be nice to have been given the house number. That or put a sign on the house saying 'Little House in the Barossa'. 

Secondly. For the amount if money we spent per night, we feel that there should be wifi included in the price particularly in todays connected world. 

Overall we rate this 5 stars and really loved our stay. Thank you John and Bianca "
11380095,106051261,2016-10-03,58400395,Emma,A fantastic little home in the heart of the Barossa. We had a group of 9 girls and there was plenty of room without feeling like we were constantly on top of one another. Everything was very clean and tidy and comfortable for our long weekend stay. John and Bianca were very friendly and accommodating prior to arrival and I would definitely recommend this place to others.
11380095,111580416,2016-10-31,45260233,Simon,Bianca was very helpful. Had a great stay!
11380095,113433507,2016-11-12,93380048,Kori,"Great place in a safe and quiet location. The house is spacious and has an open plan kitchen/dining/lounge area that makes entertaining easy. The house was very clean, had nice range of kitchen appliances/crockery etc and featured contemporary decor throughout. 

I really appreciated the prompt communication from the hosts. They happily provided a range of suggestions of places to eat whilst visiting the Barossa-and their suggestions did not disappoint! Thanks again Bianca & John. "
11380095,123151685,2016-12-27,1608096,Frances,"The good:
*Great sized house for a family
*Excellent location
*Full kitchen with excellent facilities 
*Beautifully presented

What could be improved
* Pest control a few too many spiders
* Make the outdoor area more inviting.  The bbq was really dirty and we could not use it. 
* Supply garbage bags and dish washing liquid as the ppl who would hire this house would more than likely use the kitchen. 

Overall a great, comfortable home in the heart of the Barossa that is well suited to a family."
11380095,146845519,2017-04-23,61058490,Lisa,Had a great stay. Great communication with owners with great information about the area. Clean and comfortable. Would recommend others to stay during their time trying out the beautiful winery's in the Barrossa area.

11380095,202355534,2017-10-11,84389648,Maresa,"John and Bianca's home is centrally located to the Barossa's best and offers all modern amenities in a well appointed, clean and comfortable family environment. We loved our locally baked vegemite scrolls and our children loved the games room. We were not home much due to exploring the region but did miss free wifi. A dishwasher, washing machine, Weber Bbq lessened the cooking and cleaning load and with a well equipped kitchen cooking your meals at home saved us a few dollars (although we spent it all on wine). Gracious hosts with great communication and ease of check in and out made our week enjoyable...."

11380095,249838273,2018-04-03,14946936,Phuong,"Great space - bigger than in the photos. The bedrooms are spacious, there are 2 living areas which meant we could all spread out. Getting keys and checking out was a breeze. It's very modern with great facilities, but it is a 30 minute walk into the main strip of shops in Nuriootpa. Would definitely stay here again!"

11380095,320498950,2018-09-09,99845447,Norma,This is a great place to stay if you are touring the Barossa and need somewhere comfortable to lay your head and have breakfast. It is in a new housing estate so perhaps lacks some of the atmosphere of the area but  makes up for that in comfort and cleanliness
11380095,333111493,2018-10-07,85815048,Michael,Great accommodation and location.

Probably not in the best spot for easy access to shops/restaurants etc, we had to drive everywhere which was fine in the end- apart from that it was a great little base for us to explore the Barossa"

Highly recommend and we will return."
11428035,135193004,2017-03-03,36849227,Nat,"Great, centrally located house. Really lovely feel. "
11428035,142581591,2017-04-08,5675025,Lisa,The house is in a great location. It's very quiet but only a short walk to the centre of town. It has a lot of lovely period features and a wonderful eating area out the back of the house under grape vines. The only problem was that the back bedroom bed is only a twin and it is uncomfortable. 
11428035,169015350,2017-07-11,20840344,Corinna,"We had a lovely stay in this beautiful house. So close to the main street, but quiet and peaceful. The kitchen was well equiped and there was plenty of wood for the open fire (the central heating was great too, but it Winter getaway and all). Thanks."
11428035,171178260,2017-07-17,98856934,Nikita,"This house is gorgeous and roomy. There is a great large working fireplace in the lounge room which we took great advantage of and there is a pretty cool cellar underground in the kitchen which ties in so perfectly with the fact that you have tons of fantastic wineries at your doorstep. Unfortunately the beds weren't partically comfortable or long enough (I'm 5'10). Overall, great value for money, good spot for a family or a friend's weekend away!"

Michael"
11428035,586529691,2020-01-02,52049675,Calin,"This is a great place, right in the heart of Tanunda! You are within a short walking distance of several great coffee shops and restaurants, that would satisfy even the most demanding tastes. At the same time, you are less than 10 min driving from most Barossa wineries, and some of them are actually within a short walking or biking distance. I couldn't have asked for a better place as a base camp for all our Barossa valley explorations!"
11428035,711535404,2020-11-27,53652453,Andrew,Great location and very close to the centre of town...

11857399,105748216,2016-10-02,3820999,Alex,"Robyn was very welcoming, and provided delicious snacks, drinks and food for breakfast, which made our stay wonderful. The bedrooms were cosy and warm, and the main room was huge, with pool table, music and fire (but it was a bit smoky from opening the fire door). The location is easy to find and walking distance to many places in Angaston, and easy to access the rest of the Barossa with car or taxi."
11857399,111029579,2016-10-29,29668692,Andy,Robyn was great to communicate with in the lead up to staying at the Angaston Masonic Lodge. This is a unique building and a comfortable place to stay in the heart of the Barossa.
11857399,112362263,2016-11-05,18946061,Tarnia,"The Masonic Lodge at Angaston was by far my best Air BnB experience yet. With a location as beautiful as this, you would expect a high quality stay, but Robyn truly went above and beyond to make our weekend spectacular. She made recommendations of what to do and where to go, and all the restaurants are within easy walking distance. 
So many little touches made such a big difference to our stay, from the picnic that she organised for us to take on our bike ride around the Barossa, to  stacking the fireplace, providing candles and a bath bomb for the spa, and supplying a beautiful fresh breakfast. You could not find better than this! 10/10"
11857399,117101110,2016-12-04,29670708,Neil,"We booked the Masonic Lodge for a road cycling holiday base in the Barossa and it turned out to be perfect for our needs.  Robyn's communication was truly excellent and responsive.  The lodge was spacious, clean and had a real uniqueness to it.  We were welcomed by a well stocked fridge and a bottle of very good local Shiraz.  The local town of Angaston is quiet, but has good selection of restaurants and shops nearby.  The coffee from Blonds next door was excellent too.  We honestly could not have asked for much more out of this lovely place."
11857399,123812128,2016-12-30,29961153,Alex,This place is amazing! Great little spot in the Barossa. Right in the center of Angaston and easy driving distance to all the great wineries. Robyn was a lovely host. If your looking for a historic stay in the Barossa - this is it! 
11857399,136650240,2017-03-11,116899997,Duy,"Robyn went the extra mile (literally, she drove many extra country miles) to ensure my friends and I made the most of our short stay in the Barossa. From the initial engagement, to itinerary suggestions, locally-sourced food and beverage provisions, and personalised transport, we could not fault the spot-on service or the spacious setup. Would definitely recommend and return for a unique stay."
11857399,144942316,2017-04-16,16460983,Melinda,"Robyn is a wonderful host and the lodge is a great space to stay in. Beautifully decorated and very large we felt very welcome and comfortable. Especially appreciated was the thoughtful yummy supplies that were left for us, after travelling for a while it was so nice to not have to go out for a meal.  Thank you :) "
11857399,146405071,2017-04-22,119545157,Emily,Fantastic location & so much charm!
11857399,159391646,2017-06-11,125295909,Margot,"This B and B is the best of many we have stayed in prior. The building was fascinating history, immaculately presented  and a pleasure to return home to after rambling through the beautiful countryside, classics Barossa towns and amazing wineries. Breakfast  and cheese provisions were very generous however with so many great eateries within a short walk we indulged in the local eateries often. Heating was great and furnished with stylish comfort in every room. . Robyn was very helpful in our planning and offered to drive and collect us to our restaurant for dinner just out of town,  I highly recommend this accomodation in beautiful Angaston. . "
11857399,170591856,2017-07-16,47433622,Chelsea,"What an airbnb to stay at! Everything you need! Robyn was very easy to deal with! She showed us around the lodge. Included was fruit, breakfast and different chesses (thanks Robyn!) Everything you need was here! There was a wood heater that was very toasty! The bedrooms had heating and electric blankets. A pool table. And even make up wipes and hair spray! Very central to everythinf yoy need as well. Would recommend this airbnb to anyone and would stay here again! "
11857399,175847157,2017-07-30,47291939,Kelly,Robyn was an excellent host and the lodge was perfect for our weekend in the barossa. Being mid-winter and with huge spaces to heat we were very pleasantly surprised at how effective the combustion heater was. The beds were comfy and breakfast provisions were phenomenal! 
11857399,181517833,2017-08-13,37025046,Joe,"Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Robyn was incredibly helpful, quick to respond to questions, and gave us amazing suggestions for things to see/do/taste in the region.

The building and amenities were absolutely stunning. The provided wine, cheese, and breakfast ingredients were wonderful. The wood fire was roaring before our arrival and the rooms were more than comfortable.

We lounged, played pool, had a game of chess, ate, drank, and relaxed, all in the utmost comfort. The region is stunning but the Angaston Masonic Lodge is even better. Our only regret that we didn't stay longer. Could not recommend this highly enough."
11857399,182124558,2017-08-14,109368227,Michelle,"Gorgeous weekend, accommodation was perfect and the extra special touches of detail by Robyn were first class. Thank you Robyn we will certainly be back."

The food was fresh, amazing and plentiful. Thanks Robyn for all your - everything that you could think of was there and the food stocks thoughtfulness I would not hesitate to recommend the Masonic Lodge and look forward to returning again soon."

Highly recommend the walk to Thorn-clark winery 
Robyn is a wonderful host and we highly recommend her fantastic Masonic Lodge with welcoming fireplace"
11857399,196691322,2017-09-24,41576718,Zita,"Robyn's place at Angaston is amazing! My husband and I traveled with another couple, and we all had a very comfortable stay in this beautiful converted hall. The luxurious, warm bedrooms are at the front of the property, near the main street, but there was no real traffic noise. The back lounge room is truely enormous, and we loved sitting around the fireplace chatting and laughing after playing some very bad pool games on the pool table. Although we didn't get to meet Robyn, her communication was great; she had many suggestions for things to do in the Barossa region. We really appreciated her ideas and also the delicious breakfast supplies provided. This property is walking distance to cafes, shops and other places to eat. Thanks Robyn!"
11857399,200041430,2017-10-04,40366315,Jane,"We stayed for 10 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Robyn is a great host, very responsive and really wants to make sure you have a good stay.

The place is huge.  Really comfortable.  The water pressure was great for showers.  Robyn and Andrew provide plenty of firewood every day.  When Robyn mentions about providing breakfast provisions... she provides a lot of provisions.  Couldn't ask for more.  She tries to cover all bases - cereal, fruit, yoghurt, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, herbs, halumi, cheese, bread, crumpets... a lot.  Very generous.

there's other nice touches, such as face wipes, hair spray, shaving foam, anything that Robyn can think to provide she does. 

The place is old, it creaks in odd places but it is a historical building.  The beds were very comfortable.

We would definitely stay again."

Everything was special, the place, the location and most of all the hosts. It was a 360° all around amazing experience! The building itself and all the beautiful little touches and interior designs, close to absolute perfection. 
They showed us some amazing wineries and even sent the scarf back that I had forgotten.
We absolutely loved it. If you plan to stay in a central place in the Barossa, this is it :)"

Plentiful local produce for breakfast as well as pre dinner cheeses and after dinner chocolates and fresh fruit. Robyn thought of everything. The abundant fresh flowers were a nice touch and it was great to arrive to the fire already warming the enormous living area. We just wish we had booked for a couple of extra nights.
11857399,269117239,2018-05-27,82048906,Kathryn,"The unique property in Anguston was a beautiful place to spend a weekend away in the Barossa.

11857399,294278795,2018-07-22,34486144,Emma,Staying at Robyn’s house which is tucked into a sleepy town in the Barossa was lovely. She was incredibly helpful with local knowledge and provided a great list of things to do. The house is an interesting historical hall converted into a lovely home. Robyn provided all the comforts we needed for a night and more! 
11857399,301252058,2018-08-04,9637935,Drew,great location with lots of special touches from local wine and cheeses to an awesome breakfast selection. the log fireplace was already on and made the place a wonderful place to relax at the end of a long day.

11857399,333108988,2018-10-06,95830688,Dane,"If you are planning on going up to the Barossa then do yourself a favour and stay at the Angaston Masonic lodge. Great location, beautiful hosts with everything one could ask for."

11857399,343515393,2018-10-31,10953070,Jen,"This fabulous space, once Angaston's masonic hall built in 1912, was a great respite for us - 2 older couples on a road trip through South Australia!. None of us were on a romantic getaway so the spa and the sheep skin rug  in front of the fire didn't entice us. But the quality linen on the brass beads did beckon us all to a good nights rest after a good hot shower and white fluffy bath towels.. We opted to stay at home and cook that night so shopped in Angaston for local product which was almost unnecessary because the Welcome package was the best I've ever encountered anywhere ever. Our hostess Robyn left us wanting for absolutely nothing. Her attention to detail was beyond the pail. Our  airbnb experience here was the best.."
11857399,344571535,2018-11-04,23437354,Katherine,"This accommodation far exceeded my expectations. The Masonic Lodge was very clean, had fastastic facilities and was in a very convinient location."

It's a unique styled accommodation beautifully presented. Robyn goes out of her way to make your stay enjoyable. A generous amount of locally produced food and wine was left for us to enjoy.

Would recommend to anyone wanting to set up a base for touring the Barossa."
11857399,352165493,2018-11-24,224267326,Joanne,"Robyn is a fantastic host. The breakfast ingredients were of the highest standard, local Barossa bacon, eggs, tomatoes, avocado, asparagus and spinach. Cheeses, salami, biscuits, nuts, wine none of which I was expecting. Robyn also took us for our lunch reservation and picked us up. She was very helpful. We loved the place, the pool table and the fire. Great location in a beautiful town. Would definitely recommend."
11857399,354450413,2018-12-01,41811556,Mandi,"Fabulous place to stay in the Barossa, easy reach of local attractions. Robyn & Andrew were awesome hosts, made our stay very enjoyable & easy. Would highly recommend."

11857399,418774674,2019-03-03,150769137,David,Great communication from Robyn from booking to check-in. Robyn provided us with tips on the local restaurants and offered to prepare to accommodate for our toddler with portacot and high chair. The accommodation itself was amazing and beyond our expectations. We thoroughly enjoyed our night and the amenities provided. The local produce for breakfast was delicious. Would highly recommend. We ourselves intend to rerun for the winter experience.

11857399,433626522,2019-04-07,26893297,Heather,"Robyn’s place is outstanding. Amazing place with super high ceilings. 2 rooms with extra comfortable beds. There is plenty of space and then some and is set up well for whatever you desire- sitting on the couch, listening to music or even getting on the mic for a song. 

We didn’t give ourselves enough time to enjoy the breakfast provisions but were impressed at all the food that had been left for us. 

Great location right on the Main Street on Angaston. We will definitively come back again."
11857399,440494033,2019-04-21,166506364,Maxine,"Robyn was our perfect host. The ‘lodge’ is centrally located in the town of Angaston. We were charmed by its history and character, so many little touches were included. We loved a game of pool with a glass of Barossa red at the end of each day. The kitchen is small but we coped. We had a lovely stay."
11857399,441482575,2019-04-22,4648960,Sarojini,Beautiful heritage place very centrally located. The house was warm and clean and to add on there was spa which we thoroughly enjoyed. Robyn had also arranged tour to the wineries and had packed us nice lunch. Very friendly host recommend to all

A magestic building with all the mod cons set in a town steeped in history I thoroughly recommend this experience! For us it was the perfect stay with great hosts! Thank you Andrew and Robyn!"
11857399,500923827,2019-08-03,187203746,Wiktor,"What an amazing weekend we had at Robyn’s place! From the crackling fire that was ready for us when we arrived to the bottle of wine on the table welcoming us to the beautiful Barossa region, everything was just perfect. There’s something really special about coming home to such a beautifully preserved historic building and sitting in front of the fire.  There was great local produce stocked in the fridge for breakfast and wine-touring snacks which we certainly tucked in to! But, if you’re after a more active weekend than we had, Robyn was full of suggestions. Cannot recommend this place enough!  
Many thanks again - love Caitlin, Wiktor and Wolfgang!!"
11857399,554759169,2019-10-27,58708136,Michael,"Throughly recommend staying here should you travel to the Barossa. Convenient and with ample character, the Masonic Lodge feels like a home away from home. Robyn could not have made us feel more welcome and went to great lengths to accomodate our infant son."
11857399,561686046,2019-11-09,130895416,Sean,"Fantastic place. The space was amazing and breakfast was excellent. The little touches where nice, flowers, preparation, newspapers, cheese platter and wine. Enjoyed the pool table and chess.

11857399,707958717,2020-11-09,47518507,Sarah,"Great spot in the middle of Angaston - straight across the road from food works. We loved the pool table and all the antique furniture, plus the historical explanations as to how the space has been used. We had extensive debates about the potential for haunting!  Also loved the cheeses, wine and fruit plus breakfast stuff. This place has everything you need for a lovely stay in the Barossa"

11915715,84394248,2016-07-07,45124734,Tamara,"The property was absolutely gorgeous ( photo's do not do it justice) green and lush paddocks with plenty of space to walk around or set the kids loose. The home was really warm and inviting, Richard was kind enough to have the fire burning before we arrived. The beds were comfortable with electric blankets. The whole house is tastefully decorated and much bigger than we were expecting. I had a friend down from Sydney to give her the Barossa experience and this was the perfect place to stay after a day of wine tasting. I would highly recommend this Airbnb property, I will be back with the rest of the family!!!"
11915715,90561261,2016-08-01,6034036,Guadalupe,"Amazing adorable idyllic cottage. The photos do not do it justice. We were there on a very cold wet winters day and the cottage was warm, cosy and spotlessly clean. It is the type of place you feel at home immediately. The gardens and isolated location were an absolute bonus- without feeling like you were completely alone. Love, love, love "

11915715,139508919,2017-03-25,72827404,Matt,"The photos don't do this gem justice. If you don't mind staying slightly out of Tanunda, you'll love the setting and charm of this cottage. Relaxing and tasteful, and great AV and food/coffee. If you get time, walk down to the canyon to find kangaroos and birds. Lovely. "
11915715,169832883,2017-07-14,134600775,Yvonne,"The cottage is in a perfect setting.  The private garden was beautiful, as were the charming Toulouse Geese and the lambs  in the farm house grounds outside the cottage garden.    We needed a restful holiday and the  it was a tonic,   peaceful and very beautiful.   The house is generous, with a well equipped kitchen,  big dining room and we  enjoyed the gorgeous fire in the living room each night. The walks are lovely.  You can share a part of the history of the Barossa Valley and enjoy!"
11915715,211708942,2017-11-13,154417869,Kate,Beautiful farm location for staying in the Barossa. Only 20min to any winery. And a relaxing quite place to come back to after a days travel and tastings.

It's in a lovely setting, very quiet and peaceful, occasionally you can hear the baaing of the sheep.  We enjoyed sitting out in the garden.  Richard responded immediately to our messages.  The gas tank was changed within 30 minutes when we ran out of hot water.  We never met Richard, but we enjoyed talking to his parents."
11915715,254720402,2018-04-18,35928721,Grant,"The cottage is perfect for a quiet, secluded escape. You feel like you are a million miles from anywhere, when you are only 10 minutes from town and 20 minutes from all the wineries in the Barossa. The cottage is cosy and well appointed with all the appliances you could imagine. Richard was a great host and the breakfast basket (which was delicious) was a nice touch. Can't recommend staying here enough."

11915715,347139043,2018-11-11,150792705,Astrid,"The perfect location, tucked away on a working farm. It was easy to get into Lyndoch for coffee or shopping. The house is very cosy and you are tempted to stay home with a nice bottle to take in nature and the views. We in particular appreciated the outstanding breakfast produce that was offered - the best bread ever, amazing eggs, jam, milk and butter! A place to return!"
11915715,366625743,2019-01-03,10257531,Jennifer,We had a lovely time at the cottage! Was a great base for exploring the Barossa and the hospitality provided by Richard and family were second to none.

Richard gives a warm welcome and gave us some great local tips along with wonderful bread, farm fresh eggs and jams. Can not recommend it high enough"
11915715,414197892,2019-02-18,28214497,Helen,"If you want peace and tranquillity off the beaten track stay at Riverside Farm cottage where the animals are well cared for and allowed to roam free. 

Lovely views and sunsets, you’ll enjoy seeing and hearing the birds and sheep right outside. Richard was kind enough to show us around the farm, introducing us to his friendly Chickens! You might spot one of the Maremma sheep dogs which guard the chickens or even an owl at dusk. The cottage was very homely and had everything we needed - nice and cool to come back to after a day in the heat. Check out the Barossa farmers market in Angaston - delicious produce! Thanks Richard for having us stay."

Definitely sit under the stars at night.  There's no ambient light, so it's quite the show.

Also, be on the look out for kangaroos.  We saw two hop by during our stay."
11915715,516026886,2019-08-23,28427057,Patrick,"With its high ceilings, rendered walls and terracotta tiled floors, it was easy to imagine oneself in a sprawling Tuscan villa – although the views of lush rolling hills and valleys out each grand window served as a constant and breathtaking reminder that you were indeed in the heart of the Barossa. A truly beautiful house and a postcard worthy location, the Cottage was the ideal base-camp from which to explore the region and sample all it has to offer (a task made easier by Richard’s fantastic tips on local eateries!). From the lambs next to the house, to the welcome basket of local produce, our stay was filled with little touches that helped us relax, decompress, and settle into the Barossa pace of life...a glass of Shiraz near the fire certainly didn’t hurt, either!"
11915715,521386336,2019-09-01,156510144,Greg & Anne,"The Cottage is a fantastic place to stay for a weekend in the Barossa, very stylish and secluded.  We had a very relaxing time there."

The hosts were great communicators and made us feel at home. We went for a couple of walks around the farm, visiting the adorable lambs and admiring the breathtaking views. Thoroughly recommend this place!"
11915715,637974768,2020-07-14,242675580,Jim,A lovely cottage in a truly beautiful farm setting. We loved walking by the creek watching kangaroos and soaring eagles and then returning to sit in the cosy sitting room warmed by the fire.
11915715,643509571,2020-07-28,27129566,Graham,"A perfect spot for a quiet getaway. 
Still close handy to all the Barossa Valley charms.
Perfect"
11915715,645480688,2020-08-02,80319896,Angela,The cottage is lovely and extremely cosy! We had a relaxing weekend on the farm and were very happy with the location and amenities. Our toddler daughter loved all the farm animals and we came back to the city feeling relaxed and rested. I highly recommend Richard’s place!
11915715,671392159,2020-10-04,975794,Sheralee,Great place to relax and get away from city life. Highly recommend
11915715,703468917,2020-10-25,205094623,Will,Enjoyable stay in an incredible part of the world
11915715,706656454,2020-11-04,105958741,Ben,"This is a lovely spacious cottage on a very picturesque property, so close to Lyndoch.  It had all the kitchen facilities we needed and was very comfortable. Seeing the extensive bird life, sheep with their lambs and several kangaroos was a real highlight. Highly recommended!"
12191413,111016699,2016-10-29,23846207,Armand,"We had a lovely time at the Barossa Millhouse.  The description was accurate, kitchen had everything we needed to cook breakfast and the house was comfortable.  Kapunda is a beautiful small town a short drive from the Barossa Valley.  "
12192423,72320767,2016-05-02,23965628,Emma,"Jacqueline and her assistant Judy were really communicative in the lead up to our stay at the barn and this made finding the property and gaining access to it a smooth process. The barn is a stunning, unique space full of  original artwork and gorgeous soft furnishings. We did feel as if we had stepped into the pages of a design magazine! At the same time, however, the barn still felt homely and relaxed. Many of the original features such as the cattle trough and exposed brickwork remain. We were welcomed with a selection of provisions including milk, bread and other sweet treats. Kapunda was an excellent base for exploring the Barossa and we couldn't recommend staying at the Barn highly enough. Thanks Jacqueline."
12192423,78062893,2016-06-05,6722350,Corinna,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying in the barn. It was a beautiful, cosy, clean and perfect for a large group to enjoy dinner around the big kitchen table or relax in front of the fire. Jacqueline was very welcoming, leaving breakfast provisions and a fire laid. She also dropped in on the first day and shared lots of helpful tips and ideas for things to do locally. I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. "
12192423,80974890,2016-06-20,67871129,Thiru,"Wow is all I can say, what a beautiful place, it was warm cozy yet colourful and artistic! There is not one element of the barn that I would change it was a magical stay and the fact it was only a short drive away from the main areas of the barrossa meant we could enjoy the great wineries and come back out of the  hustle bustle and sit by the fire and enjoy some great reds. The support also from Judy and Nicole was magnificent whenever we had a question they were right there to help out. Thanks guys for a wonderful stay!! I would recommend the barn to anyone!"
12192423,84326880,2016-07-06,15462435,Maria,"The house was absolutely stunning and we loved the garden. For foodies the kitchen was well appointed to enable some home cooking
The art work was beautiful and the place so tranquil- just what we needed. Ideal of you are looking to unwind "
12192423,85226117,2016-07-10,67690556,Christian,"A lovely place to stay with more than adequate resources available and extremely well equipped. It was a very clean house and was great to come back to after a short trip to the Barossa. Food provisions and a laid out fire were very welcoming and made the stay much nicer and more comfortable.  I highly recommend the house to anyone, Jacqueline and her assistant were easy to reach and the entire experience was very comfortable and extremely enjoyable. Thanks for the great stay!"
12192423,92070225,2016-08-07,1173506,Jamie,"A wonderful place. In fact, the photos don't do it justice. Jacqui was incredibly helpful too. Highly recommended."

12192423,102935353,2016-09-19,17490294,Natalia,"Such a beautiful relaxing stay. The barn is truly gorgeous with original art work hanging on the walls and a lovely rustic yet homely feel. Jacqueline was such a treat, messaging us tips and tricks of where to go and eat and telling us to make sure we enjoyed some wine in front of the fire and was always easily contactable. This property is one not to miss and definitely one I'll recommend to others and try come back to myself. "
12192423,103476765,2016-09-22,60701,Jasper,"A lovely and unique converted barn yard a short drive from the main Barossa Valley centre, we had a lovely stay just relaxing in front of the fireplace. Comms with Jacqueline were straightforward and the place was set up well for our arrival. Would highly recommend to others. "

12192423,123153546,2016-12-27,19466125,Lorna,We had an amazing time at the barn- it is absolutely beautiful and a really unique place to stay. Every room is beautifully decorated with plenty of amenities for everything you need! Jacqueline was also great with communication and gave us tips and advice. 
12192423,124026050,2016-12-31,61036063,Karlene,"We had a brilliant stay at Jacquelines gorgeously renovated barn! Would definitely recommend, we plan on heading back! "
12192423,136640622,2017-03-11,23823989,Tyson,"Such a unique and interesting home...very charming and comfortable.  

Bigger than I anticipated, for two of us the barn was huge.  Great property as well.  

It had everything we needed and the owner was very kind enough to include breakfast items and a bottle of wine.  Just a minute from town which was convenient.  

Two things to point out...
1.  If you are (Website hidden by Airbnb) careful.   I walked away with a few lumps on my head from the beams in the upstairs bedroom/hallway.   
2.  We had a few encounters with spiders...a few dead and a few alive.  We are cuty dwellers so this was an adjustment.      

Highly recommend.  "
12192423,146182064,2017-04-21,41026495,Beau,Absolutely gorgeous location and the perfect place to stay for a trip to wine country. House was immaculate and homely - the perfect place to return to for a few after a day of visiting the local wineries. Jacqueline provided some delicious food and also had great recommendations for the region. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Barossa and would have no problems booking again. 
12192423,159869179,2017-06-11,10029038,David,"Jac' place is lovely, bigger than the photos show, and located in a large private garden. Unfortunately after we checked in late afternoon, we found there was no power to any GPO sockets due to a faulty breaker, so a majority of amenities not available. (E.g. loss of included breakfast supplies as fridge not working, unable to store cold drinks & food supplies we brought with us, unable to charge Phones/iPad, limited kitchen e.g no Fridge, Dishwasher, Kettle, Toaster, Microwave, no WiFi or TV, no Washer or Dryer, limited Wood Heating without fan, no Hair Dryer of Iron etc). This made the stay impractical. We were unable to easily resolve the fault after several calls/msgs & trying to reset the breaker ourselves. Unfortunately Jac was overseas and the local contacts provided were unable to assist. We are not claiming any compensation for first night, but have requested refund of second night as we checked out a day early. I should add that Jac was very apologetic, and we realise it was just very bad luck. "
12192423,173187009,2017-07-23,139976096,Kane,Amazing! Loved it
12192423,182541391,2017-08-15,22787557,Leanne,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Barn. It's  an awesome space with plenty of room. The gardens, the fire, the decor all made for a enjoyable short break from the city. Loved it❤️"
12192423,189491844,2017-09-02,48654348,Steve,Beautiful property. Cosy with the fireplace. Super romantic and cute. Everything you want for a weekend away 
12192423,197565646,2017-09-26,24804986,Holly & Alex,"Gorgeous creative home, which is completely private and makes a good base for following the wine trail. Enjoyed our time here and would stay again. Thanks Jacqueline "
12192423,221824697,2017-12-27,43056339,Michael,"Fantastic base for exploring the Barossa, wonderful & helpful host and one of the nicest places we've stayed at so far."
12192423,224682387,2018-01-04,12630128,Brent,"We found it randomly and it was a long way from where we were intending to stay. Once we saw the description of an old barn turned into a much loved & peaceful Home, we had to take a chance and give it a go.
Jacqueline was excellent on email, all was considered so we didn’t go without but it was the unique and comfortable nature of the place that had us falling in love with it.
A glass of the local, non labeled wine at night as the sky goes pink allows you to drift off to the south of France, with only the many pink Galahs to bring you back to a real Australian experience. 
We even read a few chapters of Jacqueline’s book (and later bought a copy) which explained why the place has so much love invested. 
Almost like an adventurous cubbiehouse, we highly recommend it for a lazy time to experience the Barossa. 
For us, it was our first holiday as a young family and the comforts allowed us to sleep on our 3 month old’s times. It made this special time in our lives very unique and well worth looking a little outside the vanilla box. 
Many thanks,
Brent, Saraya and baby Havana"
12192423,253279264,2018-04-14,98512535,Karena,"Charming cottage. A tiny bit out of the ways but we managed with local taxis etc. Loved loved loved the house, styled beautifully, amazingly actually. Perfect touches like fruit, bread, butter etc. Would love to go back!"
12192423,275425191,2018-06-11,10789235,Elizabeth,"Jacqueline's Barn in the Barossa home was a lovely stay location over the June long weekend for our family of 3 (including our 1 year old, thank you for supplying us with a foldout cot!). It is a beautiful renovated barn with all the modern amenities, spacious yet cosy & we were toasty warm despite it being winter  Good location to come home to after being out & about in the Barossa, would definitely recommend to others! "
12192423,296478768,2018-07-26,71045869,Shelley,"Lots of quirky treasures to discover.  Main bedroom well heated by fireplace! Open spaces including spacious bathroom without screens, curtain or glass - just watch the overspray. Fabulous access to the Barossa and surrounds. Thanks Jacqueline!!"
12192423,301851585,2018-08-05,205779479,Angela,"Beautifully renovated and styled. The fire was very warm, downstairs and upstairs. About 20mins away from Barossa Valleh wineries and restaurants."
12192423,309894241,2018-08-19,191314144,Steven,"It was a very modern yet vintage space. Everything was very clean and well organized. It was very spacious and could easily fit 6 people. There was minimal artificial lighting to allow for the sky lights to fill the house with beautiful natural sun light. Although there was a stunning wood fire there was also 3 heaters spread throughout the home for added warmth. All the amenities were sparkling clean and the whole house was beautifully decorated to compliment the style of the home itself. There was a large book of recommendations for food and fun throughout the Barossa on arrival along with fresh eggs, bread, milk, orange juice, water chilled, tea, coffee and spreads amongst many others. It was a stunning space inside and out. It was so hard to say goodbye to and couldn't flaw a thing. "
12192423,339730740,2018-10-22,14957244,Catherine,"This is a lovely and unique place to stay in the Barossa; you'll feel as though you are in the south of France. And the mix of arty and rustic decor is very attractive.  Spacious bedrooms and very comfortable bed.  It's an easy drive to the wineries and eateries in the area, and the town of Kapunda has its own history and charm. Jacqueline provided some great tips for activities you might not discover on  your own as well as info on places to eat."
12192423,365953220,2019-01-02,23754972,Brett,We had a lovely stay here! Location was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone. On our arrival the fridge was nicely stocked with some brekkie goodies which was highly appreciated.
12192423,419436828,2019-03-03,4082566,Tracey,"Beautiful barn, creative touches and restful place. Lovely fresh eggs and supplies for breakfast definitely recommended."

12192423,442594644,2019-04-24,49586874,Madeleine,"Pictures do not do this gorgeous barn justice. Had the most relaxing weekend away, close to the wineries and was great to come back here and have a wine outside and enjoy the garden. Great place!"

12192423,484939809,2019-07-10,9552607,Kim,A lovely stay not too far from the vineyards. Fridge stocked with goodies and loads of fire wood.
12192423,506674041,2019-08-11,13120592,Catherine,"Jacqueline's place is charming. The converted barn is full of character. Jaqueline had stocked the place with snacks, juice, milk, wine etc for our arrival. The weekend was cold with 4 degrees overnight but we were very snug with the heaters and very effective pot belly fire. Check in was smooth and Jaqueline communicated fantastically. The accommodation is the prefect base to discover the Barossa but also a great place to hang out and enjoy dinners in."
12192423,516889079,2019-08-25,276253413,Will,Had a lovely weekend at the barn and would definitely come back when I have the chance. Good location and a great space to enjoy a few glasses of wine.

12192423,598386684,2020-01-27,45350499,Emma,"We had such a wonderful girls weekend away at Jacquelines place.  The barn is absolutely beautiful and would equally be lovely for a romantic couples holiday.  It was very homely and had everything we needed.  Before we arrived, Jacqueline let us know the barn was having some wifi issues, so she left a bottle of rose in the fridge for us.  It was this open communication and personal touches that made the stay that much more special.  Would return without hesitation!"
12192423,628419666,2020-06-08,6071956,Kelly,This place is far grander than the photos. Simply stunning with wonderful hosts and a beautiful garden surrounding.
12192423,637051561,2020-07-12,199880540,Jack,Had a fantastic stay. The barn is exactly what we needed for a get away. Great location to go out and explore the surrounding area. Jacquline was always quick to reply and super helpful.
12192423,639678068,2020-07-19,187368245,Gabrielle,Awesome relaxing place to stay for a quiet getaway. Fireplace is amazing and Jacquelines communication was fantastic. Watch out when using the shower though because the floor will get wet.
12192423,648507165,2020-08-09,5479131,Paula,"A calm, beautiful and cozy home that was just what we needed for a weekend away. Jacqueline was very thoughtful  and helpful especially when it came to local recommendations. We loved the place so much we’ve recommended it to friends and family looking for a getaway from the city. Looking forward to staying there again next time :)"
12192423,652531662,2020-08-17,5393169,Juliet,"A lovely old barn building in Kapunda, near the Barossa, this is a wonderful spot to stay in an interesting old copper mining town. 
Very beautifully appointed, warm and full of paintings and treasures, the house is comfortable and generally well appointed- log fire and bath being my two ‘must haves’ for a lazy weekend away in winter.  The house is very spacious and it also has a gorgeous rambling garden that hints of a much loved history. It would be a wonderful spot for meals in summer I’m sure…
There are most basic provisions available, but If you are planning to cook and eat in (and there’s good reason to stay in and enjoy the cozy old-world charm here) I would suggest bringing a good cooking pot with lid and any special bits you might need for cooking. Some of the plumbing is a bit impractical (no shower curtain in the bathroom with a lovely rain shower over the bath makes showering a very wet event, and the kitchen sink is easy to flood with the tap position), but these are small details that I mention only so you are ready for them!
I would happily return. Thanks Jacqeline!"
12192423,668264442,2020-09-27,209639301,Craig,"Jacquline’s Barn is a beautiful & peaceful space & was perfect for our family of 4 with 2 teenagers. We enjoyed the lovely surroundings, unique furnishings, artwork & the generous breakfast provisions. It is a short drive to the Barossa Valley."
12192423,671395258,2020-10-04,31125053,Neil,"Very nice, would stay again."
12192423,673094635,2020-10-11,45725849,Elgar,"This is an excellent place to stay, I could not more strongly recommend it. Jacqueline has done an incredible job on the place. The garden, living and kitchen areas and welcoming mezzanine bedrooms. We also appreciated her hospitality and extras. Well located with a drive to the wine regions and other towns. Great place, thanks for having us."
12192423,705571961,2020-10-31,4958232,Jennifer,Amazing place! Thoughtful and artistic touches and breakfast provisions. Garden is beautiful and great stable conversion design. Will be back for sure
12192423,718971850,2020-12-27,361532,Sandris,"We had the best time at the barn and beautiful Christmas. What a gem it is and central to everything in Barossa. It is bigger (inside and outside) than showed in the photos - plenty of space for a big family or enough intimacy for a couple.

This was like staying in my Italian country home (which I never had). Jacqueline has made sure this place has everything, including original artwork around the barn. We'll be back!"
12192423,721809674,2021-01-04,9341512,Teeghan,"Jacqueline’s place was lovely, full of personal touches and beautiful artwork. The beds were so comfy! My one caution would be that the lightning is very dark in the bathroom (I’m vision impaired, this was fine during the day but problematic at night) and the stairs are (as expected and noted in the listing) narrow and steep. 
All in all we loved our stay at Jacqueline’s place and would recommend to anyone looking for a base close to the Barossa but away from the crowds of Tanunda."
12192423,722894789,2021-01-08,17131462,Dale,"The architecture of the barn is amazing and we thoroughly enjoyed the garden.  Unfortunately that is where it stops.  

The barn itself was  dirty and needed TLC. For instance the bathroom was dirty with the toilet having pubic hair on the seat and under the seat - It also was unclean to touch, hair in the bath, and tiles.  The bed had hair in it. The kitchen was filthy and needed cleaning. The plates, cups and mugs also needed a clean before use, dust everywhere and a there were a few spiders in the pots and pans.  We also could not close the windows in the roof with birds nesting in there it made for a very echoing and noisy night!"
12856765,77288667,2016-05-31,56238985,Natalie,"We had a great couple of days away at this accommodation. Lots of room for a couple of families, kids had a ball in the big back yard & exploring down the creek.  Spa bath was an added bonus. Robyn was extremely helpful and loved all the little extras too, breakfast was glorious. Thanks for a great stay Robyn & Andrew, would highly recommend and we will be back. "
12856765,79770738,2016-06-14,15991112,Julie,"We stayed here with 2 other couples over the June long weekend & had such a wonderful relaxing time. 
Robyn & Andrew thought of everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. 
The house is very clean,  tidy & spacious. After we cooked dinner in the full sized kitchen and bbq out side, we all sat infront of the fire place in the lounge or played boardgames on the big dining room table. 
It's really close to the main street in Angaston so we could walk down and visit the local shops.
The bed were very comfortable, the hosts are very easy to deal with and the scenery is beautiful & relaxing.
Thanks for a great stay Robyn & Andrew"
12856765,80852510,2016-06-20,74560988,Sarah,Couldn't fault one thing about our stay at winter by the creek! Robyn made our stay so welcoming and enjoyable. We will be back and will highly recommended it to our friends and family. Thankyou once again Robyn 
12856765,81656804,2016-06-24,77215790,Martine,Hosting and responsiveness great. Spa and fire made it. Will be back and highly recommend.
12856765,82110115,2016-06-26,47530036,Bryony,"We had an excellent trip to the barossa. Robyn was there to show us around when we got there. She had provided us with an amazing cheese and wine spread, beautiful breakfast selection and some local biscuits. It was more then we expected. The house was super comfy with enough space for 7 of us. 
The only thing was the smoke detector kept going off with cooking but there is a BBQ outside.
Definitely recommend this place "
12856765,83813711,2016-07-04,10182874,Liz,"Everything about our stay was just perfect. Couldn't recommend more. Robyn & Andrew went above & beyond to make our stay smooth and comfortable. From coming over to help with the fire, to organising a driver, to providing the most wonderful welcome hamper... We fell in love
With the place & hope to come back one day. Thank you!"
12856765,85165507,2016-07-10,74091539,Allison,"Hi Robyn & Andrew, thanks for a lovely stay. We had a great time in Angaston, drinking wine, relaxing and eating yummy cheeses. We were very impressed with the home we stayed in for 5 nights. The wood fire was extremely cosy and the jaccuzi was a pleasant way to end each cold night. Some lovely extra touches were included in the stay and this was much appreciated.  Highly recommended. Thank you :)"
12856765,87307818,2016-07-19,47594948,Andrew,Robyn was very helpful in communicating about our needs for disabled access.  The provisions were excellent and a huge basket of fruit was provided.  There is plenty of wood for the log fire which ran all the time and kept the house warm and cosy in winter.
12856765,90442036,2016-08-01,72076864,Jessica,"Thanks Robyn for such a lovely retreat.  The house was lovely and warm on arrival, fire glowing, and lovely and generous breakfast provisions for both days.  We thoroughly enjoyed our experience and would definitely return again (with or without the kids!)"
12856765,93927226,2016-08-14,54937698,Roger,Robyn was a fantastic and friendly host. Great communicator. Location in Angaston was very convenient. Fresh eggs each day from the chooks were delicious. BBQ was great. Backyard fire pit was great. House was warm with great heating options. Beds and rooms were large and comfortable. House was clean and well presented. TV was excellent and lounge chairs very comfortable. Showers hot and water pressure excellent. Bathrooms will need new tiles fairly soon but no big deal. Highly recommend Robyn's place. 
12856765,97512643,2016-08-27,23688343,Ian,"
Wow! On entry to the property you are taken back by the amazing gardens and warmness of this cosy log cabin. Equally amazing is the kind and friendly host, Robyn, whom goes the “extra mile” for ensuring a comfortable, relaxing, trouble free stay. From being greeted with a food platter with wine to assistance with re-starting the log fire, you truly feel the host has considered your every need. 
I booked this place for my wife’s surprise birthday getaway with our three daughters (aged 6 to 12) for two nights. And Yes, in her eyes, I hit a home run :) The only regret was not booking for longer!  The place itself is centrally located in Angaston and fully equipped to accommodate for all your needs, regardless of age. I highly recommend this listing if you are looking to treat yourself to a peaceful and relaxing escape  in one of South Australia's oldest towns. 
Thank-you Robyn & Andrew for opening up your beautiful home! We had the most amazing experience and look forward to returning in the near future. 
The Saumi’s.

12856765,101037814,2016-09-11,9151210,Cortney,"This place could not be more magical. We had six guests stay and there was so much room and the place was absolutely gorgeous. Think the perfect swiss chalet in the middle of the Barossa. Angaston is the perfect location to access the Barossa, and there were little cafes and restaurants close by for the days we didn't want to leave. Honestly - everything about this place is exceptional. "
12856765,104404294,2016-09-26,33006135,David,Robyn was very understanding and helpful despite last minute changes. The  house was perfect for the weekend.
12856765,106783598,2016-10-08,83021631,Lee-Anne,"Robyn was the perfect host. She welcomed my family into her home with a smile. 
My children loved every moment and had the best time exploring the garden and creek. 
Robyn had games and toys for them play with on rainy days. 
The delicious nibbles and wine for the adults were enjoyed and a lovely touch. 
The fire was warm and welcoming on our arrival. 
Robyn went out of her way to help organise meat trays and birthday cakes, which she kindly offered to collect and was waiting for us when we arrived. 
Robyn also assisted us with directions to her property and helped with information on doctors when our daughter became sick. I can not fault her helpfulness. 
The location was perfect, with just a short walk to shops and playgrounds. 
The house was comfortable and warm and well stocked with everything needed for family life. 
I totally recommend this property to anyone wanting a peaceful break away in the Barossa. 
You couldn't ask for a nicer host. "
12856765,106928620,2016-10-08,13769585,Katerina,"Robyn was lovely, she met us upon arrival, showed us around and got the fire going. Her place is perfection, 4 spacious bedrooms, quiet area and the place has everything you need. Would definitely go back again, Robyn was a great host and provided loads of fresh local great produce. Highly recommended. Thank you for having us! "
12856765,108890554,2016-10-17,36586480,Johanna,"Robyn was an excellent host, couldn't fault her or the house. The house was set up perfectly, breakfast and snacks supplied was full of local, first-rate delicacies. Robyn supplied us with lots of tips on what  to do during our trip that we found very useful. The house itself was perfect for our long weekend visit, hot tub, fluffy towels and plenty of games and dvd's. Our kids were particularly delighted with being able to collect eggs from the chickens each morning! We had an excellent stay, would highly recommend!"
12856765,110032366,2016-10-23,5646940,Sarah,"We had a lovely stay in Angaston at Robyn's house. Warm fire on arrival with cheese platter, wine and fridge stocked with an amazing spread for breakfast. 
Robyn was extremely helpful in giving us ideas of restaurants/ activites.
We will definitely be back!! "
12856765,111011099,2016-10-29,71568250,Robyn,"We had the most enjoyable stay at Angaston by the Winter Creek, we were greeted on Friday afternoon as planned at the property and our stay was faultless.  Robyn was a fabulous host, everything was there for us, we just had to arrive with the attitude of having a great time! We did just that.  The weather was perfect, the spa was utilised and the grassy patch in the garden was a lovely place to spend Saturday afternoon, indulging in local produce we had collected throughout that day.  Breakfast supplies were ample and attention to detail made our stay homely and comfortable.  Thankyou from all of us ""the bookclub""!"
12856765,112365427,2016-11-05,69599236,Hanne,"Robin was a perfect host, she went out of her way to make us feel at home, we loved her cosy house, and it was close to everything we needed, if we are back in Angerston again, we wouldn't hesitate  contact Robin.

12856765,112641272,2016-11-06,90184096,Jacqui,"One word - PERFECT!
We were staying in the Barossa for a wedding so this was the perfect location, walking distance to the main street, shopping  cafe's and restaurants.  Very central for all that you may want to see and do around the Barossa.  
Our host Robyn - one word again - PERFECT, fantastic communication from first contact, very flexible with our booking as we weren't sure on how many were staying with us right up until the last few days but Robyn was very accommodating
Our welcome - warm and homely as soon as we walked in the door, with the wine and cheese on the dining table to  farm fresh local produce breakfast ingredients in the fridge - and that was just the beginning - there was nothing for us to think about, right down to the fluffy white bath robes and slippers!!.. 
Great experience, great house and fantastic to share with friends and family, would highly recommend...and already have :) "
12856765,113915895,2016-11-14,86191745,Freya,"This place was fantastic. Everything was perfectly, cleanly and lovingly presented. 
Robyn has all bases covered, and more, for whatever you could need at this house. 
We would definitely stay here again. "
12856765,114983408,2016-11-21,55515082,Jess,"We could not rate Robyn or her accomodation highly enough. Prompt and friendly communication, Robyn was so helpful with any query we had, both about the house and the surrrounds. Perfect accomodation for a group of people, lovely secluded outdoor area with hot tub, and the most delicious brunch in town thanks to Robyns recommendation! We'll definitely be keeping this accomodation in mind for our next trip to the Barossa. Thankyou!!"
12856765,115766513,2016-11-26,23425133,Renee,"What a relaxing spot! Everything has been thought of, location is a perfect base for exploring the region and Robyn was a wonderful host. All the little touches really make the difference - from fluffy robes to quality toiletries to delicious local produce and treats...thanks Robyn! Made for a fantastic girls weekend away!"
12856765,116591919,2016-12-01,3045869,Pauline,"This is a great place to stay. Beautiful garden, comfy beds, spa bath and more. Great for a group of friends or family.  Robyn is a welcoming and generous host."
12856765,116822012,2016-12-03,4636410,Wendy,"We ( 3 couples)  just spent a lovely week end in the Barossa. 

Angaston by the Winter Creek was a rare find with 4 bedrooms,  3 of which had queen beds and 2 + bathrooms. This in itself is not the norm and is what attracted us to the home as well as its outside area of BBQ, spa and eating area. 

We appreciated Robyn's  effort with the breakfast, nibbles and wine left for us to enjoy and the high quality products for guest's use in bathrooms. 

An enjoyable stay. 
"
12856765,120106249,2016-12-07,41951903,Shayne,Robyn would have to be rated as a fantastic host.  The additional extra touches were greatly appreciated by the whole family.  Robyn greeted us and explained  the house layout and how to use all the facilities.  The cottage was exactly as described and presented immaculately. 
12856765,121771081,2016-12-18,59677313,Sue,"House was quirky, with everything we needed for 5 adults. Local pantry items were tasty. Gardens hard to leave for other destinations. Handy to wineries and good choices for dining. A lovely weekend place."
12856765,122956986,2016-12-26,2530283,Marianne,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay over Christmas. The house was perfect for our needs - plenty of room for 5 adults, close walking distance to angaston's main street, and very effective air conditioning. The lovely back deck and beautifully maintained grounds were a bonus. We were particularly impressed by how well stocked the kitchen was - so many lovely local treats and loads of quality kitchenware and wine glasses. Check in was a breeze and Robyn went out of her way to assist and make us feel welcome (she even put up a delightful little Christmas tree for us!). A great experience all round. "
12856765,123549790,2016-12-29,106191411,Nathan,"This place is peaceful, quiet and tastefully decorated and equipped for a great get-away. Certainly a thoughtful host. "
12856765,124923158,2017-01-03,17539065,Lucy,"This was a perfect retreat for 6 friends for a chilled but fun-filled new years get-away!
Robyn and Andrew were lovely and gave us a tour at check in so we knew all the ins and outs of the property (and spa!) which was a welcoming start to our stay. Robyn even provided some treats and sparklers for our NYE celebrations!
One of the most difficult decisions we faced was choosing our rooms! All are lovely and have their advantages!
The property offers many different areas where you can play sport, suntan, lounge, spa, eat, bbq and in the colder months even sit around a fire pit! Luckily we had three nights to try a bit of everything in the beautiful warm weather.
Even though the property is in the sweet suburbs of Angaston, it feels like a secluded farm retreat. You can walk to the local shops in 5 minutes.
We loved our stay and would love to come back!"
12856765,125269994,2017-01-04,3023184,Lee,"Robyn was a wonderful host, she takes care of every little detail to make sure your stay is perfect. The property and home is very lovely, clean and well equipped. W e especially enjoyed the garden and spa. It's a 10 minute stroll or very short car ride to the shopping strip of Angaston. We would definitely recommend."
12856765,126045871,2017-01-08,46882496,David,"Warm friendly greeting, accurate description, well located and serene location."

We loved staying at this house! It was cosy, private and walking distance to shops and restaurants - a fantastic and beautiful location. Will definitely recommend this house  to friends and family. 
"
12856765,128330072,2017-01-23,3744179,Jeff,"Wonderful place to stay at. 5 stars for sure. Everything we wanted, it had it plus more. Great location from the vineyards, hot tub was awesome, wish we could have stayed longer. We'll be back. Thanks Robyn"
12856765,128986409,2017-01-28,86665949,Lou,"We had a group come to stay for several nights and had a wonderful time at the house.  The spa was amazing and the hosts provided us with lots of outdoor entertainment (backyard cricket, croquet, etc) on the beautiful green grass outside - which was also nice for sitting back and relaxing! We were welcomed with many good surprises - wine, cheese, fresh fruit, breakfast, delicious biscuits, plus more.  It was a very spacious house fitting our group of 3 couples nicely.  Robyn was very accommodating to our needs and was able to help us organise some meat from the local butchers (delicious!) as well as provide us with information regarding transport during our stay.  We would highly recommend!! "
12856765,131615955,2017-02-12,415780,Helen,"This was my best AirBnB experience ever, and I've stayed in homes all over the world. The house was excellent, even better than in the photos, and Robyn was an incredibly thoughtful host- the snacks and treats were a lovely surprise, and one we were very grateful for after a long drive! A lovely area, and the house is a short walk to the the little high street with a couple of cafes, pubs, a wine bar and restaurant, not to mention the excellent cheese shop that is well worth a visit. If I could give six stars I would. "
12856765,133991137,2017-02-25,20921553,Sarah,"This place is amazing. Robyn is so friendly, helpful and fantastic to deal with. The house is big and a great space for entertaining. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
12856765,135890764,2017-03-06,73469652,Daniela,Robyn was so generous and helpful! It was our wedding and the bridal party stayed in the house. Robyn even helped us source beauticians! On arrival the fridge was full and the house was just perfect! Will absolutely recommend this beautiful home to everyone!
12856765,137349647,2017-03-14,98720636,Fay,This property is close to the main street of beautiful Angaston.  It is spacious.  The children enjoyed the spa very much.  The breakfast supplies were amazing.  
12856765,139140965,2017-03-23,114284413,Grant,"Angaston on the Winter Creek is a wonderful, comfortable place to stay, and Robyn is a generous and gracious host. We were struck by how well appointed the house was, and how much was available in the way of housewares, linen and towels, and so on. Also, Robyn was very generous with the breakfast provisions and other pantry items she left. She is going to be a hard act to follow."
12856765,139546239,2017-03-25,30569411,Marika,"We were blown away by the beautiful log-cabin style house and stunning garden and surrounds. Although two streets away from the Main Street in Angaston, the location was very quiet. Angaston was the only interesting town in the Barossa this weekend--all the others closed their shops at 12 noon. The house was roomy and comfortable--with 4 double beds in 4 bedrooms--perfect for groups of friends. There are only two rooms that are next to each other, the others are spaced out around the house. There is a huge 8 person spa with TV and dining table under the private veranda out the back. Inside there is a kitchen w a generous amount of provisions for breakfast and other treats!! There is a Nescafé coffee pod machine and gas stove and all the cooking utensils you could need to cook a dinner party! There is a huge dinner table for 10 and you can relax in the lounge room later with massive TV and dvds. We just loved it there and it was a hit with our guests too. Just book it you'll love it!!"
12856765,142577049,2017-04-08,19542573,Nicole,"Where to begin!! Robyn and Andrew's house is perfect for a group of friends looking to enjoy the Barossa from a beautiful and comfortable base. The house is just a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston and a 20 minute drive to most of the Barossa wineries, but is in a quiet neighbourhood on a large block.

The house is decked out with everything you could possible need. The linens are lovely, it is spotlessly clean and there are plenty of things to do in the house - games, cricket, a spa, sound system and a huge TV (great for footy). There is also an open fire which would be amazing in winter (it was way too hot when we were there).

Robyn really is the hostess with the most! She left the fridge full of delicious Barossa goodies including wine, cheese, eggs, bacon, fresh bread, tim tams, fruit, vegetables and even Maggie Beer icecreams! We had a delightful breakfast in the garden alongside the creek one morning. Robyn also offered to help out wiht transport (which in a wine region is a huge plus).

We will definitely be back. Robyn's place was great value, accurately described and the hospitality was second to none.

Angaston is a great base for the Barossa - it's small and quaint but has everything you need. We ate at the Wine Bar in town which was excellent and visited the farmers market on Saturday morning - amazing. 

Thank you so much Robyn and Andrew! We will see you again. Kind Regards, Nicole, Noel, Josie, Ben, Martine and Dave.
"
12856765,143650537,2017-04-12,116136210,Taryn,"We had a great stay here. Leading up to our holiday, Robyn went above and beyond to provide up with email information about the house and the local area. Check in was easy and Robyn even made the effort to come by and show us around the house and how everything worked (e.g. The awesome spa!). The house had more than enough space for our group, with a large kitchen for cooking as well as huge indoor and outdoor dining tables. Robyn provided loads of local foodie treats, like smoked bacon from the local butcher and wine from a local vineyard. We would definitely return for another holiday."
12856765,144942174,2017-04-16,24207378,Natalie,"Robyn's place is AMAZING. We had two couples stay there but you could easily accomodate another four people / two couples in the house as there's a lot of space both inside and out. Robyn has thought of everything in this place, from a lovely welcome snack, to outside dining and fire pit, games corner, awesome home theatre, even a karaoke machine! There's a great kitchen if you love to cook as it has all the essentials and more. It is the perfect house for a fun relaxing getaway but also close enough to walk into town if you feel like venturing out. We based ourselves there for four days and it was a nice easy drive to a whole range of amazing wineries. The house is perfect, I would highly recommend it, and it's made even better by Robyn's helpfulness and thoughtfulness. We will definitely be back! "
12856765,145956050,2017-04-20,7062663,Deborah,Great house for a family or group of people! Central location for the Barossa and close to the shops in the lovely town of Angaston. Robyn left us little surprises and I would highly recommend this property to anyone!

12856765,148484026,2017-04-30,13844206,Mary,"An absolutely perfect spot to enjoy both the Barossa wineries, but also enjoy the lovely cafes & bistros of Angaston...followed by a dip in the hot tub! A marvellous weekend!"
12856765,149993774,2017-05-06,120676924,Katrina,Thankful for a beautiful stay. Lovely  quiet weekend away with the girls. The spa was great and we loved all the treats. 
12856765,151670233,2017-05-13,72429626,Anthony,"Angaston by Winter Creek is exactly as described. It is super spacious, yet very cosy, especially with the combustion heater. Robyn met us at the house and gave us suggestions about where to go and what to do. The house was very clean and the fridge was stocked with local produce. It is also in the perfect location, just behind the main street of Angaston. We would definitely be back.  Thanks Robyn."
12856765,152518177,2017-05-17,124337940,Yi,"Clean, spacious, warm, cosy, well equipped house with unique structure. Enthusiastic, detailed host. She even prepared special bath gel and sweets for my son! Thanks Robyn, this is one of the best stay I have ever had!"
12856765,155817381,2017-05-28,7044380,Lauren,Robyn's house is wonderful. She really has thought of everything and it was just what we needed for a weekend away. I would recommend this house to my friends and family and would love to stay here again next time I'm visiting the Barossa. 
12856765,157416383,2017-06-03,125494882,Kylie,"Robyn is a terrific hostess and has a gorgeous place! I celebrated my 30th birthday in the Barossa with 6 friends at the beginning of winter and her cabin-style home was perfect. 

-There were local treats left in the fridge, freezer and kitchen in case anyone needs a snack after their journey or before stepping out for groceries/dining locally. 
-The property was adequately heated (it was the beginning of winter) but if you are still cold there were robe options, throw blankets and slippers. 
-The main street is just one block over and is a very short walk. 
-It easily fit 7 people without feeling crowded at all. 
-The grounds are gorgeous and there are outdoor dining options (we had our final breakfast near the hen house on the outside tables in the sun, it was amazing). 
-If anything is on in town or the surrounding towns, Robyn is very considerate and will let you know in case you'd like to add it to your itinerary.
-It sounds silly but I was worried if there'd be enough towels for the spa, but I needn't have! There were plenty of big beach towels for all of us and still plenty of bathroom towels to shower with. 

Thank you for allowing us to have an absolutely wonderful experience in your airBnB home! I cannot recommend it enough!
"
12856765,159860511,2017-06-11,47373117,Wendy,Thank you for allowing us to stay at such a wonderful home. The food and goodies were a pleasant surprise.

12856765,179196294,2017-08-07,117876308,Dåni,"This place is such a beautiful, inviting, warm place to stay we couldn't fault it. Such a lovely earthy feel, with wonderful hosts who just went above an beyond what is needed. Leaving delicious fine cheese platter, lovely breakfasts and such great communication. I would love to live there it is a must for cabin lovers with a beautiful surrounding. Very spacious and comfortable room for families. Thank you and we highly recommend to anyone looking to hire this place go for it! "
12856765,182517012,2017-08-14,38880676,Chiara,"We had 4 couples stay at Robyn's house for 3 nights and we couldn't fault the experience. Robyn made check in very easy and walked us through the house. She stocked the fridge with amazing local produce for us to have breakfast cook ups including fresh eggs from her chooks in the backyard. The house has a lovely outdoor spa and she supplied 8 fluffy robes to make the experience feel even more luxurious. Robyn also supplied body wash, shampoos and all the little necessities in case you forgot to pack! The fire pit in the backyard can be used for $25 extra per night and is well worth it! The house is located a short walk from angaston town and this was a perfect location to access the Barossa wineries each day! Overall an absolutely wonderful stay that I would recommend to anyone!"
12856765,185128107,2017-08-21,118647580,Denise,"Robyn greeted us when we arrived, and provided us with a thorough overview of the houses amenities, and even started a fire for us.  The cottage was the perfect mix of rustic with all the modern conveniences of life, making this place a perfect place to stay while exploring Barossa.  We really enjoyed the home and the surroundings!!"

We visited with a 1 and a 3 year old and they loved the beautiful yard and daily trips to the chook pen. The house is clean, comfortable and well stocked with the essentials including a great selection of cheese, and local produce and a delicious breakfast platter. Robyn has thought of everything and provided clean and safe children's equipment and linen. A great location in the heart of Angaston in easy walking distance to the amenities and restaurants. Look no further, you've found your B'N'B!!"
12856765,209970757,2017-11-06,16224493,Allan,Robyns place was simply fantastic. It was the ideal place to base our group get together in the Barossa Valley. The accomodation is as described in the pictures. All communication with Robyn was easy and she was quick to respond. Check in was simple.  We all agreed that we should return if ever back in the region. Would definately recommend. Allan
12856765,215295590,2017-11-28,52906123,Monique,Robyn went above andbeyond to make our stay enjoyable.  in each room there were small additions and special touches that made us feel at home and allowed us to relax and enjoy our stay.  By far the best Airbnb my family has been to thus far
12856765,216466668,2017-12-04,53669629,Paul,"Robyn certainly went out of her way to accommodate us. Lots of yummy food, a bottle of wine, flowers and nice soaps etc. were appreciated.  An upstairs bathroom would be good, but plenty of room and the spa was nice. Cheers."

Superb hospitality including wine, cheeses and breakfast items. Robyn made sure we had everything we needed for our stay, including accomodating our very young children (e.g: high chair etc).  Her tips for enjoying the area were really helpful too.  Fabulous!"

Also having an Expresso coffee machine was great and saved us searching for that ""elusive great coffee"" in the area.  Robyn also offered to arrange fresh seafood for us for the festive season which was another unexpected gesture.  Would love to visit again in Winter. for that really warm and cozy experience.    Giselle"
12856765,223157955,2017-12-31,39282635,Elizabeth,"Good clean accommodation and excellent breakfast provisions plus extras such as a bottle of wine.  Lovely table setting outside and great lawn area.  Angaston was a bit quiet on New Year's Eve, not that it worried us."

Kindest Regards

12856765,274714530,2018-06-10,3021297,Martin,"Absolutely fabulous, we had 3 generations sharing this wonderful home. Beautiful inside and out,  Robyn welcomed us with a great spread of local produce so no need to do any shopping the night we arrived. The only problem was we werent there long to really settle in and just enjoy the place."
12856765,280706442,2018-06-24,182999905,Genevieve,"This was a lovely place to stay for my friends and my long weekend in the Barossa Valley.  There were lots of nice touches to the property and Robyn was a great host.
My friends and I loved the spa, fireplace and overall ambience of the house and garden."
12856765,298887454,2018-07-30,40362603,Sarah,Robyn was so helpful and the place had everything we needed and more. My kids and husband suffer badly from asthma and this house was spotlessly clean and they had no problems breathing at all! We got the bbq pack and it was absolutely fantastic fresh and tasty food! Everything was easy! We’d definitely stay here again! 
12856765,302672254,2018-08-06,6921124,Richard And Dianne,"We were a group of four ladies spending a long weekend in the Barossa.  We were so pleased we chose Robyn's place to stay.  We each had our own comfortable room with electric blankets, very comfortable bed and pillows.  The living area was warm and cosy and there was plenty of wood supplied for the fireplace.
Robyn was extremely generous with the provisions supplied and the kitchen had all the appliances you would need.  As well, there were plenty of glasses, plates, cutlery etc.  We spent our first night sampling the bottle of very nice Shiraz left for our enjoyment.  The gardens and grounds of Robyn's house are beautiful and would imagine they would be more so in the Spring and Summer months.
We did not use the spa or bbq so can't comment on those, but the area they are in is very nice indeed and would be great to enjoy on not such a cold weekend.
The Barossa Farmer's Market on Saturday morning is highly recommended.  We also had wonderful meals at Vintners, Angaston and 1918 in Tanunda.
I would wholeheartedly recommend Robyn's house for your stay in the Barossa.  
Do note however, that there is no early check in available unless you pay for an extra day in advance."
12856765,305770648,2018-08-12,206391076,Morgan,"Robyn's place was beautifully appointed with lots of thoughtful touches. She went above and beyond as a host by meeting us on arrival to show us around  and by driving us to our dinner reservation at Hentley Farm.
Particularly special features included the fireplace, spa, fresh local produce for breakfast and the chooks!"
12856765,309837391,2018-08-19,15740583,Andrew,Our stay was lovely. Robyn was really accommodating and the house was wonderfully cosy and perfect for what we were after. The house had everything it said it would and is a great location to Tanunda. 
12856765,312611564,2018-08-24,22907598,Rosalind,Robyn truely deserves her super host  status. Absolutely every thoughtful touch was evident in all she did. Great local cheese and fruit plus a beautiful bottle of wine to welcome us.
12856765,313707295,2018-08-26,3591001,Kristy,"A fantastic stay in Angaston. This house had everything. 4 comfortable rooms, multiple bathrooms, a great kitchen and dining table for big meals and it was walking distance to the shops and pub.
The hot tub was HOT but very relaxing and the karaoke machine certainly got a workout. What a fantastic stay we had with a few other couples. Thank you."

12856765,329895257,2018-09-30,28892365,Paola,"Robyn & Andrew are wonderful hosts! They go above and beyond to offer fenomenal service. We can’t thank them enough for all the help with our wedding logistics and for helping us organising a lovely family picnic the day after the wedding. Most importantly, they made us feel at home. We had the best time at their place, it’s a beautiful house, sparkling clean and equiped with all the required items that you could possibly need. We travelled with my two months old niece and Robyn & Andrew made sure she had all that she needed. We will definitely stay there again!"
12856765,331155420,2018-10-01,119705637,Sharona,An amazing property. The second time now that I have stayed there. Robyn has thought of every little detail and supplies the house with great local produces. Very relaxing enjoying a wine in the spa or by the wooden fire. The photos really do not do the house justice. An amazing stay and Robyn is so helpful with suggestions. Will be booking again forsure.
12856765,333168502,2018-10-07,72184964,Joanna,Fabulous house with character and lots of features. Garden is beautiful- perfect for birdwatching from the veranda.

12856765,347109886,2018-11-10,194251270,Karen,"Excellent location, lots to do nearby (Robyn gave us loads of options and ideas) or plenty of space to relax at the property (especially the spa). This was our return  girls trip for the second year ..very relaxing  The side garden facing the creek was pure bliss...we all sat out there and became totally “zen” "
12856765,356033255,2018-12-06,70055260,Eleanor,"What an incredible place. Fantastic location for wine touring, excellent communication and wonderful fresh, local produce provided for delicious breakfasts (and some wine for the spa).

12856765,407655549,2019-02-02,110574999,Crystal,"This place is spectacular. There were little touches everywhere that were great, like shampoo, soap, makeup remover in the main bathroom. The spa was fantastic and it was a bit too warm to have a fire but the fire pit was all set up for us anyways. We had a great time using the karaoke machine and it was so nice to be able to cook up a breakfast with the fully stocked fridge provided. The beds were so comfortable as well. Robyn even pointed us in the right direction for restaurants etc and kept communication with us the entire time in case we needed something. We will be back to the Barossa and will definitely book this home again."
12856765,415964642,2019-02-24,52979642,Rachel,"Our stay here was wonderful! The hospitality provided by Robyn & Andrew was wonderful. Made for a great weekend in the Barossa! 
The winery tour and grazing lunch was wonderful! They took us to a little ‘diamond in the rough’ winery which was very special! Would recommend!"
12856765,422395817,2019-03-11,34604502,Jessica,"Thank you Robyn for providing such a gorgeous property. Extremely spacious, very relaxing surroundings and conveniently close to the town centre (without feeling like it). All four of us who stayed for our girls weekend found the beds to be comfortable and the linen immaculately clean. The food that was left for us was amazing, we made up a wonderful platter to enjoy on the back deck. All in all we had a fantastic time and definitely recommend!!!"
12856765,433658412,2019-04-07,77076464,Kate,"Really well equipped place, had everything you could possibly need and plenty more. Very accommodating host, great location and value for money with all the extras provided. Really enjoyed our stay."
12856765,440438181,2019-04-21,74691724,Maddy,Robyn provided us with beautiful local produce and a bottle of wine on arrival. We spent the day touring around Barossa with her suggestions and transport - lots of fun had. She made an amazing platter for lunch which was to die for! Highly recommend.
12856765,442588454,2019-04-24,248603934,Peter,"Good base for exploring the barossa.  Clean and comfortable accomadation. Nice place with a private and spacious surrounding.  

Nice touches throughout the home from the host.

Highly recommended."
12856765,448206107,2019-05-05,210653089,Rebecca,Highly recommend this gorgeous house in its beautiful setting. Robyn was excellent to communicate with and the amenities were more than we expected. We thoroughly loved our stay and hope to be back one day soon. It's a credit to you Robyn.
12856765,451532031,2019-05-12,156505428,David,"This house was fabulous to stay in.  From the wood burning stove already stoked, and the hot spa, to the amazing breakfast supplies and wine and cheese platter.  Robyn is an amazing host, she met us at the house gave us a tour and explained how everything worked, and where to find things.  The house is in a great location with loads of wineries close by and the farmers markets.  Highly recommend it and would love to stay again!"
12856765,491887333,2019-07-21,268747718,Liam,"Truly the best weekend of my life, cannot recommend highly enough. Book here if you want to have an amazing time."
12856765,501658547,2019-08-04,13085786,Carol,"Robyn's house in the Barossa is absolutely fabulous for a group.  It's so close to the gorgeous township of Angaston (literally 5 min walk if that).  Robyn is one of the most generous hosts, leaving delicious provisions and treats, ample towels (including spa towels), outdoor blankets, umbrellas (we didn't need them) and anything else you can think of to make your stay first class.  There was plenty of heating to keep us warm and the beds were comfortable and beautifully made-up.  We had a ball with 3 generations on the karaoke machine, playing coits, even got the twister game out!  So much fun, thanks so much Robyn."
12856765,516775566,2019-08-25,4287547,Jenny,"Robyn was the perfect host!!! She organised us a beautiful tour through the Barossa, including wine tours, an amazing lunch and a gin tour!! Her welcome cheese platter was amazing, as was the ridiculously awesome local breakfast provisions.. the spa was great as was the fire - overall this was the best Airbnb I’ve ever been to, thank you!!!"
12856765,521477859,2019-09-01,44880174,Kassey,Great location and very spacious place.
12856765,529470150,2019-09-15,117219796,Lynette,Robyn is a great host and truly is a wealth of information about the local area. We really enjoyed our stay!
12856765,533647927,2019-09-22,115550773,Rebecca,"We were blown away by all the extra touches Robyn left for us.  So many treats - we’ve stayed in a lot of Airbnb places but never had this before! The space was perfect for two families and Robyn provided a baby cot, high chair, changing mat and toys which were all in great condition.  Lovely comfy beds and bed linen, plenty of towels and thorough instructions on how everything works.   It’s a very homely log cabin - and perfectly warm for a cool spring weekend.  We loved it and would definitely recommend."
12856765,564479856,2019-11-15,125052135,Sylvia,"Robyn is a wonderful, thoughtful host. We were extremely comfortable in her house and were spoiled with all the treats she left for us. We couldn’t have asked for anything more! Thank you Robyn."
12856765,578209739,2019-12-16,136668864,Thomas,Really nice house. Right in the middle of everything.
12856765,616174813,2020-03-09,188444048,Delta,"Delightful stay for our 'home base' during a long weekend of family time and celebration.
Robyn and Andrew were ever so gracious and the local produce and treats were a lovely addition to what is already a perfect spot.  Such a lovely time was had by all.  Thank you!"
12856765,625833669,2020-05-24,50646921,Alizée,"We had an amazing time at Robyn’s place, we really enjoyed our stay. Thank you again."
12856765,628068554,2020-06-07,114525964,Dave,We had a great getaway with our family for a few nights. The fire was very cozy and lots of space for the kids to run around outside
12856765,628591020,2020-06-08,89744110,Tiara,Lovely host lovely  place
12856765,637046182,2020-07-12,157449041,Sofia,"A wonderful house in Angaston township. Beautiful garden, relaxing spa and loved the indoor fireplace. The extra touches of board games and amenities made the experience a fantastic Barossa getaway."
12856765,663084815,2020-09-11,150366766,Brad,"Robyn’s place was great for our stay, we were in the area for work but I’m planning to go back to beautiful Angaston and hopefully stay again, communication with Robyn was very easy and she was more then helpful, highly recommend Robyn’s beautiful home"
12856765,665911102,2020-09-20,349846243,Shannon,"This gem in Angaston is an amazing stay. The gardens and lawn are beautiful, the interior of the house is stunning, and the amenities such as the spa were incredible. 

There were so many places locally to see and no shortage of things we could do. The town is beautiful and the local area around it hides some sweet spots in our stay like the Tanunda Bakery which had so many treats, we had to come back the next day.

After dark there was ample space to play board games with friends and spread out in the lounge and share a story or two. The spa was the icing on the cake and we used it both nights we stayed and even considered cheekily using it before we left.

Robyn was an outstanding host and went incredibly far to make us feel comfortable and to give us recommendations on great places to go while we were in Angaston.

If you're a group of people looking to get away for a weekend, you simply must stay here. It will be the highlight of your trip."
12856765,668247509,2020-09-27,94116760,Sam,"Very cute place, big open living spaces make nights in a breeze."
12856765,673087974,2020-10-11,73236170,Matthew,"Great place, easy to get around. Very picturesque!"
12856765,706039825,2020-11-01,96013732,Jenny,"While this property offered plenty of accommodation and amenities for our family, we were disappointed in the lack of attention paid to cleaning, in particular, the oven.  We found the decor tired and dingy rather than cosy and comfortable. 
Some of the items left in the “complimentary breakfast” were past their used by date.  It all added up to us feeling a bit “ripped off” as it wasn’t cheap accommodation.  We can’t believe the comments by previous occupants. We’re we really staying in the same place!"
12856765,707269273,2020-11-07,314602306,Jessica,"The host is great, nothing too much trouble. Provided us with all the information we needed to enjoy our stay. The property is set in lovey grounds, the spa was great to relax in, there is a sound system inside and out so we were able to play music from our phones. Lovely quirky place perfect for a weekend getaway."
12856765,722078523,2021-01-05,144533865,Riley,The perfect place to base yourself for a Barossa trip. The house has a lot of character and all the amenities you need. Loved the spa in particular!
12856765,725120812,2021-01-17,25728509,Kim,A lovely and comfortable house to stay in and very nice welcome basket with lots of goodies to enjoy. Location is also great.
12856765,726303637,2021-01-24,32099316,Bastian,"Robyn's place is beautifully nestled in Angaston, the pictures don't do it justice. We had a great relaxing weekend here, everyone loved it!"
12856765,726926796,2021-01-25,274967212,Gemma,"Thanks so much for having us stay Robyn, such a picturesque place! stunning gardens perfect for our wedding 2.0 photos. everyone loved the spa & all the little touches. Thanks again. Legend"
12856765,729355613,2021-02-07,63539973,Niki,"We had a girls weekend away at this cosy two-story log cabin and we couldnt have been happier with our choice! Robyn was very helpful with local tips, and the house is an easy walk to the main street for some cafes. The lounge, dining and outdoor areas gives you ample space for a larger group (we had 3) or a family. Would love to come back again."
12856765,736899565,2021-03-07,388099041,Adam,"Beautiful and quiet, great base for a getaway!"
12906285,136634345,2017-03-11,23493921,Coral,Rebekah and Ed's place was gorgeous. Simple yet stylish and as noted in the description based on the 1950's era. Very clean with all the things we required for our stay. Beck was easy to contact and her communication was very prompt. The main Street of Angaston was less than ten minutes walk and we enjoyed trying out some of the suggestions for dining including Roaring 40's pizza and Vintners Inn. Bed was brand new and very comfortable. Bathroom had just recently been renovated and was spotless. Would recommend this place for anyone visiting the Barossa.
12906285,138470739,2017-03-19,59665769,Greta,"This is a beautiful house in a quiet neighbourhood of the Barossa valley. The house is a good size for 2-4 guests with vintage furniture to complete the look. Rebekah was very helpful and quick to respond and was happy to leave us to our own devices. With a car it's very easy to get around the area but we recommend booking a tour if you want to indulge in the wine. We went for a fantastic dinner at Vintners Bar and Grill, just outside of Angaston. 
The house is a short walk into  town, where you will find a couple of pubs, cafes, a wine bar and food store. "
12906285,139525413,2017-03-25,116740540,Toni,"What a delightfully gorgeous 50's house - so full of charm. Rebekah has prepared the house perfectly for guests - the style, cleanliness, little extras, comfortable beds and beautifully renovated bathroom and laundry are a delight.  We highly recommend it for anyone travelling in the region - close to the main street of Angaston and a few short kilometres from Tununda. Rebekah's hospitality was second to none. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us."
12906285,143664608,2017-04-12,53870696,Jacqui,"Rebekah is a fabulous host. Quick to respond when you need her. House is quiet and cosy. Heaps of space inside with lots of cute little outdoor spaces in the garden. Large bedrooms with extremely comfy beds. Very practical and clean kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Lovely walk into town. Slight hill coming back. Gas heater was much appreciated and warmed the house quickly. ❤️"
12906285,144929755,2017-04-16,54922944,Tom,"Cool little house, clean and great location. Rebekah was very attentive to our needs. Highly recommended.  "
12906285,146414965,2017-04-22,105415228,Stuart,"We had a lovely stay at the 1950s retro cottage hosted by Rebekah.  Rebekah was very quick to respond and made sure everything was ok with our stay. There was a delicious bottle of red left for us and some breakfast provisions.
It's a short walk to the main street of Angaston with a good choice of restaurants and shops. Angaston is a pretty town and a great spot base a Barossa visit."
12906285,149541649,2017-05-04,35761139,Kay,It's like stepping back into the 50's brought back many childhood memories. Good value for money

A short walk to the pretty township for a meal, drink and food shop. The Host is excellent to communicate with and offers a gorgeous 50/60's period decorated house, that s perfectly fitted out for a stay - good kitchen facilities and utensils for a night in with with great Barossa Produce. "
12906285,167216497,2017-07-06,23990599,Travis,Really great property. We loved the 1950's style. The place was very clean and we even got a little treat upon arrival. Next time we are in the area we would definitely stay there again

Very clean and functional   Lovely retro furniture.  Location easy 10 minute stroll to main street.  Communication with Rebekah very easy.  Highly recommend as barossa accommodation location.  For me Angaston is the loveliest of the towns in barossa tegion"
12906285,186901150,2017-08-26,17914375,Elisabeth,"Perfect location for exploring all the Barossa has to offer. Easy walk into Angaston for restaurants, supermarket, etc. Great wineries and scenery within a short drive. Very clean and a cool decor, easy check-in. Well-equipped kitchen if you want to take advantage of the great local produce - check out the Farmers Market on Saturday mornings in Angaston. Highly recommended!"

Lots of space inside and out with a lovely big backyard full of beautiful roses. The house was in walking distance to Angaston town centre and a good area to stay to visit wineries in the region. Would definitely stay again!
12906285,208549845,2017-11-02,391966,Barbara,"Easy access to this property is so convenient and the yard is beautiful to sit and enjoy a glass of wine. Everything was immaculate. We made use of the washing machine and hung our clothes to dry, greatly appreciated after traveling for two weeks.  We spent three days at Rebekah’s and found it very central for exploring the Barossa Valley. Fantatic time, and if we are ever back this way would certainly stay here again"
12906285,224681020,2018-01-04,2112465,Jasmine,Very clean and beautiful space. Bed and sofa not very comfortable. Nice area for walks
12906285,228254412,2018-01-18,23493921,Coral,"This was our second visit to Angaston.Also our second stay at Rebekah’s beautiful Airbnb.
This place has Everything travellers need and more.
Lots of extra touches.
Very comfortable beds with quality bed linen and towels.
The garden has been transformed a lovely area to sit and have a glass of wine which Rebekah provides.
It’s in a quiet residential area but easy access to shops and wineries.
Great restaurants within easy driving or some walking distance.
Keep up the great standard us travellers really enjoy finding such comfortable places.
We will be back."
12906285,229491875,2018-01-24,116740540,Toni,"Our stay in this retro cottage was perfect. It was well appointed with everything that we needed for a comfortable stay; especially the beds! The house is a short stroll from the main street of Angaston and in the heart of the wineries. The kitchen had everything we needed for self-catering but we took the opportunity to enjoyed dinner at Vintners one night as well. Handy wifi and laundry facilities (with powder!). There are plenty of cafes in walking distance with great coffee. 

The attention to detail was incredible. From the authentic 1950’s décor, through to the modern luxuries (love that they give you TWO kinds of pillow!) this place is a joy to stay in. Did I also mention there’s wine provided for you, that’s made personally by the winemaker owner?? Can’t wait to come back for a longer holiday!”

Can't recommend enough.
 "
12906285,229839637,2018-01-25,103619387,Rachael,"Lovely quiet place, had no issues with anything. Everything was exactly as described. Only a short drive (for the lazy) into town for dinner."

12906285,253256541,2018-04-14,178725822,Daniel,"Extremely well appointed house located in the heart of the Barossa.  Local bread, jam and wine on arrival was a very nice touch. Will definitely stay again."
12906285,266962397,2018-05-21,706416,Kevin,"We stayed for 3 nights at Rebekah’s Airbnb and enjoyed our stay! It's great that she restored a classic/retro-style home and it was much more spacious than we anticipated. It had all the amenities one would hope for in an Airbnb, and she was kind enough to leave us some local welcome items (fresh bread, jam, milk, wine, etc.). These little touches improve the check-in experience, so it's great she adds that extra touch. The home is spacious, the location is central (close to what you'd want to explore in Barossa Valley), and Rebekah's communication was fantastic. Overall, a great experience and I'd recommend her place for anyone that needs a centrally-located home in the Barossa Valley.  Thanks!"
12906285,280700009,2018-06-24,28892365,Paola,Beautiful house and amazing hosts. The details and retro decor from the house are great. Thanks Rebekah for your assistance with our late check-in and for your hospitality. We would definitely stay again.

12906285,290633593,2018-07-15,163095011,Janet,"What a stylish and playfully decorated place! Every little touch has been carefully chosen and this makes for a lovely stay. The Continental breakfast provisions and complimentary wine made life easy within a fully stocked kitchen with any pan or utensil you could possibly need. The linens were good quality, especially the quilt, and the bed is best for those who prefer a firm mattress. It is in a quiet neighbourhood close to all the delights of the Barossa. Netflix on the big TV was a treat to wind down after being out and about. Rebecca communicated clearly and quickly and checked in during our stay that we had everything we needed. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a stay at Rebecca’s place!"

12906285,418752055,2019-03-03,163725713,Murray,"This charming house on a quiet street in Angaston  provided the perfect accommodation for our weekend in the Barossa. 
Each room was well appointed within the theme of period 1950’s, but of course the modern conveniences there to remind you we are in the 21st century. 
The bathroom was large and modern and offered all the necessary amenities. Beds were comfy and pillows cloud-like. 
Although we didn’t make it out there for longer than a two-minute arrival sticky-beak, the backyard has massive potential if staying for longer - with BBQ area and beautiful garden beds full of life (the sunflowers were blooming when we were there )
It is a short, pleasant downhill walk through the recreation grounds to the Main Street - so despite feeling like you’re on the outskirts, the property is really well situated to everything. 
Beck was supreme with her advice and communication - the ideal host! 
If we make it back to Angaston, we’d love to retro-it-up again."
12906285,431453594,2019-04-01,200882768,Lauren,"Wow, what an awesome experience! A gorgeous little place in immaculate condition with plenty of quirky retro charm. Loved the gardens both front and back, a short stroll from the Main Street, and a great base for a Barossa food and wine gorge!!!"

12906285,462133717,2019-06-02,34181114,Kiaran,"This is a wonderful place to stay.  The house is an original 1950s place, with a beautiful rose garden at the front.  The interior is beautifully done out in very stylish original (refurbished) 1950s furniture, and there is a fantastic, spacious modern bathroom with an excellent shower.  The location is terrific - just a few minute walk to the very picturesque centre of the town, a few minutes drive to the fantastic Saturday morning Barossa Farmers Market, and with vineyards and wineries (including the wonderful and historic Yalumba site) just minutes away.  As numerous people have commented, the house is spotlessly clean and Beck is a superb and friendly host.  There was a bottle of local Jersey milk in the fridge, coffee and tea, and breakfast provisions provided, together with oils, sauces, herbs and spices for cooking.  The kitchen itself is very well equipped with high quality equipment - a cook's kitchen that we very much enjoyed spending time and preparing meals in.  And the beds were particularly comfortable.  Altogether a wonderful base from which to explore the Barossa Valley.  Highly recommended!"

The fresh local produce left for us was plentiful & delicious including wine and chocolates, and we knew there was always help at hand even though we had complete privacy. Both beds were really comfy with soft warm doonas as well as a lighter cotton blanket for warmer nights. There was a little bit of street noise from passing traffic but not enough to wake us up. It was ideally located in town within easy walking distance to cafes, pubs & places to eat. I'd love to come back in winter to enjoy the fireplace. What a gorgeous cottage! We loved our visit to Angaston which was made even better by our lovely hosts. "

The cottage is cozy and super relaxing with a back patio to die for. The kitchen makes me want to be a master chef and was stocked with all sort of delicious goodies. Simply put, stay at the Bluebird—it was absolutely splendid!"

The tour of surrounding wineries and places of interest with Jim was the icing on the cake. It’s a shame we live so far away, we’d be back in the beautiful Barossa in a heartbeat. 

Thanks Jim and Jeanette for your wonderful hospitality.
Kind regards, 
Sue and Bruce"

On entering the property you quickly realise that you are dealing with a sensational host.  The little additions of biscuits, wine and the list goes on ( no spoilers here) will make your stay one of peacefulness and comfort.  The ambience and history of the cottage is first class, and please do not think stone cottage and dingy, this cottage is far from that.  Henri let us settle in and then offered to provide some local knowledge.  I would strong,y recommend you take him up on the offer because it will make your touring of the region that much better.  Thanks Henri, you are a great host and the cottage is fabulous.  We will see you again when we next travel to the Barossa or Clare valleys."

Henri added personal touches in preparation for our arrival which was very thoughtful.  We enjoyed eating in at night and were able to use BBQ/oven to cook our locally bought supplies - yum!  Very homely feeling.
His tips for things to do (highly recommend Daimler Winery Tour with John)  and wineries to visit were spot on.  We couldn't ask for anything more - the perfect place for us to enjoy our first visit to the Barossa Valley area.  Thank you Henri."

Henri was a fantastic host, who had taken care to ensure we were comfortable and the details he had thought of were extraordinary! He had thought of everything for every guest, and was very friendly.

Henri provided such a fantastic variety of breakfast foods, snacks, and provisions to last us the weekend. He was quick to respond to questions and went out of his way to make the experience as comfortable as possible for us. I don't think I've experienced such hospitality at an Airbnb before."

It has a full kitchen / dinning, lounge, sunroom, bedroom and separate bathroom. Plenty of space and sparkling clean. Henri provides so many extras its hard to list, breakfast, wine, cheese plate, chocolate just to name a few. It's private location is lovely but you are still only mins drive from town and a heap of wineries. Highly recommend this gorgeous cottage. Our host Henri was lovely, answering all our questions and checking in on us to make sure we had arrived safely.  Great stay."

The heritage farm-style accommodation was spacious and comfortable, in character with the family's working winery. jo was a gracious hostess who thoughtfully provided more than basic b&b essentials and all kinds of local knowledge that added to our Barossa experience. Highly recmmended"

Jo was very accommodating who thoughtfully provided lots of local knowledge in the pamphlets/maps in the common areas. It was only a bit of a challenge for us when we wanted to cook up a feast as the kitchen was basically equipped. Nevertheless, we managed it with a big team effort and served up one of the meals of our trip!"

There were thoughtful touches like honey biscuits and port, farm fresh eggs with fresh bread and homemade marmalade.

14269050,566315231,2019-11-19,14181700,Joey,"Beautiful location! Welcoming host with lots of effort. Place and furnishings on the older side but majority still functional. Bedroom situation was confusing. Was a surprise that there was an extra fee for use of extra bedroom. Fine for couples who share one room but for friends who wanted separate rooms, I would have preferred this fee to be included from the beginning."

The living area is just like the photos, everything was clean and had everything you needed to cook up the farm fresh eggs we were provided with. Their property is the real bonus though. We loved our walk around the huge acreage seeing all of the sheep, vines and bird life. It’s was close enough to visit all the wineries by car. Overall great stay."

14377105,421177422,2019-03-08,79448304,Michelle,"A spotlessly clean house that is on a busy road just on the outskirts of Angaston. We were only given access to two bedrooms but I think there are three. Two very large and modern bathrooms, one with a bath, the other with a spa bath. An outside sitting area that feels a bit like sitting in a car park. 
We had some check in difficulties, it wasn’t clear that we had to go to a nearby winery to get the key. The host kindly let us check in early but then we ran late getting to our function because of time trying to contact the host and getting the key. 
No breakfast provisions, but a large kitchen."

14697430,588655595,2020-01-04,127411501,Alicia,"John’s cottage is so cute and a super authentic old country house. It is filled with beautiful heritage ornaments and artefacts, is super clean and has great facilities! We had a lovely time relaxing in the house in between visiting wineries and restaurants :)"
14697430,591754690,2020-01-12,159339005,Brian,"Fantastic period property, very clean, comfortable and lovely touches from John. Would recommend and will be back."

14697430,616183966,2020-03-09,92595576,Sarah,"Beautiful rustic historic cottage in idyllic, private, peaceful area. Perfect for a couple or two couples wanting to enjoy an adventure in the Barossa. Great home base. Nearest shops are located in Angaston."
14697430,630939786,2020-06-21,118353375,Jillian,"It was a chilly day, but the heater was already on for us, so the house and the upstairs bedroom were toasty when we arrived. The chilly weather turned into a pretty serious storm, but Lemke Cottage is so well built and maintained that there were no cold draughts; the house didn't even creak in the wind! We built a fire in the combustion heater from the well-stocked kindling and woodpile, and weathered the storm with some port. So comfortable and well-appointed.

The kitchen had everything needed for breakfast. There's a gas stove and double oven if you want to cook more, though we took advantage of the local restaurants: Fermentasian (fantastic!) and Fino at Seppeltsfield (quite good). The sunken bathtub and shower had plenty of hot hot water, and the bathroom has a laundry and tumble dryer, so we could even dry and fluff our towels.

Moculta is a beautiful little hamlet, with kookaburras at dawn, rosellas and fairy wrens, so we enjoyed a lazy morning with the birdsong. Wish we could have stayed much longer."

14697430,636046018,2020-07-09,185144425,Tamara,A unique and truly perfect cottage experience in the Barossa. The loft is as warm and comfortable as it is gorgeous! Little treats left were such a kind touch and we are so glad we spent our first family night in the Barossa here. Thank you!
14697430,648522832,2020-08-09,35853143,Diane,"John's place is a quiet retreat filled with wonderful items from the past. The location is great to visit anything in the Barossa Valley. Checkin was very easy. There is ducted heating, as well as a combustion heater which is in the formal dining area. The open fire place in the lounge area is not operational. There are plenty of other heaters if needed. The loft stays warmer than downstairs at night time. The bed was very comfy - ensured a great nights sleep. continental breakfast provided was generous, with  tea/hot chocolate and a coffee machine. Kitchen fit out excellent. The bath was great, the shower we could not get to give us a consistent good flow of warm water.  Very clean and tidy. Great communicaton."

14828790,102303674,2016-09-17,12127546,Matt,"Seriously brilliant stay. Anthony (filling in for Alicia whilst she was away) did a top job with recommendations and the 'room' was actually an apartment. Extremely comfy bed, fantastic shower and a zero degrees plunge pool to get rid of the hangover :) 

Couldn't recommend highly enough. 

Vintner's is a 4 minute drive away for the farmer's market and a fantastic dinner, if you're over Barossa wines there's a great little authentic Italian place across the bridge from the White House and you can walk to the bike rental place which is directly opposite the bike trail. You can cycle to a number of wineries from there. 

Top trip. Thanks again. 

Matt and Bryony "

The pool was amazing to cool down and relax on the hot days.
The place was big and comfortable, lovely clean bathroom and facilities, great tv and wifi.
The bottle of wine to welcome us was a lovely touch.
There's also a wealth of information and recommendations for what to see and do in the area. 
We can't recommend the White house more highly! Alicia and Anthony are great hosts. Unbeatable value.

14843749,258273382,2018-04-29,30572170,Gavin,"Happy with the accommodation. Not happy with the beds. I asked for a King, and got 2 Very Slim single mattresses pushed together. The linen reminded me of a Hospital linen in the 1930's. I just thought that if the bedding was up to scratch, it is worth the price. But i didn't get any sleep at all, my wife and i slept in separate beds because of the beds being way under what you would expect.!! Budget sleeping accommodation.!"

We picked it because it had plenty of rooms. We did not realise it also splits into separate rents if required. 
For our stay all doors were unlocked so the units flowed. 

Old / antique décor - an interesting place to stay.

Would recommend booking the wine tour through the house too."
14969874,157399297,2017-06-03,3752053,Sonia,"Thank you Kym for a wonderful stay in the most beautiful house in Tanunda.  All the communication from the day I booked the house (and then accidently cancelled it) and then to the purchase of the food processor so we could make our pumpkin soup on the first night, was fantastic.  Response was always quick.  The house was beautiful, everything that we required was there and and in plentiful supply.  If we ever stay in the Barossa again we would have no hesitation in staying there again!.  Thank you so much again.  "

Walking distance to shops for a little bit of retail therapy or relaxing in a cute little cafe for a coffee.. but far enough out of the Main Street to have a lots of privacy! 

We also made use of their bus transfer services to get to and from Hentley Farm restaurant and the bus drive Bob was an absolute delight!

We choose to do the hop on hop off bus around the valley and the house was the perfect place to come back to after a busy day!

Within an easy walking distance to shops and cafes, and an easy drive to the numerous wineries in the area, this was an ideal location to set up for the weekend. The house itself was comfortable and well-furnished, with a lovey backyard that we couldn't utilise to the fullest given the weather.

Bridget was very prompt on communications, and an easy host to deal with. House access was straightforward and as described, and we'd highly recommend her place as a location for a weekend in the Barossa. "

This house was perfect, beautifully decorated and endless spots to hang out. We spent most of our time around the big wooden table in the kitchen and had everything we needed to cook up a big feast. 

The garden was also stunning, we would love to come back in Spring/Summer and spend a bit more time outdoors.

Bridget was so welcoming and helpful and this place was more than comfy. We will definitely be back!"

We started our stay with a lovely personalised note wishing our baby a happy birthday and her detailed notes made us feel right at home. her chemical free living and her bookshelf is admirable!
The best part was her offer to use any fruit from her backyard so we had 3 days of the best ever tree to table orange juice

The fruit trees were in full swing and we enjoyed many apricots and peaches (thanks Bridget). A great location to begin our exploration of the Barossa Valley - our favourite winery must have been Rockford but there are so many great ones. 
Tanunda itself seemed a little underwhelming after having visited other areas in and around Adelaide but still had some great cafes and restaurants. All of which are just at the end of the road from Bridget’s place."

15132613,309837574,2018-08-19,59848223,Ben,"'Home' is a word we never take for granted. It's a place that simply can't be manufactured; shaped by your life story, and what makes it your private escape. You walk through the door, and you feel at home. 

At Bridget's place, we felt like we'd come home to a different life for a few precious days. It's a parallel dimension – like a dream so vivid you swear it could be real, only better; you really can go back and relive it all again.

No other place has made us smile quite as much as Bridget's place. It's chock full of character, from the 'help yourself' board for the edible garden to the artwork, books, vintage magazines and curious memorabilia.

We hope to return someday!

15132613,545233766,2019-10-12,1696780,Leah,We had a such a lovely stay at Bridget's place. The house had all the amenities we needed & it was very convenient for accessing the Barossa Valley. The garden was in full bloom & it was so relaxing sitting outside on the back porch.
15132613,551114776,2019-10-20,5031415,Anna,"We loved Bridget’s place. Its walking distance from everything we could need in town and 5-10min drive from some amazing wineries. 
The garden is spectacular and the place itself is stylish and very clean without the use of chemicals. 
It’s got a great kitchen for cooking some local foods, we can’t recommend it highly enough."
15132613,553335013,2019-10-23,62017070,Tessa,"Bridget's place is ideally located just off the main street of Tanunda, in walking distance to everything in town and you can drive to countless wineries in minutes. The house is very homely, with a lovely outdoor area in a peaceful garden (and a very cool indoor when the temperature rises!!). Bridget is a wonderful host who welcomes you to her home with little extras that really make your stay. It was great for us (two friends) but plenty of room for two couples as well. Highly recommend this place as a base to the delights of the Barossa."
15132613,556584534,2019-10-30,300505,Antoinette & Kevin,"This is a wonderful area to visit and Bridgets place was centrally located. It was comfortable, spacious and exactly what we wanted. The extra touches like breakfast made it seem like a cosy home. We loved our stay here."
15132613,559410269,2019-11-04,25868516,Amanda,Bridget’s place was just perfect! A beautifully styled house with lots of character and charm in the perfect location - walking distance from the main street and a short drive to a gateway of wineries. A truly lovely place to enjoy some downtime.
15132613,560836557,2019-11-08,154502832,Susan,Bridget’s House is very conveniently located only a very short walk to the Tanunda shops and restaurants.  We found the kitchen very well set up and particularly appreciated the delicious cheese left for us in the fridge.  We enjoyed a wine on the deck on more than one occasion overlooking the lovely garden and hope to return to enjoy more of Bridget’s hospitality.
15132613,565828189,2019-11-17,21887085,Kate,"We are fussy about beds and linen and these were as good as it gets! Amazing location, will return."

15132613,577018765,2019-12-14,39564884,Jenn,Incredibly cosy and inviting. The back porch invites lazy mornings and long afternoons in the shade. Incredibly peaceful--wish we could have stayed longer!
15132613,583554355,2019-12-28,36916137,Douglas,"Bridget’s place feels like a home. It has an awesome kitchen for cooking a delicious meal, a gorgeous patio for enjoying breakfast or a few drinks in the sun and is within walking distance to all the major Tanunda shops. Short drive to all the wineries and taxis will take you anywhere for dinner too."
15132613,589398913,2020-01-05,40360228,Jason,"We spent 2 nights at Bridgets house in Tanunda which was a perfect base for our Barossa weekend getaway. The house was very cosy and inviting and the back deck was the perfect spot to sample some of the local produce. Bridget is also a fantastic host, very responsive and easy to communicate with. Highly recommend!"
15132613,591324966,2020-01-10,57943298,Ben,"Great host, location and value. Loved the eclectic style. Host was very responsive."
15132613,592818261,2020-01-13,11718324,Paul,We really enjoyed our stay. The house is very stylishly furnished. It was great to enjoy the garden from the back deck. Highly recommended

15132613,598366118,2020-01-27,281991265,Mr P,Lovely peaceful garden and great outdoor spaces. House was fantastic and well appointed as well. The pick your own fruit was a real treat. Location was excellent and would definitely stay there again.
15132613,601641032,2020-02-04,22041060,Karen,"We chose to stay at Bridgets place in Tanunda so that we could spend time checking out the Barossa Valley.  We were also able to join an organised winery tour from Tanunda. 
Bridgets place was a lovely space that had everything we needed and was only a couple of minutes walk from the town which had a number of good cafes, restaurants and wine bars as well as a tourist information centre for the area."
15132613,603238380,2020-02-09,118324699,Morgan,An absolutely gorgeous home! Beautiful location and super convenient for everything ! Loved our stay !
15132613,608514429,2020-02-20,58437722,Jen,"We, my husband my parents and our 10 months old son stayed at Bridgets  place for 2 nights while visiting the Barossa. It’s a beautiful place- you feel like at home when you enter the door. There’s a wonderful garden (a lot of fruit trees, herbs etc) in the back and it’s just beautiful. Would highly recommend her place. It’s also a perfect location for exploring the Barossa and with a lot of options for dinner just around the corner "
15132613,609388503,2020-02-22,25612249,James,"Great location, very relaxing laying outside on the day bed. Great location with the main Street just around the corner. Friendly host. Would stay again"

15132613,615385478,2020-03-07,4202780,Amy,"Bridget’s place is absolutely delightful: cosy, clean and beautifully decorated. It’s in a perfect spot, so close to amenities, but the backyard feels lovely and tranquil. Highly recommended."
15132613,616846766,2020-03-11,86170221,Mariano,"This place was a real find, a stroke of luck since we booked it last-minute. My friends and I couldn't have been happier with the accommodations - we much prefer the feel of living in a real house instead of a company-managed property. The back deck was perfect for sitting in to enjoy the lovely weather, and the fruit trees and herb garden were an extra-special touch. There's a nice full bookshelf in the living room, and the rooms and beds are very comfortable. In short, the perfect place to recharge one's battery and the perfect base of operations for exploring all that the Barossa Valley has to offer. Bridget was very welcoming and available to answer any questions, we couldn't have asked for a better host."
15132613,619296938,2020-03-16,641299,Lisa,"Bridget, it was truly an absolute pleasure to have stayed in your home. Ourselves and our friends felt very welcomed and comfortable in the sanctuary that you have. We loved the garden and fresh produce that was seasonally on offer in our own little paradise. 
We cannot recommend this experience at Bridgets house more highly. Fabulous location, sparkling clean and tranquil. The Barossa is a magical region to explore and well worth the efforts of making your way to this town. Thornby Butcher is a must, to purchase an amazing cut of meat or roast in the Weber. Together with so many wineries and wine styles on offer makes this a perfect degustation destination. 
Wishing you all the very best Bridget. We’ll be sure to return someday."
15132613,620352964,2020-03-22,166872924,Mary,"Thank you Bridget! We had a great stay at your house. We found everything we needed and the space was so clean, well equipped and comfortable. We found the kitchen especially was well stocked with crockery and a good supply of pots and pans. We appreciated the fresh eggs, bread and milk. The beds were super comfy an the location was excellent too."
15132613,627625411,2020-06-04,302879258,Lucinda,Bridget’s place is a lovely home in the heart of Tanunda which is perfect for a weekend getaway. We enjoyed the slow combustion fire and having a glass of wine in the lovely garden. Bridget has provided thoughtful touches and the lovely art throughout the house is very welcoming.
15132613,629372289,2020-06-14,77858401,Jarrod,"Perfect house for what we were after, ideal location for winery visits"
15132613,630934586,2020-06-21,340460670,Andrew,"Fantastic location and Bridget is very responsive and helpful! Place is perfect for visiting Barossa and offers a nice, quiet and relaxing space."
15132613,636053991,2020-07-09,316058738,Grace,"Bridget’s place is a cosy little cottage, a perfect get away close to the main st and walking distance to all the best restaurants. The garden was a perfect place for photos before a wine tour and the kitchen perfect for cooking up a snack when you get back. Would highly recommend the house to anyone looking to explore the Barossa Valley."
15132613,637978488,2020-07-14,59706536,Rob,Great home base to explore the Barossa
15132613,639684641,2020-07-19,45239675,Maja,"Bridget’s house was beautiful, perfect location and her communication was great. HOWEVER, the issue we had in the end was when Bridget tried to make us pay an extra $100 cleaning fee saying that we left the place so filthy that her cleaner had to stay an EXTRA 3.5 hours on top of her usual 2 hours to clean up after our supposed huge mess. This was completely fabricated! We left the place extremely tidy, as my reviews always suggest, and we tried to explain this to Bridget advising that this was not the truth and that if she thought it was that her cleaner was potentially trying to get paid more. Bridget would not believe me, even though her cleaner had no proof or evidence of said mess. I would believe that if she was cleaning for 5.5 hours she would have taken photos of the mess. It was extremely disappointing and very stressful for us when we know we did not do what she was saying we did. Lastly, the back door lock was broken, which was entry into the property, and we had to fix this ourselves. 
However, if this issue didn’t happen it would have honestly been the loveliest stay as the house was amazing."
15132613,647914412,2020-08-08,41595115,Mel,"We really enjoyed staying here. Such a lovely house, a pleasure to be in and really well located. Could have hung out in the cheery kitchen in front of the fire for hours :)"

15132613,658096502,2020-08-30,357150628,Simone,Lovely period home in the heart of Tanunda. A very short walk to the main street and amenities. We would love to see this house with all the fruit trees in their full glory and really make use of that wonderful garden!
15132613,659766198,2020-09-03,191515323,Samantha,"Our stay at Bridget's was absolute bliss from the moment we booked, and further exceeded ALL expectations when we walked in the door! The house is so beautifully styled with the most amazing eccentric pieces and the homeliest of touches to top everything off. 
I am already planning my next stay to come back!! The cleanliness was outstanding as well as the best ammentaties I have experience within an Air B'n'B or self contained stay.
I absolutely cant wait to come back, I really didn't even want to leave haha!!  
I couldn't recommend this place any higher"
15132613,660787018,2020-09-06,41435749,Molly,"Cutest little house, but big enough to have your own space. Garden is so cute too. Too many lovely spaces you won’t know where to sit, and not want to leave!"
15132613,663456432,2020-09-12,131966807,Loan,Beautiful and calm home. Very clean with very thoughtful touches. All the amenities you could think of and a lovely garden which we enjoyed during our short trip. Location is 5 stars
15132613,668267682,2020-09-27,11221164,Susan,What a great home that we got to stay in. Super clean; comfy beds and a fire place to keep us warm. Great central location to everything. Bridget's house is really homely and Bridget has a great vege patch; the rocket was beautiful. Eggs for breakfast and some bread a welcome touch. Definitely love to return. We also loved all of the artwork which I believe is also one of Bridget's talents. Thanks so much for sharing your lovely home.
15132613,669488471,2020-09-30,158115147,Aiden,Amazing location and excellent place to stay in the barossa!
15132613,671394704,2020-10-04,127130148,David,"If you want a comfortable house-stay in the centre of the Barossa, then look no further. In the middle of Tanunda, it’s a very short walk to all the amenities you need and a short drive to the great wineries. If you’re lucky to get here at the right time, the garden has an array of fruit and herbs you can snack on, it’s all very nice. 

Highly recommended"
15132613,672256964,2020-10-08,109559906,Kelly,"Bridgets home will become your own. It’s sparkling clean and safe but also feels homey and comfortable. Barossa has SO MUch amazing stuff and Bridget pointed us in the perfect direction for our 3 day stay (+ consulted us on where to go in SA following our stay!). My partner and I had plenty of space here just the 2 of us, but also would be perfect for multi couples. The garden was a dream and we made salads and mains spiced with the fresh herbs from the backyard. Thanks again Bridget, I may venture to say it’s the best Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in (and I’ve stayed in many!!) "
15132613,673108796,2020-10-11,335770498,Annette,A great quiet place to stay with a fabulous “ homey “ feel about it
15132613,700719990,2020-10-15,46582333,Annabel,"Couldn’t have asked for a more welcoming and comfortable home to use as a base for a few days in the Barossa. The location is excellent, just a short walk to the Main Street on Tanunda and all its cafes/restaurants/shops and very central for day trips around the region. Can’t recommend Brigit’s place highly enough."

Bridget’s place felt like home to us. Very generous supplies, super comfy main bed (there was only two of us), great deck with a huge day bed and lots of seating over looking a lush and productive back garden. The location is superb... a very short walk to the Main Street with many places to eat and drink or just have a browse. Bridget was very quick to respond and left a very comprehensive folder of her favorite places and things to do in the Barossa. Highly recommend."

The furnishings are comfortable and stylish, great art, and funky features. The garden is enchanting and private and the proximity to main street is just a sort stroll from the front gate.  Would have loved to have stayed much longer."

15485550,155825449,2017-05-29,73888881,Avikar,"I loved staying in Melanie's house, it's very tastefully decorated, and one of the most well organised AirBnBs I have stayed in. There was no need to look for things,  everything was where you expect it to be...space in the fridge with a marked guest section and on the table, a continental breakfast.  A great place to stay for a Barossa visit."

The place is super clean and central if you are planning on visiting the wineries around the region. You can even walk to a few nearby ones, and walk to the main street for cafes and restaurants. A car is needed to see the rest. Good value overall. Good for couples or solo travellers."

15485550,230284174,2018-01-27,165683007,Malcolm,Melanie was a amiable host of a well presented cosy and Retro themed house. Very welcoming and close to shops and travel targets. Wonderful airconditioning a delight during the hot periods of the unusually high temp Summer. I would highly recommend Melanie and her home to any travellers to Tanunda and the Barossa generally.

We made use of the pool table in the living room when we weren’t out tasting wines. Melanie was friendly and quick with communication, we didn’t actually see her much at the house as we and she were our most of the time but she was friendly when we did."
15579249,135372971,2017-03-04,8250954,Min,"Maria's house is stunning.  A true holiday house - spacious, beautiful and homely.  The bottle of wine and breakfast supplies were a generous supply.  Outdoor dining looking over some vines was stunning in the warm evenings.  We were there to cycle the Barossa trail and the house was well positioned for us to achieve that.  Many thoughtful touches to the house including magazines and kids toys.  Highly recommended."

15579249,235203115,2018-02-15,24060304,Andrew,A really wonderful country location with great bird life. Quiet but so close to so many great wineries and restaurants. The house has been modernised to a high standard and was spotlessly clean. The welcome pack was very comprehensive and saved us doing any food shopping. An unexpected bonus was a visit from a family of kangaroos on our second evening.
15579249,236925599,2018-02-20,168822819,David,"Great place, well located, fantastic outdoor eating area and vineyard gave a truly Tuscan feel to the place. Many interesting and novel touches and more food provided than we could eat. Well done, nothing could be faulted and highly recommended."
15579249,243402215,2018-03-15,22293108,Kate,"We stayed at Casa Rosa for three nights. It was wonderful. The location is close to the town, but private, with a lovely outdoor dining area, over looking a vineyard. The bird life was magnificent and kangaroos visited the garden. We found the house exceptionally well equipped with beautiful high quality crockery and cooking equipment. There was a very generous welcome pack. The bedrooms were very comfortable with good quality linen, the bathrooms had great walk in showers and nice toiletries. We watched films together in the evening on the comfy sofa.  We would love to return for a longer stay. Highly recommended, you could not fail to enjoy this lovely house."

15579249,257629414,2018-04-27,179315206,Thomas,"Fabulous home in the Barossa. 

We loved everything about this Airbnb stay. Thoughtful provisions were left for our arrival, including bread and spreads, milk, OJ, snacks, and sparkling wine ready to chill. The house is tastefully renovated and well maintained, and appointed to a high standard throughout. We loved the many “extras” available including toys for the kids, board games, the vinyl record collection and turntable and the open log fire. We slept well in the comfy beds.  

The house is located in a secluded location with its own small vineyard. Our only disappointment was that we couldn’t stay for longer!"

15579249,288473960,2018-07-10,38311823,Shaun,"An Absolute 10/10 
A very large well appointed home, beautifully furnished and great personal touches.  We greatly appreciated the trouble the hosts had gone to with a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us on the kithcen bench, if that wasnt enough there was also an ample carafe of port to enjoy whilst relaxing next to the fire place after a long day exploring the Barossa.  Fully ducted air con kept the place warm and cozy.  Wonderful rural position,secluded and peaceful yet close to shops at Lyndoch and easy access to wineries.  The outdoor area is amazing  youd swear you're  in Italy, surrounded by vineyards and great views over the Barossa  Plenty of stocks for brekkie and a little treat for those with a sweet tooth was much appreciated.  Maria is a wonderful host and has local managers to assist with anything you need, they were great to deal with and prompt with their replies.   Will definitely be back, thank you Maria we had an amazing stay."

15579249,350938514,2018-11-21,10292408,Stephen,"A very memorable first trip to the Barossa Valley!!
We visited the Barossa Valley with another couple.  We were all first time travelers to the Barossa and did we ever luck out when we chose Maria's place.  It was the first time I've booked an Airbnb where the pictures and description did not do justice to what we experienced.  To create that perfect first impression, Maria had left us a beautiful ""welcome basket"".  The location was perfect.  We could drive to anywhere in the Barossa and Eden Valleys in 20-25 minutes or less.  We hiked in the mornings at nearby conservation areas, toured several top notch wineries in the afternoons, and BBQ'd and ate 'al fresco' on the terrace while watching the sunsets in the evenings.  Our wives had a very relaxing and enjoyable experience at a Spa in nearby Gawler as well.  One evening we even had some kangaroos visit us right in the backyard!  An enthusiastic two thumbs up from all four of us!"
15579249,354149633,2018-11-30,21713454,Amanda,"Casa Rossa was the perfect Barossa base for our party of 2 couples. 

Stylish, comfortable and really well equipped with more bacon, eggs, juice etc in the breakfast pack than we could possibly eat in 4 days! 

Lovely, quiet, cosy, elegant home that we would love to return to and 100% recommend to anyone looking for a perfect, central but private base for a wonderful Barossa experience."
15579249,422749857,2019-03-11,71604510,Susan,"Great house, very clean, lovely towels and linen, nice little touches like wine and breakfast provisions. You do need a car but shops and wineries all within a short drive. We loved the peace and quiet!"

The breakfast provisions were a lovely touch!"
15579249,488349883,2019-07-15,174854136,Georgina,"We had a fantastic time staying at Casa Rossa, loved the location and the house. So close to a lot of the wineries and beautiful scenery. Especially loved the morning and evening visits of the wallabies."

15579249,536494541,2019-09-26,121770944,Lynne,"Casa Rossa is a fantastic place.  It is situated in the heart of the Barossa so you can base yourself there and plan wonderful day trips to many of the wonderful little towns & vineyards throughout the Barossa Valley.  The house was spotlessly clean, the breakfast supplies plentiful, the beds extremely comfortable.  As it was still cool at night, we made a beautiful open fire which was the perfect way to relax with the wonderful wines we purchased.  Equally as nice on a warmer evening would be to sit outside taking in the vines & view, peace & quiet of the Casa Rossa surrounds.  I would totally recommend staying at Casa Rossa, it was a wonderful way to start off a few days R&R."

Lots of space for the kids to play outside as well as some toys and books inside, which were a big hit with our toddler.

Bedrooms are comfortable and kitchen is well-equipped. Nice vineyard a step from front door. Beautiful view of the valley. It’s a little bit noisy in the main bedroom while the air con was on. And The hot water tank is a bit small, had to wait for hot water overnight. Overall, it’s a great place to stay with couple of friends. Would go again."
15579249,658094113,2020-08-30,9358902,Bianca,"Casa Rossa is a perfect base for a Barossa short or long stay. It would make a great retreat for a couple, family or even group with it’s three bedrooms, two lounge areas, large dining table and delightful kitchen space. The records were an absolute treat. The entire space was modern and stylish but with beautiful character driven and historical touches that added a lovely sense of charm. We woke up to a kangaroo with a Joey in it’s pouch outside our bedroom window the first morning there and had lovely kangaroo visitors through the vines in the afternoons as well. The fire was a perfect space for a cosy evening after a brilliant day of vineyard touring and tasting. The breakfast provisions were substantial and the extra gift of wine and chocolate added such a thoughtful touch. It was a comforting enough to feel like a home away from home, but well thought out enough to feel like a wonderful holiday. We highly recommend this property and the swift and friendly communication of Maria. My daughter was thrilled to find the toys in her room and I was thrilled to find the coffee pods! Enjoy your stay in a lovely Lyndoch gem"

Its a great location to spend your week in the Barossa at as it is conveniently located near some of the best wineries. The space is large with plenty of break out areas and would work best for groups of 4-6. 

I would highly recommend Maria's place for people that are looking to stay in the Barossa."
15670050,141006345,2017-04-01,122165366,Linda,"We had such a wonderful stay in April. A beautiful home in a fantastic location. The attention to detail was shown throughout the house, from the decor and little luxuries scattered around the house to the Netflix and apple tv access. 

The kitchen is fully stocked, making the breakfast cook up a breeze. Oh, and the breakfast provisions, what a bounty! 

With fantastic restaurants and cafes at our doorstep it was everything we could have asked for and more from a weekend in the Barossa. 

We look forward to staying again, thanks from the Carraghers and the Nunans

I visited Tanunda with a group of girlfriends to celebrate my 30th birthday and Andy and Natalie went above and beyond to make our trip unforgettable. 
We arrived to welcome champagne, a birthday cake, balloons and a card. There was the most amazing breakfast spread on offer - some of Barossa's finest produce - as well as toiletries and other amenities.
The house itself was big and beautiful The decor was trendy and we felt so at home, immediately. It was a great space to spend a girls weekend away!
There were two big bathrooms which made getting ready quite easy. (Even for 8 females!)
I also should mention the beautiful outdoor area where we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunshine. 
Location wise it is 10/10. We walked to the supermarket and some wine bars. We hired bikes and cycled from the house to many wineries around Tanunda as well. 
I would definitely stay at Bilyara house again and I would 100% recommend it to other guests.

Facilities were great, breakfast supplies were overly generous, and location was best by far.  Could not recommend enough."
15670050,723143638,2021-01-09,317924555,Iain,"This is an absolute gem. The house is very comfortable and stylish, equipped for a short or long stay. We felt so at home there and didn't want to leave!

15811271,261125479,2018-05-06,66874207,Steve,"Anthea and Stefan were fantastic hosts. We felt like we were staying with old friends due to the warm correspondence beforehand and how we were greeted upon arrival. The space was clean, well lit, and quite private, with the ability to interact with the hosts in the shared space if you wish or keep to yourselves. We chose to enjoy a wine and a chat in the evening when we arrived back from our winery visit. This location is great value for a person or couple enjoying the Barossa and surrounds."
15811271,262713462,2018-05-09,188233921,Merlinda,"I would highly recommend staying at this property it has a unique decor and I love the fact you can also take an art class with Anthea. Anthea and Stefan were very welcoming on arrival and their fur family were just gorgeous. Anthea also shared some great walks to do around Angaston of which I went on one after I checked out and loved every minute. It is a quiet, clean and cozy place to stay."
15811271,269730269,2018-05-27,141236902,Christopher,"Anthea and Stefan are a couple of natural hosts who make you feel welcome and at ease very quickly. Our bed was very comfy and even had electric blankets for those chilly autumn nights. Even without that, the fire was going 24/7 to keep the whole house warm. We enjoyed the company of Merry (small dog). The 2 cats kept their distance, sadly for us. The house has Anthea's art work everywhere, which is just lovely and certainly adds a special touch to the house. Both of our hosts were accommodating, helpful and natural. We would highly recommend. The house is close enough for a stroll down town for a meal out, although the driveway is quite steep. Not for the faint hearted, but great exercise. Special little touches included a packet of local dried fruit blend and a bottle of red wine, should you choose to indulge. "

Pets and a few steps are within the home. The driveway is steep, but manageable. We found Anthea to be very warm, friendly and helpful. Check in was no problem. The bed was comfortable. There was a separate sitting room,  bedroom,  toilet and bathroom for guest use only. Didn't have to share anything, which we were very pleased about. Everything was very clean and neat. Anthea is an artist and has many pieces of her work on show. Very interesting.
Thank you for a very   pleasant stay Anthea."

Anthea and Steffen were really friendly and really heart warming people. We also had dinner with them and it was a nice evening with really good talks. Also their dog and the two cats were cute. We can definitely recommend this place. Anthea also gave us good tipps and spots what to do in Barossa Valley. She organised for us our wine tasting tour. 

All in all we had two wonderful nights in the Art Gallery Box with two wonderful people. Thanks Anthea and Steffen. :-)

Heaters and an electric blanket disguised the fact that it was soooo cold outside and a couple of welcome gifts greeted us.

Be prepared for a very steep driveway, but you don't have to walk up, as there is a parking space at the top. Inside there are also a few steps, but very safe.

It's plain to see why Anthea and Stefan are Superhosts!"

The spectacular 25 acre property not only boasts absolute privacy but is surrounded by beautiful rose gardens, a chicken coupe, sheep paddock and green lawns. 

Inside will make you feel right at home with warm and welcoming furnishings, comfy beds and well pressured showers. The home was immaculately clean and tidy, a well fitted kitchen with views outside made cooking a meal for my friends and family more than enjoyable.

It was so peaceful and serene and the views and garden are even more special than the photos indicate. You could easily relax and unwind at the house all day, with a bottle of wine and some nibbles. The beds were super comfortable and the layout of the house is great for hosting 2 or 3 couples or group of friends/family.  Fresh eggs, brekky stuff and a lovely bottle of wine were a nice touch.

16055904,336068445,2018-10-13,134830828,Miranda,"This is an absolutely idyllic location - you can sit out on the back verandah for hours and hours, on comfy sofas sipping the Barossa wine you’ve just bought, looking out over Matilda’s perfectly kept and just beautiful garden, over to Tanunda, its rooftops and church spires (and later, its twinkling lights) and to the hills beyond. Just magic. Our boys also loved exploring the extensive bush garden on the property. Plus there’s a very comfortable house to enjoy with everything you might need and lots of space for a family of 4 to find their own areas to retreat to when they need. It was the perfect base for this Barossa weekend away with children. I hope we’ll be back!"

The house was clean, tidy and had everything we needed. Matilda and Daniel had organised some thoughtful touches like breakfast provisions, local wine and some toiletries. That was very unexpected and greatly appreciated!
We cooked breakfast each morning and a few dinners during our stay. The kitchen was well appointed and there was also an outdoor BBQ we used.
Their house was very homely and comfortable to stay in. The back garden and view was gorgeous!
We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend Matilda and Daniel’s house."

For those seeking a nice rural view proximate to the township of Tanunda with its tourist activities, shopping and restaurants,  you can do no better.

Easy to book, communicate and check in, Matilda made us feel really welcome as soon as we walked in the door, a sign 'Welcome Nuno and Friends, we hope you enjoy your stay', along side a bottle of red wine welcomed us. We were even treated with supplies of fresh eggs, milk and bread for breakfast. The house is immaculately clean and fitted out with everything you would have in your own home. There is a beautiful fireplace, piano, magazines, kids toys and a great range of books and dvds to enjoy! There is this amazing glass room off the main bedroom with a bathtub overlooking the manicured rose garden and rolling green Barossa Hills. A must book for anyone looking to stay in the Barossa Valley. Thank you for sharing your home with us Matilda :)"

We are 2 couples and felt completely at home. The views from inside the house and the outside entertaining area are magnificent. 
The house was so clean and comfortable with quality furnishings and amenities. 
Great additional comforts like the Nespresso machine with pods, bacon, eggs and bread for our breakfasts were so welcomed. 
Would be delighted  to stay here again as the house is very convenient to everything in the Barossa Valley region but is on a private secluded block."

It has loads of character and is a really easy and convenient and value for money place to stay.
It was also wonderful having the completely flat access from the car to the house.
And we made us of the covered outdoor area and BBQ.
We would definitely stay in this wonderful character cottage again."

The cottage was right in the middle of town but very secluded. It was easy walking distance to cafes, shops, nice restaurants, etc. 
We were helped immediately when we locked ourselves out...and we hadn't even had any wine yet. 
The fireplace was great and there was firewood,  kindling, and firestarters provided. The fireplace was a major bonus to sit back and have a fire with a nice shiraz. 
Breakfast was provided. The bacon was fresh from the butcher and the eggs were delicious. We made our own brekkie easily with the ingredients and pots, panda, and utensils provided.
Thanks very much for a great stay.
Sarah and Daniel"

We stayed in the cottage for three nights and wished we were staying longer.  It was very close to hotels and restaurants but situated in a quiet position.  The breakfast provisions were amazing as were some little extra treats left for us.  The kitchen and bathroom have been moderised while the sitting room and bedrooms retain an old worlds charm. Amanda was very prompt in answering text messages we sent to her.  If we are ever back in the Barossa we hope that Elsie's Cottage is available for our accommodation.

The location is ideal with the cottage being within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops and a newly opened wine bar.  For those who don't mind a 1.3km walk, it's even within walking distance of a micro brewery!  The breakfast supplies were great but the special treats (home make biscuits, chocolates etc) were even better.  These certainly helped with the late night munchies and were really appreciated.  The cottage was very homely and comfortable.  I would certainly stay there again if I was visiting the Barossa."

16595832,149985853,2017-05-06,52967313,Matthew,"Our stay here was absolutely amazing. We were in Adelaide for a wedding and we were a group of 9. The house easily accommodated us with plenty of beds and space. There were plenty of amenities to keep us all entertained and help to get us ready for our wedding. 

On top of the beautiful, clean and modern home. Annelise and Lee provided us with the best service, comparable to that you would find at a 5-star hotel. Some lovely and thoughtful surprises on arrival. I'll keep them a surprise so when others come and visit they can experience what we did. Lee and Annelise also provided transport from the home to our venue which greatly helped as it made our stay even smoother without the stress of having to organise transport. 

Overall the house was already amazing on it's own but the service provided made our stay that much more memorable and allowed us to relax, we really felt that we were taken care of.  Several of our team commented that it was ""the best air bnb that they've been in"" 

100% recommend this for bigger groups looking for a relaxing getaway in a beautiful part of the world or for families. We will all return in our own time definitely!"
16595832,159907720,2017-06-12,85210674,Lauren,Annelise's house is beautiful. So many added extras such as the spa and games cupboard. The surprise treats upon arrival were a lovely added touch. Highly recommend!

Any issues (not that there was any), or information we needed, we were able to contact her with almost instant replies. The house was beautiful and accommodated a family of 5 (with three young adults) excellently. The complimentary wines, gourmet food platter and even an extra night made this trip the perfect getaway for our otherwise always  busy family. Would definitely return and recommend to all others. Well worth it! So thank you Annelise "

The most amazing house for 9 adults and 2 children to stay. The family's from
Overseas said they had never seen a house that big and beautiful before. Everything we needed and was there waiting for us. The kids loved their little gift and us adults loved our wine and cheese platter. We will definitely return, hopefully when it's not raining and don't chicken out using the jacuzzi.
Thanks again 10/10"
16595832,183671026,2017-08-18,4863855,Hiro,"It was just a great decision to stay at Annelise's beautiful home with my two other colleagues instead of staying at a hotel. Everything about it was great, from her prompt communication to handing us the key where we were for a business meeting to finding a nice cheese plate and local goodies like bacon and eggs and artisanal butter, etc. for us to enjoy! It was a most stunning Airbnb experience, obviously the best ever for me so far! I would love to come back and definitely with more friends for more than one night."
16595832,184488697,2017-08-19,21302286,Elizabeth,"Perfect house for a great weekend away - we had eight girls and a baby and had all the space and amenities we needed and then some.

The house was a perfect base, tucked away in a new development in Lyndoch. Lee met us when we checked in and gave us a tour around the house. The fridge was stocked with local produce for breakfast as as well a having a continental selection on the breakfast bar. After a busy day, we all enjoyed a soak in the hot tub.
This place would be ideal for families with kids as their are plenty of fun games to play in the backyard, such as table tennis and air hockey.
Thanks Annelise, we'd definitely stay again!"

Easy to find and although it is in the quiet town of Lyndoch, it is a short drive from nearby cafes and wineries and other areas like Tanunda and Gawler.

Annelise was a great host, continually offering value adds and lots of information which helped make our stay easy and enjoyable.

16595832,544774222,2019-10-11,822670,James,"Perfectly located for exploring the Barossa Valley, and plenty of space: there were only three of us staying but I could imagine ten people staying here very comfortably. Highly recommended."
16595832,552099900,2019-10-21,39385609,James,"What a wonderful find in the Barossa if you’re coming with kids! The place was spacious and immaculately clean. But there are so many amazing touches that we weren’t expecting that made this place so kid friendly for travellers with kids up to 3 in particular. Lots of toys, games and child supplies made this a perfect place for us with our 18 month old. Very much as described and made for a wonderful stay. Minutes from many wineries, it’s in a great location. Thanks for a great stay!"
16595832,559386133,2019-11-03,26332649,Nicholas,"Wonderfully appointed, spacious home. Huge kitchen and great location for a Barossa getaway!  Loved the hot tub under the stars, Grant Burge Bubbles and breakfast goodies! Awesome!"

Annelise is a great host and was very helpful."
16595832,561726416,2019-11-10,268892642,Emma,House was great in size with lots of bedding options to keep everybody comfortable when traveling in a large group. Annelise is a very thoughtful and responsive host.
16595832,564497778,2019-11-16,43055032,Rhiannon,"Great space and fabulous for a family. So many toys for the young ones and games; arcade and board style for the not so young ones. The gym equipment was a fabulous point of difference as well. Completely enclosed backyard, so again made it easy with an infant. Good quality highchair and cot were supplied as well, which made even the travel easier. We didn't drive further than 30 mins (except a trip to Adelaide), and there were heaps of cute villages and wineries to visit. Great butcher in Lyndoch. Food shopping very close, though on the slim side. We had one of the best massages we've had in a while as well, from a woman in Lyndoch whose business card we found amongst the many recommendations Annelise left for us. 
Communication with Annelise was lightening fast and thorough. Check in, a breeze."
16595832,567214121,2019-11-22,29614087,Kate,Absolutely superb house within easy distance of all the wineries with so many thoughtful amenities. If we are ever lucky enough to visit the Barossa we would definitely stay there again.
16595832,578502800,2019-12-17,15411036,Rowan,"Annelise's place in Lyndoch is lovely.

Kitchen is really well equipped and beds v comfortable, place was also v clean.  Thanks heaps for your hospitality!"

The home had everything you could ask for including many small stand out touches like an honesty cupboard with supplies, a kids play room, and we'll stocked pantry/fridge for guests to feel at home from the moment they arrive.

Thanks Annelise!"

16693931,128997716,2017-01-28,5631849,Cameron & Angie,"Go-go's was perfect for our stay in Eden Valley. It was much more spacious than we expected, and lovely evenings were spent in the cool breezes on the front verandah after long days exploring and wine tasting. It had everything we needed and the general store and pub were just down the road. It was super quiet, perfect for star gazing at night, and was wonderful to wake up to the sunrise and birds in the morning. Karine and Michael were great hosts and we'll definitely be back again. Thank you!"
16693931,136031269,2017-03-07,61327287,Ian,"Fantastic, comfortable and homely place to stay in Eden Valley, close to Barossa region. Clean, tidy and spacious. Lovely to sit on front verandah and listen to the birds. Especially loved how well equipped it was, even with supplies in the fridge and pantry, which was great as interstate travellers. Recommended"
16693931,136995201,2017-03-12,113435339,Susan,"My husband and our two friends just spent 4 nights in this fantastic accomodation. Everything was perfect from the spacious clean house to the host ""Karines' most knowledgable and local tips. Thank you. We can't wait to come back again as soon as possible. "
16693931,144896767,2017-04-16,121452039,Linna,"The property is set on a reasonably quiet road, located near some nice wineries a short (5 - 30 minute) drive away. The rooms are clean and spacious and looked better than they did in the photos. The kitchen was well equipped, including a stocked pantry with all the basics. The single bathroom and separate toilet worked out alright for four adults. The host was very friendly and helpful (and also environmentally conscious, which was a bonus).  Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and would consider staying there again. A few things that did not really bother us but may be worth noting for some guests are (i) there is no internet access and we had Optus network on our mobiles. The mobile connection dropped in and out a fair bit during our stay. Not sure if other networks would be better in the area. We had a GPS and did most of our research before the trip so it did not bother us; (ii) the house was very clean but perhaps given the season (autumn) we found a number of caterpillar-looking worms inside the house. We were not bothered but just had to watch where we put our steps when walking around the house; (iii) the TV signal was very weak on two of the three nights, with only one channel working. Again we were not bothered as we did not go to Eden Valley to watch TV but if you would like to stay in one night and put a show on for the kids then it would be tricky as there is no internet or DVD player. Overall it was a lovely stay at Go Go. Thank you Karine."
16693931,147456050,2017-04-26,116329651,Rob,A great retreat.  We loved the space for kids to play and a sense of being away from the business of life.
16693931,161424912,2017-06-18,3852768,Wilmie,"Go Go's was great, we had absolutely everything we needed and more. Excellent location - we were so happy we picked Eden Valley to stay and even happier with Go Go's. It was right in the middle of so many great wineries and other places to visit and really comfortable and well set up for relaxing after a busy day of sight seeing. "
16693931,162668004,2017-06-22,135424489,Amy,Thanks for having us! 
16693931,194425720,2017-09-17,143877236,Rebecca,A great place to stay. clean and tidy with room to move inside and out. The fresh baked bread waiting for us on arrival was a nice touch.

Enjoyed by all of us. Very Clean abode. The 2 dogs loved every minute of the wonderful gardens. Hosts supplied fire wood so we could enjoy an open fire under the stars brillant"
16693931,205308587,2017-10-22,54288921,James,"Set in the picturesque Eden Valley, Go's Go's is a great base to explore the Barossa Valley. The house is extremely spacious and has all the amenities, including a fully stocked pantry, for a no hassle stay. Host Karine is extremely helpful and prompt with responses to questions/requests. Overall, very good value."
16693931,209248895,2017-11-05,37354186,Justin,The house was excellent and very clean. Karine was very friendly and hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Karine!

16693931,212699346,2017-11-19,135338006,Ron,"Although we only spent two night's at Go Go's we were very impressed with the location and amenities, The rooms were spacious and tidy. The surrounds were well kept and it was pleasing to wake up to the sounds of country wildlife. The atmosphere was typical of Peace and Tranquility and very relaxing. The location  is within close reach of many wineries and the larger towns of the Barossa Valley. The hosts are a young couple who were very keen to please and ensure and ensure our stay was an enjoyable one. Thanks to Michael and Karine."
16693931,221241503,2017-12-26,158506485,Chris,"A fantastic place to stay. The house is clean and spacious with plenty of natural light through large windows. The rooms are large which is an added bonus when 2 toddlers are in tow and is well stocked from a pantry/amenities perspective. Set on a sizeable piece of land, there is plenty of space for outside play. The birdlife in the early morning and late of an evening was just wonderful to hear. While Eden Valley doesn't have a general store, this is easily countered by some forward planning. All in all, thoroughly recommended - a wonderful few days were spent here."
16693931,221817578,2017-12-27,103252146,Divya,Karine was an amazing host. The house was beautifully presented with a lovely backyard and all amenities also extremely clean. Could not ask for more.
16693931,224346517,2018-01-02,1123245,Dasha,"The place was great, very well equipped, we had everything we needed and more ( we were traveling with two young boys and grandma). It was clean, communication was great, we were welcomed with all basic groceries like bread, eggs and great wine :-) as we arrived late. Great location - lot to see around or in Adelaide and Glenelg village. Stay at least 3 nights to experience it all and visit some vineyards too :-)."
16693931,240486513,2018-03-04,138805060,Bernadette,"It was exactly what we were looking for. The friendly touch like a fresh loaf of bread, flowers and a well stocked pantry were certainly very much appreciated. The location was just perfect for us, a place surrounded by nature and beautiful birds."
16693931,249820425,2018-04-03,82615296,Terence,"Located in a very peaceful place with heaps of space inside and out, a very comfortable and spacious  house in which you feel at home. A very clean and tidy place with everything needed at hand."
16693931,257916041,2018-04-28,16224405,Mark,"We had a lovely couple of nights at Karine's place with my parents and our two kids. It was easy to check in and the communications prior with Karine were quick and accurate. 

The place itself is located well, short drive to Fernfield Winery and easy reach to Henschke and the heart of the Barossa only a scenic drive of 15/20min away.

The house was clean and surprisingly well stocked pantry. We cooked at home for a night and whilst the place is of a certain age, everything works well including the heating and hot water in the shower.

Karine has done a great job putting some nice personal touches throughout the house and the real party piece is the garden, which is fantastic to just look out over and have the kids run around to chase the morning rabbits.

Thank you for letting us stay."
16693931,360001560,2018-12-19,40926607,Lester,"This home is a very stylish and well-organised. Karine did a wonderful job as the host and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible.

Good location close to the wineries, and a very specious garden where the kids can enjoy themselves for ages. We liked it that everything we needed in the house was there. Super convenient. Karine was very quick and helpful in her communication."
16693931,440444169,2019-04-21,46223526,Petar,"We had a lovely stay at Karine’s house with our two young children. They played so much in the huge yard, and we even saw a rabbit crossing the garden on Easter morning! There was a swing outside and so many toys and books inside, so they were happily occupied all the time. The house is in a great location, close to beautiful Angaston and to so many lovely wineries. It had everything we needed and much more; Karine had kindly left some home made bread, Easter chocolate eggs for the kids, as well as a very well stocked pantry. We are so grateful for her hospitality and would love to be back to Eden valley for longer one day!"

Thank you for the delicious loaf of bread too!!"
16693931,582943273,2019-12-27,234599313,Jessica,"Go Go's was such an amazing place to stay!! Karine made sure we were alert, safe and looked after during the horrible fires in the Adelaide Hills even welcoming our family members who's properties had been affected by the fires to stay with us as they could not go home. Karine is an incredibly thoughtful person and we feel so lucky to have been able to stay in her property, everything you could imagine needing was already in the house from toys, extra bedding (which definitely came in handy), to a stocked pantry and even and emergency kit. If you ever get the chance to stay here I recommend you do it as soon as possible. You will not regret it!"
16693931,665552243,2020-09-18,9395883,Claire,"We stayed there for 3 nights with our 2 young children and we had the best time. There were fresh bread and eggs when we arrived and the house was spotless. Plenty of toys the kids would play with. The house had everything we needed and the garden had everything to entertain the kids. The region is so beautiful, lots of things to do and visit for the kids and adults! Great and relaxing stay. Thanks Karine for the hospitality, we will be back!"

16693931,718989543,2020-12-28,48841864,Richard,It was a 'home away from home'. All the things you expect to find at home are there. Plenty of space inside and out. Also thrilled to find a loaf of freshly baked break from Karine on arrival. That was delicious and so thoughtful.

16795559,135395249,2017-03-04,113341642,Leah,"The cottage at Buckbury End farm is situated on a picturesque property. Beautiful country breezes, an outlook of peppercorn trees and gums and a gorgeously appointed cottage await. If you are looking for a quiet, relaxing, romantic escape then Buckbury end is your destination. Every detail has been attended from fresh cut flowers to the gourmet farm breakfast products and natural Australian bath products. We can't recommend this place enough!"

16795559,136634015,2017-03-11,450379,Tim,Great secluded location which offers all the amenities of Tanunda (10 min drive away). The cottage has everything you need and the inclusion of a surprise breakfast in the fridge was unexpected but totally appreciated. Would stay here again and again!

The cottage is lovely - has everything you need and really sets the scene for some excellent R&R! A perfect getaway for those wanting to be surrounded by nature and not too far from wineries and attractions! 
16795559,137859785,2017-03-17,11668133,Julie,"John's place had absolutely everything you could want. We even saw a kangaroo close by while we had our breakfast - a must for overseas visitors.

16795559,138075399,2017-03-18,115721708,Carmel,"Located on a farm, but still very handy to all the scenic and tourist attractions of the Barossa. A lot of love and care has gone into restoring an authentic slice of Barossa architecture. Gives you the opportunity to experience a stone cottage but with all the mod-cons. Fabulous!"
16795559,138851878,2017-03-21,28088758,Julie,"Wow if you want country - you have it here!  Location just a little out of town but very easy to find when you follow the instructions given by John.  Ample food for breakfast, bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, bread, yogurt, fruit, juice and all the condiments necessary.  The very new and modern kitchen is equipped with all the mod cons.  Top quality cookware, crockery etc...  This farm cottage has been decked out with exceptional detail...lovely linen too.

We arrived and I was reading when husband went out to explore, next thing I recive a phone call from my husband to come and join him. I find him with John (our Host) and there they were beers in hand having a right old talk, I was then handed a drink myself.  Now that is what I call a host and country hospitality.  John is in the process of renovating the main farmhouse - an enormous job - we look forward to coming back in 5 years ? 10 perhaps? :) Great stay...thank you"
16795559,139329673,2017-03-24,7727030,Alison,"John was the perfect host, very prompt in responding and giving directions. The cottage is comfy and lots of mod cons. A great setting for close access to the Barossa Valley."
16795559,139902636,2017-03-26,1111388,Hui Min,Truly a gem. A great place to come back to after trekking the Barossa. A home away from home ... Thank you for an unforgettable experience

16795559,143647110,2017-04-12,101860244,Joanne,"We had a wonderful stay at Buckbury end farm - quiet, lovely views and walks. John provided lots of information ahead of time, the fridge was well stocked with eggs, bacon, sausages, etc for breakfast, and John's dad dropped by after a couple of days to see if there was anything we needed.  Wonderful place to get away from it all."
16795559,144133763,2017-04-14,43734378,Michael,"Book this place now. It has everything you could want for an escape to the Barossa. Quiet, clean, beautiful property, and extra little touches that make it just magic. Thanks John."

Newly renovated and attention to detail with comforts like a fridge of essentials as well as breakfast essentials, bathroom essentials and the lovely crisp and clean bedding. So close to town and all the wineries you can imagine and in a quiet, country location this is the perfect getaway accommodation! We will absolutely stay here again. John was organised and communicated quickly. He was very generous and gracious and we felt totally at ease. I would highly recommend this stay to anyone visiting the Barossa. We loved our stay thank you John!"

My husband and I stayed there for 3 days for our anniversary and we would definitely stay there again. The bed is very comfortable, the shower is nice, the kitchen has everything you could need. There is a TV, however there is no Wi-Fi. John has left little treats everywhere - breakfast, chocolates, magazines, toiletries, BBQ, etc. The location is great - close to all the wineries but far enough for peace and quiet. There's even a stream you can walk to on the property."
16795559,150049187,2017-05-07,122991474,Kath,John is a great host and the cottage provides every comfort needed while on a trip.  Attention to detail in providing a well equipped kitchen and bathroom was really appreciated - and the quality of bath/bed linen was a wonderful bonus.  Thanks for providing such a gorgeous cottage getaway.  A close drive to Tanunda (15-20 mins) with plenty of wineries and a scenic countryside drive - and so quiet at night.  Thanks John.  It was wonderful!
16795559,150726771,2017-05-09,120266473,Svenja,"This place is a recommendation for everyone who enjoys staying in a romantic and cozy cottage in a secluded area with a lovely country side. Take a walk to the nearby river, enjoy the peacefulness of the area or drive to Tanunda in 15-20min. It has all the nice touches and essentials for a wonderful stay. Everything is spotlessly clean. Thanks again John. You have done a great job."
16795559,151453347,2017-05-12,37111252,Greg,"This place is fantastic. Take it from an Adelaide local... If you're travelling in the Barossa Valley, this is the spot where you want to be staying. Only a short drive away from wherever your Barossa adventures happen to take you. Gorgeous setting, great host. Next time we'll look to stay longer and have a beer with you!"
16795559,151683573,2017-05-14,59444979,Catherine & Naomi,"What a gem!
This cottage was so peaceful, tranquil and beautifully located. Set in the rolling Barossa Hills in a tucked away part of the world, we felt miles from civilisation. 
The cottage was tastefully renovated and decorated with quality linen and kitchen supplies. We had everything we needed. 
Thanks John, what a fantastic job you've done! See you again! "
16795559,153851291,2017-05-22,632928,Chuck,"This place is extremely close to everything in the Barossa, but very secluded. Charming home, very private, and more views and birds than we ever expected.

Highly recommend this cottage and we will be back ourselves!"
16795559,189497387,2017-09-02,56558193,Marie-Therese,"A lovely, cosy & refreshing place. Old stone cottage, juxtaposed with very new fit outs that make it comfortable, interesting and relaxing.

Would definitely stay here again. Thanks much John."

Very tastfully done utilising the old stone cottage highlights with modern very clean facilities.  Everything for a relaxing quiet getaway.  Access to the creek and picnic spot is exceptional in the afternoon for a glass of wine and a beer in glorious country solitude.  The cottage is close to all the Barossa Valley attractions and takes no time at all to get to the wineries and local shops.  We cant recommend John's cottage highly enough!!  Well done.

16795559,212432722,2017-11-17,116640427,Abigail,"A well appointed cute little cottage, on a super quiet and peaceful block of land. John's done a wonderful job of setting up this little getaway to feel like a home away from home. It's gorgeous on a nice day, and super cosy and comfy in bad weather. We were totally left to enjoy the space in peace, and appreciated the generous fridge contents and personal touches of the property. John was a great communicator and kept us apprised of a road closure that was to occur during our stay meaning we could plan around it and make the most of our time. We will be recommending it to others. Thanks again!"
16795559,212653677,2017-11-18,106069151,Michael,Perfect accommodation for attending a function in south Barossa. Rustic and quaint but also everything we needed. Little details taken care of... and we love the breakfast supplies!
16795559,214403982,2017-11-25,10963073,Kate,John's farmer's cottage is a pleasant and comfortable place to stay. We stayed after attending a wedding in the Barossa. It was located in an convenient location (although accessed via dirt roads) and was a good choice for us for an overnight stay.

The property itself was so lovely and peaceful. My husband and I enjoyed a walk down to the creek and wildlife spotting. We would have loved to go down there for a picnic with the provided bag, but it was 42 degrees so we stayed in! John’s communication was super efficient too. He was always so fast to respond to my questions, and was able to facilitate us arriving early, with the air conditioning on waiting for us!
The property feels very remote, but is actually only 15-20 minutes from major Barossa towns. We were able to have a winery tour pick us up from there and also a taxi driver drop us off with no problems at all. 
An amazing stay overall! Thanks so much John!"

We loved the place, it was so clean, had loads of original features but also felt luxury. John is a top host and went out of his way to accommodate us! We loved the location as it felt remote, but was only an hour to Adelaide and a couple of minutes from some great Barossa winery’s. I’d recommend booking a winery tour through Getaway tours as you can be collected from the gate. We’ll be back and I’d highly recommend the cottage to others looking for an awesome weekend away."

16795559,315062394,2018-08-28,47429019,Jesse,Really enjoyed our stay. Was a little disappointed to have to provide our own firewood for the fireplace (and only found this out on the morning of check in) but aside from that we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend.
16795559,316246237,2018-08-31,94699866,Megan,"I really do not want to do this because I believe it is  a wonderful secret of the Barossa and I do not want to share...but to be fare this is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had...and I have used Airbnb quite a lot in the past few years. 
The cottage is set back from Johns property and is very private with a lovely out look onto a garden and the farm its self. The attention to special details is amazing and the cottage has absolutely every thing you could possibly need to make your stay completely self sufficient. It is close to many wineries and Tanunda. 
I have no hesitation in recommending this property for couples who need a getaway from their busy lives. 
Thanks so much John for making us feel very welcome"

16795559,333141798,2018-10-07,156015689,Kathryn,"We stayed at this beautiful little cottage for our anniversary weekend and it was perfect. John was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and even let us have a late check out as there was no one staying immediately after us. It was a great location, very quiet and secluded but still easy to get where we needed to go around the Barossa. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a couple of nights away!"

Rustic with all the mod cons, very comfy,  very clean  and the  most generous provisions  EVER!!  The flowers  were lovely and the  attention to detail was amazing,  everything was  thought of. The views outside are spectacular especially in the mornings and when the sun is setting. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and wandering down to the creek for  drinks and picnics. We loved seeing the animals and sharing our apples with the horse and pony. The roads around the property and in the area have gorgeous vineyards and olive groves to feast your eyes on as well.   John is very friendly and  available if you need anything but also very discreet, leaving you to  your privacy. Tips: Chateau Barossa's garden was really nice and their leek and chicken pie with mash was delish! Seven hills winery and tour in Clare Valley is really worth a visit on a sunny day as is the Lavender farm. The drive there from Lydoch is gorgeous and going to Parson's lookout on Trial rd as you turn right from the Lavender farm, not to be missed. Mintaro is very cute and charming  (and small) if you like old English type villages.  The ""Co Op: shop is amazing. We were drooling over all the cheese! We loved our time in the Barossa and the accommodation was an absolute delight and hightlight. We will come again! Thank you John :))"

16795559,346003334,2018-11-07,14729834,Lincoln,"If you’re considering staying here then do not hesitate. We have no improvements to suggest! We stayed here with our five month old daughter for three nights and loved every minute. The cottage is lovely and warm, quiet and peaceful. It is kitted out really well with everything you need. It was spotlessly clean. We appreciated greatly that the fridge had been stocked with breakfast and loved that there was a dishwasher, who wants to wash the dishes on holiday!? The farm is lovely will lots of opportunities for walks and wildlife spotting. Thanks John for an excellent stay."

The cottage is beautifully kitted out and you are lacking for nothing. A lovely breakfast awaits you in the fridge. We arrived on a 40 degree day and John had kindly turned on the air conditioning which was very effective. The property leads down to the river an there is even a picnic set for you to use. Highly recommended."
16795559,420840409,2019-03-08,5396190,Alex,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Buckberry Farm. The beautiful stone cottage is perfect for some peace and quiet after a long day exploring the Barossa Valley. We just wish we had more time to stay and relax around the property itself. Unfortunately we didn't find time to head down to the river and have a picnic. Overall the place was very homely, clean, comfortable and in close proximity to all the best cellar doors. The breakfast ingredients supplied in the fridge were especially a really nice touch! Would definitely look to stay here again if we return to the Barossa."
16795559,423074853,2019-03-13,207896022,Alexandra,"This is the perfect private retreat , away from traffic, noise....and people.

This was a wonderful escape, it was peaceful taking a picnic down to the river and seeing the cows come in to the shed in the evening while having a barbeque, this is the place to be for a lot of serenity!! + Super fast communication and close to vineyards if that's what you are after, thank you John!"
16795559,423692468,2019-03-15,41936579,Susan,"We really enjoyed our stay at Buckbury End Farm. The cottage has the perfect combination of rustic charm and modern amenities. Beautiful location and, though on a working farm, felt quite secluded and private. Perfect to use as a base for wine-tasting in the region, or just enjoying a few days away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Would highly recommend."

The farm was fantastic; felt remote but was only a 25 min to the town centre and wonderful wineries. We had a great time!"
16795559,438511904,2019-04-17,49671366,Jenni,What a way to complete your Barossa experience. It was so beautiful waking up surrounded by farm life and finishing the day with a picnic on the banks of the river. John went out of his way to make our sister holiday getaway extra special by including a happy birthday sign. We couldn’t recommend this little cottage more. Thank you
16795559,445216632,2019-04-28,74923849,Zeljko,"Beautifully restored cottage with all the modern appliances for comfortable stay in a hidden section of the beautiful Barossa Valley. Loved all the extra touches like fresh flowering orchids on the dining table, sumptuous Sheridan towels and all the makings for a delicious breakfast including smoked bacon and farm fresh eggs.  John and Jess have done a great job of combining a mix of the historic building with all the items to make you feel like you never left your home.  Would definitely stay there again."
16795559,448136487,2019-05-05,77694126,Deanna,Fantastic stay!!! All we could need in such a beautiful country setting. Will book again when we need a quiet getaway! Absolutely perfect!

Nestling in a working farm, with your own path down to a peaceful picturesque river, you have your very own haven and refuge from which to explore this iconic wine and food Mecca. The cottage is recently renovated to a very high standard, charming classic luxury! All the facilities are perfect and spotless, the hospitality perfect and the breakfast to die for! We will be back and would not consider staying any where else. Private luxury 7 minutes from the first Cellar door - perfection."

16795559,474192389,2019-06-23,19096426,Mark,"As described - a cosy little cottage in the country.  The cottage was warm even though it was very cold outside with the temperature dropping to 1c.  The Air Con was enough to keep us warm, but the open fire added ambience, although you have to bring your own wood.  It was a nice base for a short break from the city and a day out on the bicycles.  The Barossa cycle trail isn’t far away and the Rosedale Scenic Road is worth a detour.  We didn’t need to contact the hosts during our weekend stay, even though they were just next door, because everything we needed was provided and there is a combination key box to let yourself in."
16795559,479438962,2019-07-01,95372271,Amy,An amazing space in a great area. Great ambiance with a fireplace and a well equipped kitchen. Great communication from hosts. A wonderful stay! :)

Its location is absolutely superb to many surrounding wineries and little towns for restaurants, shopping, etc. The cottage is situated in the back of the main house, but allows for full privacy and zen. We enjoyed the gorgeous scenery, the farm atmosphere experience, and ending our nights by the cozy fireplace. It was an absolute great getaway, allowing for full Barossa exploration and ultimate relaxation. We would absolutely be delighted to stay there again."

I took my girlfriend for her birthday and they were kind enough to add a sweet birthday message on the bed for our arrival, and in the entertainment area on the property. The entertainment area was especially beautiful, a perfect place for a BBQ dinner under the stars, sunset, or by the fire. We absolutely loved the property and would recommend it in a heartbeat, John and Jess's hosting skills to add thoughtful touches, provide breakfast, and make sure we felt at home were great extras to make the stay extremely enjoyable."
16795559,551097684,2019-10-19,52067134,Alexandra,"This AirBnB is truly amazing! We absolutely loved our stay.  If you like the country and peace and quiet, this is the place for you.

It's remote enough to feel private and secluded, but close enough to drive everywhere you want to go! There is a lovely walk down the back of the property with a beautiful tree swing by the water.

John and Jess were super easy to contact if needed but we also felt as if we basically had a section of the property to ourselves.
Would definitely recommend."

16795559,571240837,2019-11-30,23793482,Benjamin,What an amazing place to stay! We visited the Barossa to explore over the weekend. John and Jess’s place was the perfect location to explore the Barossa and also relax and enjoy the beautiful views from the patio. The cottage itself is very well appointed and the perfect size for a weekend getaway for 2.

16795559,576615869,2019-12-14,239242080,Mary,We spent two nights at the cottage and were delighted with our stay. John was swift at replying and sent detailed info as to how to reach the farm. We loved the country feel of being on a working farm with accommodation reflecting its rural location but with modern amenities. A great spot to use as a base for visiting the many local wineries. If we lived closer we would be regular visitors!
16795559,584308749,2019-12-29,61881449,Enrique & Jackie,"The Farm cottage was conveniently located close to several wineries in the Barossa region. 

The hosts have thought of everything. The small details made for such a cosy and comfortable stay. The eggs, bacon, bread and milk provided was perfect for breakfast. 

Being located in a farm it is natural that we had several spiders visiting us. Additionally, we may have had more than the usual amount of visitors, due to the heat wave. It made it a bit scary for my partner who is petrified of spiders, even though she grow up in the country. We survived though and the hosts provided bug spray. 

Overall, it is great value for money compared to other offering in the region."

Our weekend ending up being a lot busier than we originally expected but being able to unwind the day on their beautiful property made up for it. The cottage is stunning, their land is beautiful and the homey touches made it very comfortable to stay with our 4 1/2 month old. We hope to go back soon"

It is a little bit further out, however was easy enough for us to find, and our Barossa guide was still more than happy to pick us up from here. As for the space, it was cosy and stylish, and the reverse cycle airconditioning was wonderful on the cool nights we had. It was a great bonus to be able to wander down to the river and experience the bleeting sheep and have a tiny taste of farm living. The breakfast provisions were also most appreciated (and delicious!) Would recommend."

17123473,135369703,2017-03-04,65524735,Siddharth,Great hosts! Made us feel at home with her hospitality. I had an interesting conversation  with Juliane with just about everything from county living to world affairs. Her husband David is great with wines too :). 
17123473,140580264,2017-03-30,43212233,( Beeva ),"Julianne and David are fantastic host's and there home was amazing place to be in. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who wants that place just a little  out of the city, but close enough to everything. Not far from the Barrosa or city if you have a car. Take a drive up Green Valley RD or take the B10 from Tea Tree  Gully. If you need time out to chill and take in a bit of country life this is it. Pub, shops 10 min down road. Dave knows his wines and can teach you a thing or two but nothing goes past the   (Cook) Julianne. The house is immaculate   and I felt at home and had a wonderful time here. I would recommend this to all future guest's"
17123473,142199565,2017-04-07,123566939,Lena,"Julienne och David är det perfekta värdparet - väldigt omtänksamma och trevliga, glada och mycket hjälpsamma och tillmötesgående! Gården var en oas för den som föredrar lugn! "
17123473,142382660,2017-04-07,123566939,Lena,Julienne and David are the best hosts you can have! They showed great hospitality and made us feel at home as soon as we got there. Really the best you can get! I am sure that no one would be dissapointed staying with them. 
17123473,144952367,2017-04-16,10019744,Jennifer,"Julianne and David's hospitality was above anything we could have ever imagined. Still new to staying in people's homes whilst they are there, we were warmly welcomed with food, wine and lots of friendly conversation. We'd strongly recommend a stay here, beautiful and very relaxing. "
17123473,146177738,2017-04-21,26508708,Jacqui,"Julianne and David are very warm and generous hosts. I cannot recommend staying at their place highly enough, their hospitality and property are beautiful. "
17123473,149188469,2017-05-03,2228161,Dany,"Julianne and her husband are wonderful hosts. We stayed just for a night (and also were a bit unorganised being last minute as we were on the road passing through and needed somewhere to rest). Very quick to reply, accommodating, warm and welcoming. They make you feel instantly at home and have so many interesting stories! We had dinner and breakfast cooked for us and a showcase and mini tour of their batch of wine and vineyard -  truly we felt spoilt! Their place is cosy and lovely. A real country cottage feel with a fireplace. The room overlooks the front of their property, is warm even when it was cold outside. It has a comfortable bed and you are provided with everything you need. We definitely will be staying again if we pass through. Highly recommend staying!"
17123473,150060371,2017-05-07,28215659,Matt,Julianne and David were wonderful hosts. They welcomed us warmly and shared their stories. We loved seeing the vineyard!

17123473,154974787,2017-05-27,6340657,Susan,"Julianne and David's home is warm and much thought has gone into making their guests comfortable.  There are even fleecy bathrobes to cozy in on a chilly winter night!  It is obvious that they enjoy opening their home to guests and that part of the experience for them is to get to know their guests.  What wonderful and far-ranging conversations we had over breakfasts and dinners, which were a welcome surprise after our pondering of way too many restaurant menus.  If you want the experience of visiting a working vineyard and learning about the care that goes into it, if you are interested in the more scientific side to wine making, if you want to discuss the local flora and/or you just want to make instant friends, this is the place to stay!"
17123473,157890914,2017-06-05,78431754,Rebecca,We had a wonderful stay with Julianne and David. They were ever so welcoming and even wined and dined us. Their home is beautiful. I would highly recommend staying with them to anyone!
17123473,160635610,2017-06-15,4450549,Borislav,"Lovely place in the heart of South Australia's wine country minutes away from Barossa Valley, Eden Valley, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills and equally lovely hosts who went out of their way to make us feel at home. Both Julianne and David were more than generous with their time giving us the grand tour of their farm and vineyard the grapes of which made Charles Melton's ""The Voice of Angels"" vintage a delectable and incontestable winner. They shared with us their home, company, and food as well as a treasure trove of knowledge about the region's history, wine-making, award-winning vintages, and Aussie indigenous flora and fauna. Spotting wildlife in the vineyard was one of the many delightful surprises we experienced. Kangaroos were grazing and romping around on the farm and did not mind being photographed and going on (Hidden by Airbnb) . Actually, our first up-close-and-personal encounter with a live roo happened on the first day of our visit in Mount Pleasant. Also, we loved being serenaded in the morning by a mellifluous chorus of flamboyantly colored and plumaged native birds. Our plan was to spend just one day, but we loved it so much here that we ended up staying 4 days. A day is merely not enough for a complete immersion in the spirit of this awesome place Down Under. We cannot wait to come back before long and savor the flavor of Barossa Valley and its warm and friendly people."
17123473,165102504,2017-06-30,137553959,Justin,Julianne & David were very hospitable and welcomed me into their home with open arms. It was a shame I didn't have much time to look around the rolling hills where they very fortunately call home.
17123473,193534452,2017-09-14,6680423,Hilary And Kevin,"Julianne's home was set in the most beautiful countryside and surrounded by a wonderful garden full of wildlife. We were greeted with a warm welcome and we shared a lovely meal over a glass of wine, (my first experience) thank you so very much for your hospitality, especially as it was booked at such short notice.
I wish you every success in your Airbnb venture."

Julianne and her husband David were very hospitable and beyond generous. My wife and I left their home full of gratitude! 
I would highly recommend staying here- you will enjoy it!"

Cannot recommend this property enough, the bed was amazingly comfortable; I don't usually sleep well away from home but had no problem  . .  :)

Thanks guys, for a lovely stay.

Both were absolutely friendly, helpful and open-minded. The communication was easy and great, everything was clean and cozy. 

After showing us their whole vineyard (which is beautiful), they invited us for a delicious home made dinner. We were treated very well and enjoyed every minute. Furthermore, we got great recommendations for our trip.

Thank you for everything - we would definitely come back again!
Already missing your hospitality and the ""Traktor"" ;)

Julianne is a fantastic host and made us very welcome and she has loads of local knowledge and a great guide to the Barossa wineries.

Accommodating, informative, warm, funny are just a few ways to describe these amazing people.  Do not hesitate to book this place if you have the opportunity."

The level of comfort and their hospitality could not be faulted. They are keen to share their extensive knowledge on the region , the environment and the wine industry. A special Airbnb experience."
17123473,333898363,2018-10-08,19432905,Ulla,We had a great experience in Julianne’s and David’s place. They are very easygoing and interesting people to talk with. They work around the vineyard and still have time and interest to their community. Highly recommend.
17123473,336121312,2018-10-14,186702488,Adam,This place is fantastic! it's in a lovely rural setting.  the room is very comfy.  the hosts are super nice (Julianne even sewed my button back on my shirt before we were due to head to a wedding!). i would highly recommend this place
17123473,338568736,2018-10-20,44748931,Caitlin,"Julianne and David have such a cute little house out in the wine country. Their home is warm, welcoming, and comfortable. Their land is beautiful, set just outside a tiny country town. It is a bit remote, but that wasn't a problem for us with our own car. Seriously, go walk through their vineyards and gardens, it's so peaceful and breathtaking. It really relaxes you! We even saw a kangaroo hop on through :) David gave us a taste of his wine, but we also explored the wineries nearby and had a few tastings. 

Julianne and David were super accommodating and so sweet. We loved staying up chatting with them until we were all too tired to continue. It was much too short of a stay, and we will definitely be back again to stay longer with them! If you're passing through and want an affordable, comfortable, clean, homey-stay in the Barossa Wine Region, definitely book with Julianne and David!"
17123473,348205139,2018-11-12,219058341,Christine,"Outstanding hosts, amazing value, you will not be disappointed. I can’t recommend them highly enough"

17123473,367012949,2019-01-03,231759231,Trevor,"Staying with Julianne and David is very much a 'sharing our home' experience. Their property is located in a beautiful area of the Adelaide Hills/Torrens Valley and you are made to feel like a visiting family member, rather than an air B&B client.

They have an extensive knowledge of their local area and are great tour guides/advisers.  Hearing the story of their property and its history, it's not hard to see why they have such a passion for what they do. 

Highly recommended and we'll certainly stay with Julianne and David again on our next SA trip."

Everything was so wonderful - from my fluffy down comforter and bathrobe, to the interesting conversations, to the views of the vineyards. I just wish I could have stayed longer. The location is awesome- in the Barossa Valley but a little bit off the beaten track. Overall, I can not recommend this place enough. Thank you so much for the incredible hospitality!"

We haven't been in a use of bedroom in a shared house before and were a little unsure how it would be. We were made you feel at home and enjoyed our chats. It was lovely to be on a farm too. Very enjoyable.

No doubt they'll be asking me to book here for them again next time they visit the area "

Only thing I would say is just message them in advance to check about using their cooking facilities if you are arriving later in the day. Their Internet can be a bit dodgy- but that's not really a problem!  Otherwise it was a lovely stay and I would reccomend people staying here!"

From the moment we walked in till the moment we left, it was clear that an incredible amount of care had been taken to provide everything we could possibly need - from milk, coffee and herbal tea to a complementary bottle of wine, fresh figs and strawberries. Not to mention fresh homemade biscuits on departure! 

It's very well positioned as well - a tranquil setting and right in the midst of the best wine region.

I'm already looking forward to my next stag and would highly recommend to anyone exploring the beautiful Barossa. "

We were so well looked after, with some lovely little surprise extras. The breakfast was spot on with homemade granola, yummy bread, fresh strawberries and coffee. The place itself was simple and beautifully presented and it was so lovely to lie in bed with the papers listening to the church bells on Sunday morning. Would highly recommend the hike up the hill to the quarry to take in the views back over Light Pass and the vines... followed by a dip in the pool! We will be back."

Tracy left us delicious homemade cookies and granola and left milk, juice, fruit and wine. There was a coffee maker with coffee pods and tea with fresh lemon from their lemon tree. The property is surrounded by vineyards in the small town of Light  Pass in the northern part of the Barossa Valley. Perfect for exploring. Highly recommended."

When walking into the cottage, we found baked cookies and sour dough bread, freshly prepared granola, fresh strawberries and a bottle of complimentary Yalumba wine. It was a very generous offering, not to mention delicious. The cottage was clean and cosy. Tracy and Matt were friendly and always available for any questions. Tracey even provided us crackers on the last night when we missed our chance to buy them as the local Foodland was closed. Thank you once again for the amazing hospitality. It made our Barossa trip unforgettable!"

Great little kitchenette with bread, granola and coffee included which we had each morning in the yard which was lovely. The two dogs and other family that we met were friendly and we were made to feel welcome.

It's very clean, well stocked amenities in the house and thoughtful touches added to the house. Pillows and doona (although we didn't need it with the 40 degrees temperature) were good quality. We also had fun with the table tennis and pool table. A bit disappointed we didn't get the chance to use the bike due to the high temperature. Hope to come back again.."

Thanks again Cathy it was just perfect."

We were there in winter and found the back half of the house (toilet, laundry & bunk room) very cold and difficult to heat. Didn’t even check out the games room or bikes as found ourselves snuggled in front of TV on nights we stayed in. Appreciated the free access to Netflix. Bedrooms and living areas cosy and comfortable. House is not as contemporary as appears in photos but done up nicely."

17720616,593122621,2020-01-14,132589033,James,This was a lovely place to stay while my family and I visited the Barossa Valley. This house is perfectly located close to everything making exploring the region very easy. Cathy was able to provide some tips for local places to visit which proved a hit.

17720616,619545131,2020-03-18,530942,Carrie,"What a house! We loved every aspect. Check in was easy with the code on the door. The house is well stocked with anything you would want for basic cooking, and we were able to make our own breakfast and coffee daily an eat on the patio outside. The beds have different firmness levels so you can pick the one that suits you best. We enjoyed playing pool and ping pong in the early evening.  And did I mention the bathtub?!? The neighborhood is very quiet and we slept well. There are a/c units if needed; the first night was chilly and there were extra blankets in the closet, and the next day was 94 Fahrenheit and we were able to use the a/c to keep us comfortable. We got amazing suggestions of things to do and places to go when we arrived, and all the good stuff in the Barossa is within a 15-20 minute drive.  We would absolutely stay here again."
17720616,720249419,2020-12-31,165570488,Carly,"We loved staying here. It's so close to everything, and has a beautiful garden/outdoor space for down time between trips to wineries. It also cost us the same to stay here in a spacious and comfortable house as it did for our friends to stay in a cabin at the caravan park. We'll stay here again."

The house is combined with modern and classic, and we very much enjoyed our time in the house after a day of wine testing; Lovely host even provided us with complimentary wine & food,  can't thank enough.

BTW, Natalie, it will be good to update your house photos online, as they all seems quite blurry, the house is much better than those photos :)

The house was warm and cosy by the fire in the evenings, perfect way to finish a days wine touring.  There are restaurants within walking distant and a grocery store.  Showers are lovely and hot and plenty of water pressure.  Would love to come back in the summer  and get an opportunity to use the wonderful outdoor area."

The house was very welcoming and the hosts were more than generous with leaving us muffins, muesli, milk and juice for our morning breakfasts.

17721773,182108338,2017-08-14,15325194,John,Natalie's place was presented in perfect condition.  The quality all the things that matter were first class.

17721773,235772436,2018-02-17,155081106,Leonie,"A girlfriend and I enjoyed a relaxing long weekend retreat at Somerton House this past weekend. Hosts Natalie and Virginia communicated exceptionally well and very promptly in every instance prior to and during our stay. Although we stayed on a self-contained basis so did not meet them, we found them welcoming, obliging and incredibly helpful - offering suggestions re things to do, places to eat, etc. All the information we might have needed was provided and at hand.  The renovated and extended bungalow has been tastefully furnished in keeping with the original building, but with all the modern comforts. It was impeccably clean and boasts a well-equipped modern kitchen with lots of bench space. Rooms are large, there is a huge double shower in the main bathroom, plus another in the second bathroom where the toilet is. The solar-heated pool and its surrounds were a highlight - I would agree with others that the online photos don’t do the home justice, especially the rear outdoor undercover area, which is spacious and beautifully outfitted. Highly recommended "

The kitchen set up is excellent for those self catering and the nice touches on arrival meant we didn't need to race out grocery shopping the minute we arrived.

You can stroll out for coffee, a wine at the wine bar or at a Taste of Eden or stay in an laze by the pool. Just lovely."

17721773,413690100,2019-02-17,12243763,Holly,"Absolutely stunning property in Angaston. Both bedrooms are large and comfortable and the outside space is stunning. Beautiful pool and outdoor entertaining area, highly recommended to a small family/two couples. Will definitely be back!"
17721773,415921390,2019-02-23,39082966,Blair,"This property was immaculate in every way, and the welcome basket on arrival was a nice little touch to make you feel right at home. I would highly recommend a stay here"
17721773,418701233,2019-03-02,191272300,Simon,"Similar to other reviews, we felt the photos didn't do this place justice. There is everything you need - it's a home away from home, and the outdoor living area is wonderful. The arrival pack was well received, particularly the coffee - thanks! And check-in is a breeze. The pool is warm, and everything about the stay offers a private getaway. The house is in a quiet street, yet close enough to the main street where takeaways and a grocery store provide the essentials. We loved our stay and enjoyed exploring the Barossa. We'll be back."
17721773,444401607,2019-04-28,27818510,Hannah,"We had an absolutely fabulous two night stay at Natalie's place. Check in was very easy and on arrival we were all 'wowed' by how spacious and beautifully decorated the house is. The welcome basket was very gratefully received and a lovely welcoming touch. The bedrooms were spacious and very comfortable and we all loved that there were electric blankets! We really enjoyed sitting outside on the big sofa in the mornings and early evenings - we would have probably spent every second of our time in that space had we stayed during the height of summer. The kitchen facilities were fantastic, we did cook a few meals during our stay and found everything we needed with ease. The swimming pool was a great luxury. Only one of us braved it in the cooler weather but the water is heated and clean and had we stayed longer or in summer we all certainly would have given it a go. The house is a very short walk from the centre of Angaston and we were also able to walk to Yalumba Estate easily which made for a great afternoon out. Natalie's place is just perfect if your looking for a luxurious getaway in The Barossa Valley.

Thank you again Natalie for a fabulous stay!"
17721773,467041221,2019-06-10,163523499,Jordan,"Natalie’s place is a beautiful sanctuary, we had a great first visit to The Barossa Valley and will definitely be back. Hosts are very helpful with local knowledge and quick responses. Unfortunately it wasn't quite warm enough to jump in the pool, will have to return in summer."

Thanks you so much. We had the best weekend. We travelled as 8 adults sisters and cousins with their partners.Would recommend this house for either families or a group of couples wanting a Barossa experience , the home had everything you need. Great sound system, tv's all u want!!
Thank you Jason, for giving us the best of weekends!
Cheers
Mark "
17862552,187304924,2017-08-26,25170465,Kanako,"The house is beautiful, very clean. The only challenge we had was we ran out of hot water on the second night. No Wi-Fi, only at an extra cost which we weren't aware of, no Telstra Air connection on the tv and the dvd was a little bit temperamental.  The hotwater system we found out later, has a timer so would recommend not taking a shower early evening. Just first thing or late at night as the hotwater system doesn't fill up again. 
Jason and his wife seemed nice enough. 
However couldn't recommend this place for the price."
17862552,189798498,2017-09-03,130188520,Adam,"We stayed here over the Barossa Gourmet weekend and it was everything we expected and more. Lovely, clean rooms and great spaces to sit and chat with a large group. Will most certainly stay here again if we head back to the Barossa."
17862552,205331414,2017-10-22,15331749,Diana,Jason's home is lovely! It is well appointed and very well stocked so we had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. The home is well located within Tanunda with everything in close proximity so ideal as a base for exploring the wonderful Barossa Valley. Jason was very prompt with communication which made booking effortless. It was a great Airbnb experience and definitely somewhere I'd recommend others enjoy when in the Barossa.
17862552,214440592,2017-11-26,21955171,Michelle,"Thank you so much to Jason for allowing us the opportunity to stay at LiebenGott.  Everything was thought of......even down to having lovely chilled water in the fridge waiting for us after a long walk! Every amenity was catered for and the communication was fantastic. Would certainly recommend it a will certainly be back again.
Thanks

The house was very clean when we arrived and the air conditioning was on and the house cool which was great as it was a 40 degree day. The house was well stocked with all the general supplies you would need and was very comfortable. We were two couples plus two small children under 2 and it was just perfect for our needs. The host Jasón was very easy to communicate with and was a fantastic host. Check in was super easy as well.

There are 4 bedrooms upstairs and 2.5 bathrooms. 2 of the bedrooms have tv's. Downstairs a family room overlooks the park, there is a fully equipped kitchen and a pool table which provided so much fun over our weekend. The layout of the house is fantastic and has spaces for everyone to relax whether you want time alone to read a book,  spend time with your group for a game of pool, etc, or have a quiet drink in the sitting room where a baby grand piano sits for anyone who can play. Jason, (host), was fantastic, replying to my messages within minutes. Thank you so much, our weekend was so relaxing, which was just what we all needed. We will definitely be back. A rare find."

17963507,143488382,2017-04-12,82385895,Cameron,"Lesley Ann's place was a welcome oasis after a long day touring the Barossa. She was a most hospitable and welcoming host, willing to guide us on our food and wine journey through the Barossa. Everything we needed was provided for and our stay was most enjoyable. "

17963507,146195104,2017-04-22,1487493,Luca,"Lesley Ann è persona molto di classe, disponibilissima e simpaticissima. La casa che mette a disposizione degli ospiti è meravigliosa, e solo la mancanza del bidet è un disagio che mi impedisce di dare il massimo punteggio. Il wifi funziona benone e non c'era traccia di insetti. La colazione fornita era gustosa e completa. Il giardino circostante è bello tranquillo e silenzioso e la zona è strategica per la Barossa Valley."
17963507,146883539,2017-04-24,17063249,Claire,"Lesley Ann is a fantastic host, her studio is beautiful and well appointed, very close to the centre of town. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and will definitely be back!"
17963507,148112408,2017-04-30,19157770,Ian,"The writers cottage at Tununda offers the perfect getaway for soulful self time, a romantic escape or just to enjoy the many and varied offerings of the colourful Barossa region. Perfectly located right in the heart of Tununda, character and charm ooze from from this little slice of heaven in the Adelaide Hills. Adorned with original artworks and quirky charm, the warmth of this little love nest is matched only only by the hospitality of its host Lesley-Anne and the beauty of its surroundings. Highly recommended, we’ll be back, both for Lesley Anne, the writers cottage itself and the fabulous varietals on offer in this unsurpassed wine making region "
17963507,152099642,2017-05-15,23269740,Sarah,"You will not be disappointed. This studio is perfect for a couple - plenty of space and privacy and lots of little comforts. It's also clean and cosy. The photos do not do it justice. We were absolutely thrilled when we arrived. The location is also perfect, being centrally positioned to explore wineries and you can easily walk to Fermentasian or Zwines, etc. for dinner. Lesley Ann was a lovely host, and she has obviously put a lot of TLC into the accommodation. "
17963507,153354077,2017-05-21,59674031,Chris,"The studio is outstanding. Located 5mins walk from the Main Street but you feel like you're in your own little world. Lesley Ann was the perfect host with lots of good advice for places to visit. 
"
17963507,156957882,2017-06-02,73725293,Nancy,"Leslie Ann's place is the best place we've stayed on our journey (and that's saying something for a 7 month trip).  Her place is well situated (all of the services you'll need are very close - and yet, the area is very quiet), plenty of room, the cottage is wonderfully decorated - and - very close to all Barossa wineries.  You will need a car for any serious exploration of the vast number of outstanding wineries. This place is extremely well located to get to all cellar doors.  Leslie Ann is a perfect host; extremely interesting to talk with (knows gobs about Barossa and about wine) and just an all around great person.  If you are going to Barossa - you've got to book Leslie Ann's place.  Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed."
17963507,157424320,2017-06-04,130238980,Annie,"Close to shops and restaurants, but felt like our own little hideaway.  Lesley Ann shared local knowledge of the area and great places to eat and visit.  Awesome host.  Thank you for sharing your home with us."
17963507,158688850,2017-06-08,8679013,Bobby Anne,"The photos are accurate but can't capture the wonderfully calm and positive ambience of the space.   The moment I walked in I knew that this was a special place.  Loads of space, lots of light from the large windows on three sides with completely private views onto the garden. Clean, cosy and comfortable.   A quiet, tranquil space and yet less to than 10 minutes walk to Murray Street  and the shops and restaurants.  (However, car necessary to go further afield.) Lesley Ann is the perfect, thoughtful host.  I definitely plan to stay here again.  Highly recommended for either a business trip or a holiday escape.  "
17963507,159899368,2017-06-12,5407410,Melissa,"We loved our stay in the writers studio. It was very clean, quiet, bright and very comfortable!

The bed was incredibly comfortable, I slept like a baby! Great cooking facilities, lots of books to read in the comfy mezzanine nook area and a beautiful garden. A lovely area that's very close to the shops, cafes and wineries. I hired a bike and cycled round the Barossa and this was the perfect base. Thank you Lesley Ann for being so lovely and welcoming, I'll be telling all my friends and family :)"
17963507,164343354,2017-06-27,60828455,Lawrence,Lovely place and an absolutely amazing host! Lesley Ann was extremely friendly and accommodating during our stay. She supplied us with inside information about the region and things to do. The accomodation was even better than described as Lesley Ann had left some local food for us to make breakfast with. Location was also on point. 
17963507,165753437,2017-07-02,21027178,Ana,Had a lovely weekend: Leslie Ann was a generous & welcoming host and the home was warm & comfortable.  Would definitely come again another day!  Thank you so much!

Lesley Ann is full of great recommendations and knows everything about the region. We really appreciated Lesley Ann’s  kind spirit and knowledgeable. 
We wouldn’t think twice about staying in the Writer’s Studio next time we visited the Barossa. Thanks Lesley Ann!


"
17963507,168693135,2017-07-10,133154642,Jessica,"We had a truly wonderful weekend at the Writer's Shed. Lesley provided a very warm welcome, and had decked out the fridge with all the necessities for a cup of a tea and a cooked breakfast. This was particularly appreciated after we left our bag of food back home in Adelaide! The place was so much more beautiful in real life than the photos could capture, we didn't want to leave. Lesley is a fantastic host, and was very willing to provide us with tips to maximise our weekend stay. Will spread the word and hopefully be back!"
17963507,169248026,2017-07-12,23252327,Jennifer,"Perfect place, in a great location. Very responsive and generous host. The place was cosy and filled with great jigsaw puzzles and books to keep us occupied. Would stay again!  "

Perfect secluded location close to restaurants, shops and wineries. Lesley Anne is the perfect host. And we wanted for nothing. . Pamela Adelaide. July 2017. "
17963507,170532543,2017-07-15,9566451,Simone,"The Barossa Valley is fantastic: great wines, tasty food and beautiful landscape. The writer's studio is a beautifully/tastefully decorated self-contained shed, with good facilities, very quiet, and centrally located, providing access (by car) to all villages nearby. Lesley Ann was a great host, offering her local knowledge of the region, but also providing us with privacy. The only problem we found was the inflatable bed, which was not very comfortable."
17963507,171562578,2017-07-18,32202732,Anna,"The Writer's Studio was a really fantastic place to get away for a few days. It was walkable to some wineries and restaurants and the studio itself was well decorated clean, and well stocked with kitchen gear and entertainment for rainy days (which we definitely used). We would absolutely stay again. "
17963507,172428317,2017-07-21,52727609,Emily,"We stayed at the Writer's studio as the last stop on a two week holiday - it was the highlight of our trip! Lesley Ann welcomed us warmly with a hand written note, fresh bread and milk, and supplies for bacon and eggs for breakfast.

The studio is comfortable, warm and clean and is decorated with so many interesting pieces of art. The blow up bed has a base and a pump to top it up and we found that it was as comfortable as a normal bed. Lesley Ann was also extremely attentive and immediately followed up an unavoidable maintenance issue. 

We really loved the selection of puzzles, books and games, the little mezzanine floor was the perfect spot to relax in the afternoon with a cup of tea and a book.

Our advice is for everyone to ask Lesley Ann where they should visit in the Barossa. Her recommendations made our holiday, we wish we could give an extra star. We would come back here in a heart beat - next time for a longer stay! "
17963507,173792641,2017-07-24,131966807,Loan,Beautiful and very cosy. Close to the shops and walkable distance to the main cafes and street of Tanunda. It is tucked away so no traffic noise.

Lesley Ann is an amazing hostess and the Writer's Studio is a must for a couple looking for a quick getaway from city life! 
17963507,174747233,2017-07-27,132006164,Tyler,"Thank you so much Lesley Ann!! This was such a beautiful location, house and all round experience. The studio was so warm, homely and inviting. There were beautiful flowers outside and views from the attic. There is no doubt I'll be back to get some quiet study done or be in close vicinity to Barossas best wineries again. Thanks :)"

It was my first time in the Barossa and the location couldn't have been better, nor could I have asked for anything more from Lesley Ann as a host and the studio - was so well stocked, and a little bit magical! Lesley Ann made it feel as though we were staying at the back of an old friend's place, with lots of local tips and hot spots of where to go for great food and wine. She was so lovely, I'll definitely be back!"

17963507,258870668,2018-04-30,153829537,Lucy,"Lesley Ann's place is the perfect spot for a weekend exploring the Barossa. The studio space itself is quirky, comfortable and beautiful and had everything my partner and I needed. It is a short walk to the main street in Tanunda including the Foodland if you need to stock up. There is also an amazing Cellar Door on the corner of Lesley Ann's street and the main rd, Z Wines. 
Although the studio is at the back of Lesley Ann's place it is private and quiet. Lesley Ann was a fabulous host and was able to recommend a number of great spots for wine tasting and eating and we will most certainly be back to check out those we couldn't make it to all in the weekend. Cannot thank Lesley Ann enough!"
17963507,260457309,2018-05-04,125315518,Jess,"This is by far the best place to stay in Barossa. Really loved our time here. It’s a really large space, feels private and tucked away at the back of the house. It’s a cute converted shed with amazing decor and a nice outlook on the garden. The kitchen is completely stocked with everything you could need. We were treated to fresh bread/eggs and bacon on arrival which was such a nice touch. The bed was so comfortable, doesn’t feel like a blow up at all. Had the best sleeps in it! Did not want to leave. The location is perfect for exploring Barossa, right out the front of a winery. Thanks Lesley for the tips and hospitality. We will be back."
17963507,261767183,2018-05-07,12162500,Joelle,"Stayed with Lesley Ann for two nights as part of our honeymoon (kid free!). Had such a lovely stay, the writer’s studio is beautiful and cosy and private also. So many nice touches too, such as the breakfast goodies and welcome note! Great location, close to eateries and wineries, can’t recommend Lesley Ann’s place and Tanunda itself for a break away from it all."

Lesley Ann is to be congratulated on her initiative to create such comfortable and interesting accommodation. The studio is ideal for two people and has all the comforts and provisions of home plus extra. We stayed here for one week in total comfort and was a highlight of our time in the Barossa. The personalized service and attention was an added bonus to our stay.

We loved the fresh bread, eggs and tomatoes left for us to create a tasty breakfast. The bed is super comfy and the gorgeous lighting  in the studio adds to the cozy feel. It’s walking distance to 1918 for dinner, which was lovely. And Lesley Ann’s recommendation for The Eatery at Maggie Beers for lunch and Artisans of Barossa for wine tasting were spot on. We can’t wait to return to the area again!"

Lesley Ann kindly left some yummy goodies for us to enjoy during breakfast. She was very easy to communicate with. She lives in the main house within the property - however, the deck has lots of privacy.  
Close to shops etc, and short drive to nice wineries and restaurants :)"

We spent two days there during winter....the weather was pretty wet on one day and we had no hestiation staying indoors, cooking lunch and sharing a bottle or two of local wine.  Take your time to look at all the books that surround one of the walls. The location is just down the road from the local Foodland, near the Workers Club...(great for a meal) and also down the road from Z a winebar...what more do you need?"

It was quiet and private also close to town and right in the Barossa. (We booked a tour for one of the days so we could both have drinks and they picked us up and dropped us off at the front which was great). Lesley Ann was a great host, she provided us with delicious breakfast supplies. We had fresh (locally made) bread, bacon, eggs and coffee everyday which meant we could set off exploring easily without searching for breakfast first in town (fantastic!) Lesley Ann had some great recommendations, we went to a number of wineries and restaurants she suggested and loved them all! We highly recommend staying here. Thank you again for a great stay Lesley Ann."

Location is also great: from here you just walk within 10 mins to the best winebar and restaurant in town, how great is that.
Lesley Ann is a perfect host. I work in wine and she provided me with the exact right directions. She more than knows her way around the wineries so her advice is gold. And she gives you all the space you need but is always available to help out. And she is just a very kind, good and smart & savvy person.
This place was just what I needed, travelling alone and with my roadbike, as a base for cycletraining through the Barossa and visiting the best wineries in the area, all in a short timeperiod."

It is a v relaxing space full of great colour and texture from her world travels.  Some unexpected delights on arrival made it very inviting.  Her food and wine tasting tips were spot-on, making our stay even better than expected.  The Barossa and Eden Valleys are a delight for exploring wine and food - punching well above their weight.  Lesley Ann's studio is well worth a visit when you are stopping by in the Barossa."

Located close enough to the center of Tanunda to stroll into town, but far enough out for a sense of peace and quiet, the Studio has been comfortably furnished and beautifully decorated. 
Lesley Ann, our gracious host, also provided accoutrements like fresh milk and bread, and locally produced coffee, which made staying in during rainy weather as enjoyable as our adventures out and about.
Wouldn't hesitate to recommend this space to any couple looking for a getaway."

Great kitchen facilities, hot shower, comfortable bed, and the upstairs reading/relaxation nook is a particularly beautiful space.
Lesley Ann was a terrific host and had plenty of local knowledge and tips to share, which we hope to take advantage of next visit. 
We really enjoyed the Farmer's Market in Angaston on Saturday morning and Vino Lokal in Tanunda (walking distance from the studio).

The Writer's Studio is exactly what it says on the tin, quirky and relaxing! 
As always the stays are made by the host and although we didn't get to spend much time chatting to Lesley-Ann she made us feel very welcome and we even got a tour of the vegetable and fruit patch!! 
Very fresh I highly recommend borrowing some to cook with your food, delicious!
Tanunda is such a lovely little town and it helps when you have somewhere to go that feels like home.
Would highly recommend and we will be back!"
17980547,146468764,2017-04-23,126550255,Joseph,"The property is amazing and makes for a great getaway; its peaceful and plenty of space to go for a wonder around. Peter and Marijan were the best hosts we could ask for; they made sure we had everything we needed, were easy to get hold of, and offered us a late check out. Marijan even left us amazing pikelets and comquat marmalade!!! She's a gem!! The cottage is quaint and cosy. A woodfire in the living room hearkens to the cooler months ensconsed in the inviting warmth of the fire with a fabulous red and a book. The gardens are remarkable; we had the chance to observe the changeling colours of autumn in the trees. We imagine spring would be amazing too. There is a vineyard to meander through, and lamas and sheep share this wonderful retreat with you. We cannot wait to return and spend a few days retreating in these beautiful surrounds. "
17980547,152517190,2017-05-17,126715938,Tony,"We stayed here for work, it had a great location and large spaces for parking even enough room for the truck. more then that it offered the space need in the house for our crew. the gardens and surrounding land offer piece and quite after a hard days work. The host went the extra mile to make us welcome and feel like we were at home. The history was lost on the boys but it wasn't hard to see."
17980547,153142301,2017-05-20,128341494,Cat,"Marijan and Peter were very welcoming and very knowledgeable of the land they have taken on and let us explore their property, with a private tour while we stayed for a lovely two nights on their glorious estate. 
Will highly recommend and definitely return in the future to see their hard work and progress on the estate to relax in the peace and quiet of the mountains. "
17980547,153403759,2017-05-21,20734867,Selina,"The house is really nice and comfortable, there is everything you need. We had a very good time walking around in the hills, petting the alpacas on the property and everybody was really nice and caring and Marijan was happy explaining things and giving us tips about where to go in the Barossa, walking trails etc."
17980547,168115449,2017-07-09,26181840,Jacquie,"Marijan and Peter's cottage is a special place. You can pick your poison there: relax by the open fire, breathe deep as you wander the beautiful property, or jump in your car for a delicious visit to a local cellar door. The accommodation is just as it is described - very functional and comfortable. The open fire kept the cottage perfectly warm and added wonderful atmosphere. Marijan was a fantastic host. She had the cottage prepped for every eventuality, made us pikelets, and stayed up late to greet us as we arrived in the pouring rain. Make sure you take her up on her offer to have a tour around the property - it is wonderful. We will definitely be coming back to Martinsell. We loved it. "
17980547,169550283,2017-07-13,2777604,Michael,Awesome hosts - went out of their ways to accommodate us. Will definitely recommend and stay here again.
17980547,170589684,2017-07-16,136840888,Tim,"Lovely county property. Right at Mt Crawford for walking, bike/horse riding. Great view out across the paddock. Well equipped for family weekend away. Great hosts. "
17980547,172792273,2017-07-22,9670622,Antony,"Marijan greeted us at the gate and had the fire roaring for us on arrival. It's a quiet old property with sheep and alpacas roaming freely. The cottage is decorated in a simple style and is impeccably clean and comfortable. We brought our own cheese platter and a meal to pop in the oven so we were playing cards in front of the fire in no time. We opted to spend the next day on a short hike up Mt Crawford and then a drive through Angaston, Tanunda and Birdwood. Marijan's place was the ideal accommodation to feel like we'd really gotten away from it all and we'd love to return some day to see more of the area."
17980547,177811056,2017-08-04,25445354,Lisa,Gorgeous property in the barossa with plenty of wildlife!  The sheep and alpacas were lovely to watch and the indoor fire was cozy.   I would definitely recommend this roomy cottage!
17980547,178585826,2017-08-06,26973596,Malcolm & Lynn,"Peter and Marijan's property is in easy reach of Barossa Valley wineries and sites, numerous walking trails like the Heysen Trail and mountain bike routes. It is also perfect for relaxing. It is an interesting and historic property important for the history of the Barossa. Our accommodation was above the original barn, simple, functional, exceptionally clean and a little old fashioned. We loved Marijan's pikelets, the tour of the main house and the efficient combustion heater in the cold winter's weather. Thank you Marijan and Peter for minding our bags and the enjoyable stay."
17980547,184490394,2017-08-20,112872020,Varuni,"Peter and Marijan's place was lovely. It was on a road less traveled but the property was charming and old worldly. Because it has a history - the property is getting restored bit by bit and it's wonderful to step back in time and take in the atmosphere. We wanted a break and a breather from the city and the place was exceptional. Billy and Sterling (the Alpacas) were adorable and we loved the tour of the property. Our son got to experience what it is like to be a farmer. Overall it was a wonderful stay and because it's a short drive to Williamstown, Tanunda and Angoston, we enjoyed the local eateries and delicacies as well. Wonderful place to stay while on holiday."
17980547,186205246,2017-08-24,1741798,Kari,Oh my goodness if you want to experience a beautiful rustic retreat then this is the place to go. We were greeted with a warm cottage and some friendly alpacas. Our beds were so warm and cosy had the best sleep and that fresh country air just added to it all. Do your self a favour if you're going to the Barossa stay here.
17980547,187933918,2017-08-28,57346159,Adam,"Thank you for the very peaceful  and warm stay at your beautiful place. the whole place was perfect and the hosts are super friendly, i couldn't have hoped for anything more"
17980547,192171641,2017-09-10,60859337,Glenn,"Quiet, secluded, fresh air, very special farmhouse type ambience. 
Marijan is a very welcoming host. 
The home itself is simple yet comfortable, like walking back 40 years in time and some of the furnishings and implements match that era. 
Lovely to wake up and see ""Dorper"" sheep grazing outside your window. The legendary Roos did not make an appearance but we didn't miss it!
The surroundings are lovely for walking and exploring
and offer ruins, pine forests, streams and vistas of rolling hills. 
For a family used to life in inner Adelaide, this was quite magical."
17980547,195008377,2017-09-18,10687993,Tina,Lovely farm style stay in beautiful rural surroundings. Thank you for hosting

17980547,210347964,2017-11-09,100968803,Amy,"Don't miss the opportunity to stay at Martinsell and Pewsey Vale! Marijan and Peter have created the most beautiful place here -- the cottage is in such a glorious setting, and the sheep, alpacas and old gums make it really special.  Marijan has thought of everything, and their tips for outings and places to eat were spot on. Our son will never forget helping hand-feed the baby lamb and the alpaca gents. Thank you so much for a gorgeous couple of days -- we hope to be back!"
17980547,210941652,2017-11-11,138044246,Noel,"We would highly recommend this as a stay for groups both big and small. The property is incredibly picturesque and is ideal for relaxing outside or taking walks. 

The cottage was spacious and comfortable with everything we needed. The host Marijan was very hospitable in offering us a tour of the property; the stories behind the manor  and the gardens added a tremendous amount of enjoyment for us as a group.

The area is easily accessible with a car and the local wineries and town markets are a short drive away. Without a doubt we would love to go back."
17980547,212230360,2017-11-16,143062870,John,"We had a great time at Martinsell Cottage and would return there anytime. We loved the pleasant and unique rural location. Marijan met us at the gate (it was drizzling) and welcomed us in. We learned the history of the property, which we partly knew, enjoyed the convivial atmosphere and the guided tour of their property.  Mt Crawford and Martinsell is a great place to visit."
17980547,216449961,2017-12-03,75122823,Craig,"Wonderful greeting with freshly cut roses and plenty of helpful advice regarding the Barossa from Marijan. The location was excellent with everything a nice driving distance, yet very quiet and tranquil. Thoroughly recommend for anyone visiting the area."

The alpacas and sheep were a huge hit with our young girls and the location is fabulous. Very close to all the attractions of the Barossa.
17980547,224670540,2018-01-03,140018607,Akira,"Marijian helps a lot and very friendly.
Very relaxing place with the nature."
17980547,225560081,2018-01-07,17665342,Brent,"Peter and Marijan made us feel so very at home in their beautiful cottage. Marijan even gave us a private tour of their stunning sprawling property! There are sheep and alpaca running around, all very friendly, and the cottage has everything you need. A quiet and cozy place, 20 minutes drive from the centre of the Barossa. I recommend staying here as the drive to town is beautiful, with a limit over the region as you drive in to town. I can't wait for them to finish the work on their château, as it is already looking amazing and luxurious, and a great alternative to the cottage."
17980547,226463417,2018-01-10,71060757,Paulo,"Very friendly, comfortable house, spotless clean and Marijan and Peter will be the best hosts of your trip!!"
17980547,238004162,2018-02-25,22552902,Lisa,"Marijan has been an absolutely wonderful host! She has given us local tips on where to eat and visit, showed us the manor (including recounting its heritage), and also allowed us to visit her wonderful sheep and alpacas. The place itself is very peaceful and the air is simply so fresh and crisp. We would love to visit again!"

17980547,282980682,2018-06-28,128978056,Noreen,"The Cottage was so spacious,  well furnished with everything you could want, a lovely wood fire as well as the reverse cycle meant the main living area was toasty and warm.  The hosts are really lovely people who could not have been more friendly and approachable.  The property itself is magnificent, with  the most beautiful gum trees and grounds with wonderful old buildings full of character."
17980547,284674608,2018-07-02,190169745,Brendan,This gorgeous cottage is in an absolutely picturesque location. Waking to see the magnificent sunrise over the vineyards and walking amongst the grounds is a magical experience. The cottage is warm and has everything you need to enjoy it’s peaceful location. We simply LOVED our stay.
17980547,286734371,2018-07-07,189673610,Mahesh,Lovely county property. The hosts are super friendly We had a great time at Martinsell Cottage ..
17980547,291499752,2018-07-16,30513683,Lina,"I highly recommend Marijan and Pete's Martinsell Cottage. The place was big, clean and  had everything we you could possible need.
Marijan gave us great recommendations on places to eat, to visit, best scenic roads, and was very helpful every step of the way.
My favorite part of the holidays spent in the Barossa was the tour around this property, we fed the sheep and the alpacas, had a walk around the vineyard and heard the amazing history behind this beautiful property.  There is no money that could pay to make up and go for a walk around Martinsell Place, I completely love the property and would love to go back."
17980547,298044842,2018-07-29,22671174,Kalyna,An amazing weekend away in the most perfect place. I feel so rejuvenated and will definitely be returning.

17980547,329453332,2018-09-29,76734026,Crystal,"The Martinsell Cottage sits alongside Martinsell Manor. Both are listed on Airbnb although the cottage is where we stayed, due to our more modest budget! We found it to be of great value and the hosts were wonderful - Marijan even took us on a tour of the grounds and manor, which was very interesting. Marijan and her husband Peter are meticulously recovering and renovating the manor and other parts of the property.
The cottage is clean and pleasant. The kitchen is fully functional and comes with tea, coffee and basic breakfast supplies. The bathroom is clean and large, and the water is hot with reasonable water pressure. So lovely to have a fireplace in the lounge room also! While there are no facilities for babies, Marijan was more than happy for us to bring our 3 month old, and we just brought our own portacot.
The Martinsell Cottage is a convenient and comfortable base for exploring Barossa wineries by car, and we would definitely stay there again!"
17980547,335681581,2018-10-12,208125068,Carol,"Amazing place.  Quiet, slightly out of the way but close to every thing you need in the Barossa.  Lie in bed in the morning and only here the animals, birds and bees.  Huge place from two people to six, would be great place for large family with kids also.  Tour of the property is a total added bonus.  What has been achieved in two years is mind boggling.  Conserving all that history!  I will be back."
17980547,337610837,2018-10-17,1249619,Shirley,We had a lovely stay at the cottage. Great communication and hosting from Marijan and Peter. Would love to be back.

17980547,341414660,2018-10-26,15269551,Michael,"Fantastic rural location deep in the Barossa vineyards. Peter & Marijan were lovely hosts & gave some great advice about wineries, etc. Very interesting main house, stunning grounds and nice to meet & feed the Alpacas. Would love to have stayed longer."
17980547,345374072,2018-11-04,2404278,Alicia,we loved our stay in this beautiful old cottage. lovely rural propery with sheep bleating. good base to explore barossa and adelaide hills. Marian was a warm and generous host and gave aus a tour and history of the property.

17980547,354476217,2018-12-01,34181114,Kiaran,"We stayed for two nights in Marijan and Peter's cottage on their very scenic property.  The cottage itself was extremely comfortable, clean, and well equipped.  Marijan was a perfect host, meeting us on arrival (and very flexible when we changed our arrival time late in the day) and giving us a very interesting tour of the property, including the manor house, fitting in with our schedule to do so.  We had some marvellous meals in the cottage, prepared in the well-equipped kitchen.  When a (rare and brief) power cut, caused by an intense electrical storm, threatened one of our dinners Marijan came over straight away and helped us with setting up a BBQ.  It was an excellent and restful stay in a beautiful part of the country."
17980547,361133254,2018-12-22,69859090,James,"Quiet, relaxing hub for visiting the Barossa."

17980547,368746803,2019-01-07,108297669,Carolyn,"This was the place we just couldn't get enough of, even after 5 days there. Peter and Marian are such good folks, very accommodating hosts, and full of helpful tips for what to do and see.  You basically will have your own country estate, complete with a spacious house, a small flock of sheep amongst the enormous red gum trees, the occasional kangaroo, and two friendly alpacas. The furnishings in the house are simple but quite adequate. The house itself and the other buildings on the property are lovingly restored from their early days, and are wonderful. It's out of town and up in the hills, but still an easy drive to shops, wineries, etc. The more rural setting added a lot to its appeal for us. We loved it!"
17980547,411551885,2019-02-12,1625715,Katherine,"The cottage is an amazing space that is just perfect as a base to explore the Barossa valley. The cottage has everything you need, and is consistently styled in the 1970’s theme. The kitchen is fully equipped, and there are plenty of blankets for cold nights. It was just the two of us staying, but the space can comfortably fit three generations with the three great bedrooms and multiple bathrooms. The views on the property are stunning. We were able to walk around the property, even to their vineyard which was so great. There’s lots of amazing animals on the property too, and you can spy sheep, alpaca, and kangaroos from the cottage. The location is totally private, and yet conveniently located to cellar door locations for making the most of the region. We also got a tour of the manor, which is suited for a very luxurious stay. I would highly recommend it, and would come back here again"
17980547,424508420,2019-03-17,113297799,Barry,"If you want to escape to a peaceful oasis at the end of busy winery and township touring, this is just the place to stay. This comfortable, spacious cottage, nestled among ancient gums and towering pines is a perfect, economical  refuge with wildlife, vineyards and livestock within metres of the door! A place of very interesting Australian history and a chance to witness great work-in-progress on the nearby stone buildings by the hosts. Don't miss this!"
17980547,425751767,2019-03-19,23578858,Julie,Martinsell Cottage is in a lovely setting which is peaceful and quiet. Marijan and Peter are friendly and helpful and the cottage has everything you need. It was a perfect base for our Heysen Trail walks not too far from Williamstown or Tanunda. It was lovely to look over Martinsell Manor and see all the work they have done there. We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay.
17980547,442186732,2019-04-23,62045796,Jane,Great place to stay in the Barossa if you love country and farm animals. Great host too and we really enjoyed our stay.
17980547,444339358,2019-04-27,10784983,Tim,"A great place to get away from it all. Our kids loved feeding the sheep and thinking they were farmers for a few days. Peter and Marijan were lovely, helped us out with local tips and showed us around their property. The house decor is unashamedly straight from 1982, but everything works and it is part of the charm. Very scenic property and outlooks, it really does make you shift gears while you’re there. Enjoy!"
17980547,453438473,2019-05-15,141436802,Theodore,Martinsell cottage is a hidden treasure in every way. Magnificent property quiet and private very relaxing.  Comfortable bed lovely warm wood fire. The tour of the farm premises is very worth the time. We can recommend this accommodation.

17980547,547787485,2019-10-16,170994825,James,"Very lovely place and host. Warm greeting was great, tour of the property. The cottage has a really awesome ambiance and feel to it, really thoughtful decoration but also practical. 

Fire place was really cozy and the beds were very nice looking and comfortable. 

Classic cottage that I know will be enjoyed by many! And peter and Marijan were more than lovely and very helpful in helping us experience as much of the area as we could!"

17980547,627738938,2020-06-04,70321192,Juris,"Very welcoming hosts who have taken on the restoration of a historic property.
The cottage was very comfortable and warm during some very chilly winter nights. The property is set in the quiet country side of the Barossa Valley and close to walking trials but still within close proximity to all tourist attractions and wineries. The best of both worlds."
17980547,628414736,2020-06-08,196922963,Pierre,A lovely place situated on a huge farm.   Perfect for autumn - surrounded by oaks and eucalypts with a large combustion heater in the lounge room.   A serene get-away that is ideal for couples and families.
17980547,635276273,2020-07-05,171047700,Nicky,"Such a great time away, was a cold July weekend but the cottage was warm and cozy. Beds were so comfortable. Our kids really enjoyed the farm and didn’t want to leave. Peter and Marijan were so nice and thoughtful. Marijan even brought a tub of LEGO down for my kids to play with one night and supplied some froot loops for them - they were wrapped. We also enjoyed exploring their property and were totally in ore of their magnificent homestead and tranquil gardens. It was like nothing I have seen before. They have put so much work and heart Into their property and it really shows... Hope to return for another visit in the future. I can definitely recommend."
17980547,636049896,2020-07-09,153182947,Andrew,Such wonderful hospitality in a glorious location. Highly recommend.
17980547,637048645,2020-07-12,66713642,Jules,"Martinsell Cottage is a wonderful place to stay. Warm log fire, games and videos, well-equipped kitchen and plenty of comfortable beds made it a perfect place for a family of 6 adults to stay. The location is divine - set among gorgeous trees and surrounded by sheep, lambs and alpacas. Marijan was a lovely host who made us feel very welcome and  showed us around the manor garden and property, imparting the local history to us. The Heysen trail is close by. The rest of the Barossa easily accessible. We wish we could have stayed longer. A really lovely place to stay. Thank you!"
17980547,637973211,2020-07-14,352258343,Joanna,Highly recommend for a family holiday.  Baby lambs just gorgeous!  Billy and Stirling the Alpaca's also need to get a mention!  Cozy cottage and breath-taking scenery!
17980547,638846554,2020-07-17,272942924,Jenny,"The setting is peaceful and private, the beds are exquisitely comfortable & we highly recommend Peter & Marijan’s Airbnb."
17980547,642455309,2020-07-26,92045038,Catherine,Fabulous 1901 cottage in a beautiful area of SA. Hosts were welcoming and promptly responded to all questions prior to our arrival. We would definitely stay there again.
17980547,645480224,2020-08-02,127725283,Michael,"Amazing grounds and hosts. Marijan had great information about the Barossa and surrounds. The cottage was very spacious and homey, which made our weekend very pleasant. Highly recommend staying at Martinsell cottage if you want a weekend to remember."
17980547,648504346,2020-08-09,195580428,Erin,"Absolutely wonderful stay! The photos don't do justice to how quiant and beautiful the cottage property is. Loved seeing the sheep and little lambs roaming around and the fire was great. Great communication with Marijan. Would love to stay again, perfect little getaway."
17980547,656218063,2020-08-25,49577128,Karen,"Beautiful grounds, lovely cottage with friendly greetings from the hosts throughout our stay."
17980547,659262662,2020-09-01,356456703,Eleanor,A great place to have a quiet peaceful break from the stresses of liife
17980547,663455742,2020-09-12,363035887,Michael,"It’s a beautiful historic place on a beautiful piece of land. Marijan has a lot of knowledge of both the area and the property itself. The cottage is a repurposed old shearing shed which is great. The amenities are simple and the overall aesthetic of the inside is a bit rustic, however, you can see this clearly in the photos and at this price point you can’t be beaten. The oven takes quite some time to preheat but it is fully functional. The animals are very cute too. You will love this place."
17980547,664972690,2020-09-16,163720830,Jenn,Outstanding property and location! Nothing to fault at all! Come and enjoy...you will not be disappointed...Jenn
17980547,667922735,2020-09-26,107586837,Mrunal,Highly recommend! Waking up amongst the alpacas and sheep in that setting was amazing!
17980547,671403680,2020-10-05,225307887,Rob,"Very special thanks Marijan and Peter for your friendly hospitality, with your welcome, presentation of the spacious cottage, and thoughtfulness of a bonfire & BBQ - a great evening!  And providing us with a beautiful 'farm-stay' and gateway into the magnificent Barossa region for 5 superb days / nights of activities.  We will be back!  Warm regards, Rob & guests"
17980547,672255818,2020-10-08,370789391,Monica,"The cottage is the old shearers quarters from the early 1900s. I love old architecture! The quarters were wonderfully cosy like staying at Nanna's. Everything was clean, tidy, comfortable... warm! We loved having the fire going as it was the last traces of Winter. The sounds of the sheep during the night was magical. We hope to come back and explore some more another time."
17980547,700728880,2020-10-16,147604557,Maria,"This place is marvellous but if you have been reading the reviews you already know this.  Please note there is no Wifi and the signal comes and goes.  But we managed very well.  Please note that at the gate that you have to open and drive through, there is a cattle grid.  For those a little unsteady on their feet you have to be very cautious.  When we were there (October 2020) many of the wineries were closed, some only opened on weekends and some that were open charge a fee for tasting, supposedly because of extra precautions that have to be taken due to Covid (at least that was what one winery told us).  Not certain this is the real reason.  I get the feeling that, unlike McLaren Vale that doesn't usually charge for tastings, this is the go in the Barossa.  So plan well.  Overall it was a wonderful stay enhanced by unexpected little treats.  It is certainly great value for money."
17980547,704955741,2020-10-30,26138808,Courtney,"Amazing location, tranquil, peaceful and loved having the sheep and Billy and Sterling nearby!"
17980547,706503565,2020-11-03,136858364,Sharon,"This cottage is in a lovely countryside setting.  The owners were happy for us to walk anywhere on the property, including through their beautiful garden area.  The cottage itself is comfortable and spacious and there are sheep and alpacas on the property.  Peter and Marian are friendly hosts who are great custodians of the history of this special place."
17980547,707299995,2020-11-08,164698052,Sarah,Very friendly hosts who are full of local knowledge. The cottage is fantastic and definitely in the 1970’s theme which is awesome.
17980547,708401277,2020-11-12,283102985,Rob,"We had an absolutely lovely time at Peter and Marijan's place. The flat is spacious, comfortable and with a superb view from each window. It rained a bit while we were there, but that didn't matter as we were perfectly happy to spend the time inside.
Peter and Marijan met us on arrival, filled us in on the local area and Marijan later took us on a tour of the garden. The property has an abundance of land on which to walk and just hang out amongst the trees, and the towns of Williamstown, Lyndoch and Tanunda are just a short and beautiful drive away.
If they'll have us, we'll be back at Peter and Marijan's in the not too distant future.
Highly recommended."
17980547,709323708,2020-11-16,58546889,Johanna,Martinsell Cottage is lovely and the hospitality is great. Perfect location to explore Barossa Valley.
17980547,713592168,2020-12-05,374260117,Amanda,"We absolutely loved our weekend away. We explored the garden took multiple photos of the beautiful buildings. Explored nearby the old school house on the edge of the forest and the heysen trail. If you love places steeped in history you’ll love this place. Thank you to Marijan and Peter for your ease in booking, the clean space and the sharing of the proud history. You’ve done a marvellous job with it all."
17980547,715030443,2020-12-12,83640011,Nicola,"The Martinsell property was beautiful - the big old gums, free ranging animals, beautiful manor and gardens. 
The cottage itself was comfortable, clean and had lots of extra touches that make it very homey. We enjoyed reading about the history of the place, and the kids loved the bridge to the entrance! 
Thanks for having us "
17980547,715814367,2020-12-16,128200958,Kacee,Breathtaking spot. The cottage is so charming and felt so comfy. The gardens were beautiful and it was incredibly peaceful being here. Our hosts were so kind and lovely and extremely knowledgeable about the history of this beautiful site. 5 Stars!!
17980547,717976246,2020-12-24,251061256,Ulises,"Peter and Marijan’s cottage is located in a beautiful property where you can choose to be based to visit close by wineries, or just stay for as long as you want and unwind by reading a book, observing their sheep and alpacas or walking around. Totally recommended, and both of them will be up for a chat and give both local tips and extensive background on the region if you ask them :)"
17980547,719911489,2020-12-30,350256152,Peter,"A lovely place to stay, with all the comforts of home. Beautifully quiet setting with friendly sheep and alpacas. Very convenient to Barossa wineries and cafes, but a world away from them. Highly recommended."
17980547,721806366,2021-01-03,26228839,Phoebe,"The cottage was absolutely lovely and perfect for our family of 8 (including 2 young kids). We spent a fantastic few days touring the Barossa Valley wine region and the cottage was in a great location. Marijan met us upon arrival on the first day and gave us a great overview of the area and some very helpful tips. Throughout the stay, she was very accessible for any questions we had and the check out process was similarly seamless. We had a great experience and we would highly recommend staying in the place and look forward to revisiting in the future!"
17980547,722475775,2021-01-07,376572250,Donna,"We recently enjoyed a two night stay at Martinsell Cottage. Peter's welcome was warm and genuine and Marijan responded promptly to the few inquiries we had during our stay. Martinsell Cottage is a charming stone building that sits beautifully in its rustic environment.  And as you look further into the distance, the scenery really is lovely.  The sheep and alpacas add to the idyllic rural picture. The cottage is comfortable and the air-conditioner in the living area assured we were toasty warm in the unseasonably chilly summer weather.  We set up nibbles on the front porch (it's small space but a bit of a sun trap and quite sheltered from the wind - worth the effort) and spent a couple of restful hours enjoying wonderful local produce and wines, chatting and watching the animals quietly move about.  We principally used the cottage as a base to explore the local area.  Tanunda is a pretty half hour drive away.  So many place to see.  I can thoroughly recommend Gomersal Wines on Lyndoch Road (a lucky stop despite the premises normally being closed on Tuesdays - the host, Gaby is a delight) and Fino Seppeltsfield.  All in all a lovely stay."
17980547,723590673,2021-01-11,56457161,Amanda,Comfortable self contained cottage away from the big house with a lovely vista.  Peter and Marijan are very welcoming and friendly and happy for guests to wander in their lovely gardens.
17980547,724502339,2021-01-16,13047637,Miranda,Inviting and private. Homey and a great escape. Worked well for us as a young family. Accommodating owners.
17980547,725729127,2021-01-21,144060207,Angela,"Such a lovely old, historic place to relax and unwind. Marijane and Peter helped with local knowledge and showed us around the beautiful property."
17980547,729771131,2021-02-07,105776485,Sienna,"Peter and Marijan's place was definitely our pick of the bunch when staying in the Barossa region - with good reason! They had a beautiful historic cottage in a very convenient location to wineries and restaurants. There were lots of little touches that made it feel extra homely. The property itself was also lovely, a massive amount of land with alpaca and sheep that we loved. Our group of 4 agreed that we could've easily spent more time there. Marijan was very hospitable, lovely to talk to, and had so much excellent local knowledge. We would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a quieter area to stay in whilst visiting the Barossa, without compromising on location."
17980547,735840974,2021-03-01,40358742,Lauren & Paul,Clean and basic. Perfect if you’re looking for isolation.

18276899,159870529,2017-06-11,128665437,Krystal,"What a beautiful little cottage, close to town and local wineries, though their own wines were the best we had! Owners were very thoughtful and accommodating. Highly recommend to stay! "
18276899,161930403,2017-06-19,134909231,Tony,"From the get go Cynthia was a fantastic communicator. Fire place was lit prior to our arrival and a lovely breakfast hamper and some chocolates to settle us in. The location is absolutely spot on. Smack bang in the middle of some of the best wineries in Australia. 
We will definitely be back. 
Thanks again Rolf and Cynthia. "
18276899,166249614,2017-07-03,46810152,Daniel,"Where to start? The place was beautiful, cosy and had everything we need for a perfect long weekend. The fireplace was roaring by the time we got in, and the beds were super comfortable and warm. The kitchen was well stoked with some local produce and we loved our complimentary bottle of red.

The house itself is within walking distance of at least three fantastic wineries (Peter Lehman, Langmeil & Dave Franz) with Cynthia and Rolf's winery (Rolf Binder) only being a short drive up the road (be sure to also check them out!).

Rolf and Cynthia went above and beyond to show us a great time in the Borossa, with winery and dinner recommendations only ever being a text away.

Thanks again for an amazing long weekend, we are already planning our return."
18276899,189798955,2017-09-03,86856652,Jo,"A lovely weekend in the Barossa! Cynthia was so helpful and welcoming, providing lots of information & recommendations for the surrounding area.

18276899,197783065,2017-09-27,151222301,Barry,"An exemplary place to stay whilst in the Barossa, everything needed is in the house. Loved time on the verandah and in front of the fire. Cynthia kept in touch with us once booked and ensured a perfect stay from start to finish. Thoroughly enjoyed a wine tasting with her at the cellar door and we look forward to a return visit to Hanisch House and Rolf Binder wines. Thank you Cynthia and Rolf."
18276899,205848522,2017-10-23,39544636,Jo,"Rolf Binder accomodation was amazing. We stayed at Hanisch Haus & it was basically perfect. Very cute cottage with everything we needed, very close to wineries & quite close to town. The cottage was very clean, the breakfast provided were more than enough & thoughtful. Thoroughly recommend !!"
18276899,213746956,2017-11-22,120317174,Richa And Ritin,"The Cottage is beautiful and very cozy. Its centrally located at the same time secluded as its towards the end of road. The wine by the host was excellent , the food was well stocked and the kitchen has all amenities. The communication was great. You actually go back in time when you live there , would recommend for someone looking for that experience."
18276899,253556155,2018-04-15,52305035,Caro,Lovely house in the Barossa valley on the estate of wine makers (Rolf Binder) whose complimentary bottle and great breakfast material awaited us. A wonderful place with lots of charm and a working fire place. Well existed and likely cozy and warm in cold weather.
18276899,280757859,2018-06-24,124641721,Tara,Our stay at Rolf and Cynthia's house was superb!  We were welcomed by the fire already going and a great bottle of Rolf Binder wine which was enjoyed over our stay.  The breakfast supplies were plentiful and more than enough for our two night stay.   The house was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable.  The location was excellent and walking distance to some great wineries (including Rolf Binder of course)!   We had a great time and would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Barossa.  Thanks Rolf and Cynthia!

18276899,422391701,2019-03-11,68139100,Bonnie,"What a wonderful home, oozing country charm, right in the heart of the Barossa Valley. Cynthia was AMAZING to deal with. We only ever needed to travel a maximum of 12 minutes to visit the many wineries, produce markets, farms etc. in the area! The breakfast provisions provided were both generous and delicious. And the Rolf Binder winery is a must visit - great pizza, Shiraz, Reisling...! We will certainly be back. Thank you Cynthia and Rolf."
18276899,522315606,2019-09-02,50019247,Barbara,Beautiful house in a lovely part of the barossa super close to some of the world’s best wineries.
18276899,550573501,2019-10-19,3202311,Trevor,A brilliantly comfortable step back in time. A 1950s house with modern facilities retaining all the style of its time. Worth a major detour to enjoy this opportunity.
18276899,584331622,2019-12-29,100986742,Heath,Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful home.

18798879,249223142,2018-04-01,15615457,Cassandra,"This historic apartment is beautifully furnished and in an absolutely perfect location - a quiet street a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston.  
The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed, including a Nespresso machine and thoughtful touches like Lindt chocolates. Mark replied to all messages quickly, check in was a breeze, and we loved the warm welcome from Mark's 3 small and friendly dogs each morning. We loved staying here and would definitely stay again next time we are in the Barossa. 
We were here for a wedding so didn't have a lot of time for exploring but would highly recommend the Barossa Farmers Market for breakfast on a Saturday."
18798879,330712327,2018-10-01,61475070,Denise,"1851 @ Hill House was such a wonderful experience.  From the minute we confirmed our booking, Mark was welcoming, attentive and so helpful.  From restaurant suggestions to offering to confirm bookings, nothing was too hard.  Check in was a breeze and we loved the attention we received from not only Mark, but his three gorgeous and friendly dogs.  1851 is a gorgeous and very cosy cottage, with so much history and character.  Mark has fitted out the cottage beautifully.  Tucked away in Angaston, we loved that it was only a short drive from the wine trail.  
When Mark discovered that Riesling is my go-to wine, he immediately offered to organise a wine-tasting with RieslingFreak (a MUST DO if you're in Tanunda) and even organised transport to the cellar door.  
Mark also recommended a meal at FermentAsian - another ""must do"".  As it was the long weekend, the degustation menu was on offer and wow - what an experience.  An extremely impressive wine list so Mark's advice to leave the car in Angaston was a good call!  
It's worth noting that Angaston is much quieter than other towns in the Barossa so a car is essential and take note of opening hours.  We were there during a long weekend and a lot of places were closed entirely or early.
A wonderful weekend... and we'll definitely be back!"

19817750,200853324,2017-10-07,150690112,Rita,"Great location to visit the Adelaide Hills, Eden Valley and Barossa Valley. The house is in a quiet location and easy walk into Mt Pleasant main street. The house was immaculately clean and tidy with plenty of room for a family or two couples with all the conveniences of a well set up house. The host provided timely updates before and after our stay. Thankyou Maureen for sharing your lovely house and garden."
19817750,205866136,2017-10-23,32545590,Raeleen,"Beautiful home, so welcoming, elegant and spotlessly clean.   Spacious bedrooms and living areas.  Highly recommend a stay with Maureen."

19817750,216446186,2017-12-03,157598258,Tamara,"Very calming, stylish and relaxing. A very very quiet town with a supermarket 10mins drive away, you will love the simple layout of the house allowing couples of families to relax. 

Perfect for a glass of wine on the patio watching the birds nestle in the trees. 

Bring your own food and drinks to cook up a storm in a kitchen that has everything you need. 


The house is in the main street but some trucks are the only noise you’ll hear. 25mins to Barossa - such an easy drive. We loved it - I’m sure you will too!"
19817750,222872854,2017-12-31,7825490,Barbara,"Maureen was an excellent host, quick and clear with communications. The house is very stylish  and spacious.

We particularly loved the extra special touches such as beautiful linen, great toiletries  and small pantry items to use such as oils and spices etc. My daughters loved the fact that there was a cupboard filled with puzzles, games and paper for drawing.  Mount Pleasant is nicely situated in the Barossa to explore many towns and enjoy the sanctuary of a quiet country town.  We would love to stay again sometime and make it to the farmers market held on a Saturday morning.  Thanks once again."

Having family over from Sydney and being able to show off what South Australia has to offer was incredible and to be able to do that from this gorgeous house was just the icing on top! Hospitality was outstanding, with milk, eggs and bacon awaiting us in the fridge on arrival too!  Couldn’t have asked for better and would 10000% recommend Maureen’s home to anyone else looking for a lovely getaway. "
19817750,280749072,2018-06-24,186724858,Chantelle,"Maureen's place is a stunning open living cottage house. The property has some stunning surroundings and the house it's self has been decked out in the best of brands for appliances, towels etc. the pictures certainly don't do the house justice. It has been the best property we have ever stayed at."
19817750,290116076,2018-07-14,159904293,Gulcan,"What a beautiful property in the quiet town of Mt Pleasant. Great for exploring the SA countryside: 20 mins to the Adelaide Hills and 30 mins to the Barossa Valley. Maureen is a great host, including spices, olive oil and any other essentials you need to cook up a storm in her gorgeous kitchen. Our kids loved the toys, dollhouse, sheep and alpacas. It kept them entertained for hours! The SA countryside in general is very family friendly. We will definitely be back!"
19817750,293207079,2018-07-20,5885361,Casey,"Beautiful location, really enjoyed looking out into the paddocks and watching the sheep roam around. Big house with lots of space, good amenities. Very well stocked kitchen. "

We loved the open family area of kitchen/dine/lounge but also appreciated the separate front loung for those who wanted quiet time for reading a book. Personally we prefer slightly firmer beds, but loved the quality linen. Thanks also for our breakfast provisions. Highly recommended. "

19817750,343212523,2018-10-30,5095952,Kara,"We had the most wonderful time staying in Maureen’s beautiful home.
We were so sad to leave!

We loved waking up every morning to the fabulous view of the hills. It was so spacious and relaxing. I hope we are able to come back and stay again. It was exactly what we needed after a busy few months.

We went on many long drives around the Barossa which was fabulous. It was also nice coming back to the charming cottage at the end of each day.

There is a brilliant local farmers market about a 5 minutes walk from the property every Saturday. We got there around 9am for an amazing cooked breakfast! We definitely recommend that.

Down the road there is a butchers, pharmacy, post office and a fabulous little Cafe with a general store attached. This is all walking distance from the cottage.

We came from abroad and didn’t have any data on our phones so we bought a pocket WiFi from the post office which worked really well.

Maureen’s place is completely charming and definitely a hidden gem."

The perfect base - 1 hour from the city, one hour or so from McLaren Vale region (we did a self drive) and the same for Barossa Valley. Plenty of nearby shops and we tried out the local pub. The house was so beautiful - the garden was the perfect backdrop for a sunset, the kitchen was large and had everything we needed to cook, the rooms were so comfy and beautiful. Maureen also had our first breakfast covered and all the basics in the kitchen."

All the amenities are 5 stars and the little extras like breakfast provisions were such a nice touch. The house was super clean, beds were comfortable and heating was so good for the chilly winter! It's the perfect place for a cozy weekend away in winter, I would love to come back in Spring when the garden is in full bloom and you can utilise the alfresco area for meals. Using the bonfire and wood oven was also a treat, definitely a must for pizza lovers and making s'mores with the kids! Thank you Maureen for this amazing getaway!"

It is beautifully stunning, even down to the small details. Perfect in every way. Sandy the family dog came and visited us which was nice there is also sheep and two horses. (So make sure you take some carrots & apples as they love them). Star gazing on an evening is a must so quiet and totally dark."

We had absolutely everything we could need! Kate is an awesome host, so kind and attentive! We had a great last night with the hosts! Honestly couldn’t ask for anything more!

The tent is stylish in decor and amenities with breath taking views. Which only got better at night when we turned on the fairy lights and little lanterns lit the way to the fire pit area. A wonderfully romantic, very private  unique place to stay.  
Highly recommend it for a special occassion. Hard to beat!!"

The tent and the outdoor area were laid out with the most homely of touches, we loved the decor and the brekky in the morning. Whilst the tent is nicely heated inside, it would be good to bring warm clothes if you want to have dinner outside as it can get a bit chilly! 

Thanks again Kate for such a delightful stay!"

Opening the canvas sides to be able to look out on the farm and animals was just breathtaking. The bathroom was superb with a lovely shower and the most decadent of baths - i recommend relaxing in a warm bath on a rainy day with a glass of local red. The kitchen amenities were also excellent, all you need for a gorgeous stay. Communication with Kate was easy, helpful and friendly. We cant wait to return."

Kate and Garry have put such thought into the set up & the space has everything you could possibly want. Their local knowledge and advice prior to our visit was so helpful.
Truly there is nothing better than waking up to the view over the paddocks each day.

Kate and Garry have done an amazing job styling the Tent and providing many creature comforts that made our stay a pure pleasure."

The property is great  with friendly animals to pat and lovely little nooks to explore. The highlight for me was the glorious big bathtub with views across the property,  bath salts and bombs provided , very spoilt.  You will not be dissapointed, travel around to local wineries or just relax and soak up the ambience.  We will definitely be back thanks Kate for all the special touches that you dont normally recieve at a BnB. In love with Boongarie"

20002372,571247419,2019-11-30,21293379,Jamieson,"The whole experience was pure magic. The tent is even more beautiful in person and Kate & Garry went above and beyond with extra touches. The horses were so friendly! Definitely buy apples of carrots from the market and spend some time feeding them. Pootawanga Wineries just across the way is some of the best wine I've had in South Australia - highly recommend booking a private tasting. 

However, if you're stuck on what to do, just flick Kate a message. She has spot-on suggestions. Overall, one of the best weekends away we've ever had. Highly recommend staying here."
20002372,580644865,2019-12-23,122932784,Holly,Unfortunately we were unable to stay at this beautiful property due to the real threat of bushfires. Kate went above and beyond to communicate with us and make sure we were safe and happy. We look forward to eventually meeting the lovely Kate soon and staying at her beautiful property.
20002372,585577226,2019-12-31,167323640,Emily,"We loved staying here over New Years! Even though it was hot, we found things to do and the aircon was very handy! Kate gave us great restaurant recommendations which we made the most of. Would highly recommend to anyone wanting a quiet escape."
20002372,588663550,2020-01-04,114210809,Georgia,We couldn’t fault our stay at Boongarie luxury tent. You tell that Kate and Garry go above and beyond for their guests and have thought of everything. Finding the fully stocked fridge with breakfast supplies was a special touch. Communication with Kate was friendly and helpful. Providing us with tips for local wineries and restaurants before our stay. 10/10 could not recommend enough!!

20002372,598353596,2020-01-26,35800809,Tom,Amazing accommodation! Definitely a luxury stay and in a beautiful location. The wildlife was a great bonus - we saw a kangaroo plus joey about 50 metres from the tent. Will be recommending to all our friends!
20002372,599689284,2020-01-30,8585417,Elle & Brendan,"This is such a beautiful place to stay... definitely the fanciest tent we've ever stayed in. We felt like we did it all... feed the horses, bath overlooking the land, breakfast alfresco with the sheep, and wine under the stars.

It feels like your own little remote paradise, but beautifully furnished and with touches of hospitality that go above and beyond. (We did end up having some 40+ weather during our stay, so it got a bit hot of the second night with no breeze, but the fan and AC really helped.) We've already recommended to friends."
20002372,600479085,2020-02-01,321971563,Amanda,A wonderful luxury tent - definitely glamping (not camping). Beautiful little touches with breakfast supplies & wine on arrival. Would thoroughly recommend

The thoughtfulness of setting everything  up, leaving breakfast food and a bottle of wine out and also giving us tips and info about the area was better then we could’ve asked for. 100% recommend staying here. Kate and Gary were amazing hosts, and I’ll definitely be back."

It was a fantastic two night, their wasn’t anything extra we needed or could have asked for, was very very comfortable and great way to spend a few days.

Poonawatta wines was especially great with a dedicated path built through the paddock to make it walking distance and an enjoyable afternoon."

Everything at Boongarrie is set out beautifully, it is such a cosy place to stay. They have thought of all the extra little comforts, like the homemade bread, breakfast items and treats which made it extra special. Having the options to spend time in the tent or by the fire was fantastic, with everything ready to go from Kate and Garry made our stay so effortless. Prior to booking Kate offered so many suggestions of local eats and places to visit which meant we could plan our whole getaway and even invite family up for a day trip and lunch in the Barossa. Time well spent in a great part of South Australia!"

Everything has been carefully considered in this luxury tent, including thoughtful breakfast provisions (Garry's homemade bread is to die for), showering supplies, right down to prepared fire pit area. The highlight to our stay would have to be sharing breakfast with our neighbouring horses, your gorgeous and behaved dog Sandy and the copious bird and wildlife. Thank you for establishing this beauty in the bush, we will be back!!!"

Waking up to the birds singing and drinking my coffee watching the horses play and sheep graze was very peaceful. It well exceeded our expectations and I cannot recommend Boongarrie tent enough!"

Alicia was fantastic to communicate with."
20057093,242741013,2018-03-13,26512644,Ned,"Miriam's cottage is a wonderful little house in a quiet street in Tanunda. It was clean and comfortable and there were nice touches such as a bottle of beautiful wine and generous breakfast supplies.
Our pleasant experience was somewhat reduced by the lack of contact re entry details before our arrival and an old electric stove which only had two small rear plates working. That somewhat spoiled our breakfast experiences until we found an electric frypan hidden back under the sink. A drawer full of a jumble of kitchen implements, many duplicated or useless, is more reminiscent of a family beach shack.
A manual re where things are located, garbage arrangements, etc would be really helpful. Wifi is really an essential these days.
It seems that no one has had a really critical look at the house contents, customer relations etc for a long time"

Large lounge room and an enclosed room at the rear to relax & read. The kitchen has everything you need and plentiful and varied breakfast provisions were provided, fruit on the table and a lovely touch which was much appreciated was a bottle of wine with a cheese platter to welcome us which we enjoyed outside on the rear deck.

It was perfectly situated, both for exploring the local wineries and also within Tanunda itself, which is a gorgeous town with lots of beautiful eateries and shops.  The cottage had absolutely everything you could want for a short or long stay, with plenty of character and charm to boot.  The breakfast and cheese plates (featuring local products) was particularly special.  Thanks Alicia!  Hope to be back some time very soon."

A beautiful old house with lots of character and special touches that cater to your every need. The air-conditioning surprisingly is ducted and worked exceptionally well in the hot weather. The lovely character garden has lots of wildlife , with birds splashing in the birdbath in the early morning. The kitchen has all the implements and appliances you need  for cooking. Would definitely stay there again when in the Barossa."

The heating kept us warm as toast on a very chilly winter night. The fire pit was fantastic and a glass of wine while toasting marshmallows was a great way to spend a wintry evening. When the Weather warmed up the rear patio was a lovely spot to enjoy a BBQ overlooking the lush garden. The bedrooms are spacious and the kitchen is small but cosy and adequate for 4 guests   We loved our stay here and left regretfully

The cottage has everything you can think of for a comfortable stay and we were there for 5 nights! Breakfast supplies and a little cheese board were so special and a lovely welcoming touch.

20079805,189800423,2017-09-03,98386375,Tonya,"This house/cottage was absolutely perfect for our weekend away! We were three couples, but could have easily had a fourth couple and no-one would have been on top of each other. It is beautiful inside with every detail considered through to bathrobes in all rooms. It is cozy, elegant and homely all in one. Suzie was an absolute pleasure during the lead up to our visit, and her response times were excellent. We were a 10-minute walk away from the closest winery and a maximum of 25 minutes' drive away from the furthest (that we wanted to visit). Loved it!"
20079805,202771194,2017-10-13,151185714,Richard,"Though we have traveled extensively for over 30 years this was our first Airbnb. Since my wife and I are traveling with our 21 year old son and his friend we felt that a house would be our best option. Overall it was an excellent stay.
The location is a short walk into Lyndoch the first of several ""wine towns"" as one enters the Barossa Valley from Adelaide. There one finds a bakery and  several restaurants (we had good coffee and breakfast at The Table Cafe), a small grocery store (for serious grocery shopping much better off in Tanunda) and a gourmet meat market (great house smoked salmon). The first several of the valley wineries are within a kilometer or so.
The four bedrooms are each quite unique and except for the one off the eating area have individual climate controls off the main system and are each decorated quite differently. The house is quite old but that is much of it's charm. There are many nice touches and features throughout such as two robes with each bedroom, a working fireplace (with plenty of wood) in the living room, dozens of movies, plenty of nice dishes and glasses, a propane barbeque (we did steaks one night). The master bath shower and jacuzzi style tub have a great view of the backyard and surrounding vineyards (though can draw the shades if needed). The backyard is pretty with the smell of citrus trees.
There was a supply of Nespresso pods with milk and a frother so good coffee was at hand!
Really nothing to complain about; overall cozy, plenty of room and a large bright kitchen when we needed to cook.
Suzie supplied us with useful tips before we arranged. We had a minor issue and were able to reach Steve the manager and had it resolved in minutes!
Highly recommended!"
20079805,207266427,2017-10-29,71210558,Liz,Beautiful cottage with gorgeous views....such a warm & relaxing space...
20079805,208313945,2017-11-01,48983705,Pip,"Fantastic spacious house, ample parking. Suzie was so quick to respond to all enquiries and was flexible with check in/out times. Well set up house with lots of amenities like coffee pods, condiments, milk etc. highly recommend."
20079805,211457320,2017-11-12,64694228,David,"Beautiful character house, the nicest we've ever stayed in. Was walking distance to the towns cafes and pub. Is a short drive to other parts of the Barossa. Really didn't want to come home!"
20079805,214913835,2017-11-26,82417544,Prue,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It is absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail and all the little extras are fantastic, but it is the house itself that is just amazing. Suzie clearly has a passion and flair for interior decorating. We were 5 women on a 'girls' weekend and we when we entered the house we just were blown away by how beautifully it was decorated. And spotlessly clean. The rooms are huge, the 5 of us each had a large comfortable space and the living areas are also big and really welcoming. Great vibe to the house. Having 2 bathrooms was also good! Fresh crisp sheets, thick fluffy towels and bathrobes. Sitting on the back deck gazing at the lovely garden with the vineyards stretching behind was just what you want from a Barossa escape. Yet you have the convenience of a bakery and IGA in walking distance up the road. I will be telling everyone I know this is THE place to stay in the Barossa.  Was really convenient for everything we wanted to do there. Made our weekend away really special staying here,"
20079805,216443546,2017-12-03,110198397,Anna-Lisa,"Such a beautiful home, loved it"

20079805,230317104,2018-01-28,1016912,Stanley,"This lovely cottage was exactly as described and as appeared in pictures.  Lovely garden out the back.  Suzie was very responsive and sent through a list of things to do and places to visit as soon as the booking was confirmed.  Suzie was also very accommodating with check-in and check-out time.  We were there during a very hot weekend.  The air-conditioning was very powerful and cooled down the house very fast.  The kitchen was also stocked with all the necessary amenities.

I must say there isn't all that much in the town of Lyndoch, although it served its purpose as a base to discover the wineries in the Barossa Valley."
20079805,246696685,2018-03-26,118619193,Wendy,We travelled from Brisbane to the Barossa for a 60th Birthday weekend.  Suzie's place was perfect for the four couples with lots of space.  The house was full of the most amazing knick knacks. The outside area and surrounding gardens were beautiful overlooking the vineyards.  Everything we needed for our celebratory weekend.
20079805,253551832,2018-04-14,57568886,Nikola,"Great location,comfortable well presented cottage with fire place that made our evening vine and cheese plate unforgettable experience .We loved our stay in  the cottage and Barossa Valley."

20079805,301885232,2018-08-05,46832193,Candice,"We had such a lovely time celebrating Mums 60th! The gorgeous house is perfect for a family get away, it's inviting, warm and cozy. It's our second time visiting but was Mums first, she was blown away by the decor and really wanted to move in! Absolutely loved staying and we will definitely be back!"
20079805,309842240,2018-08-19,83246162,Ian,"Such an amazing property. Would be great for kids, young families or couples wanting to get away.

"
20079805,326706468,2018-09-23,42156761,Castiel,We had a fabulous stay at Azalea Cedar Rose. We stayed for two nights to celebrate my 30th birthday and the house accommodated 8 of us very comfortably.

20079805,422351361,2019-03-10,95067285,Sarah,Azalea Cedar-Rose is a charming little cottage and a wonderful base for anyone visiting the Barossa Valley. The cottage is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful homely feel about it. Sparkling clean. Our trip was a girls weekend away - we all live in various parts of the country and rarely get the chance to spend time together without partners and children around! We spent our evenings lounging on beanbags in the gorgeous gardens and enjoying the spectacular scenery each cheese and drinking wine in the lovely quiet of Lyndoch. Suzie was a wonderful host - very accommodating to our needs and so prompt in replying to any questions I had before and during the weekend. The cottage includes lots of hot tips for travellers and Suzie was also kind enough to offer lots of additional suggestions throughout the weekend. We are all already planning another trip for next year!
20079805,433590331,2019-04-07,72818727,Martin,The cracksin the wall just add more character to this gorgeous place.
20079805,441445379,2019-04-22,109402631,Danielle,An amazing house in a central location. Beautiful finishing touches throughout the house made you feel at home.
20079805,467039884,2019-06-10,43533474,Ira,"As described, a cute place. Fire place was great. Beds were a bit squeaky."
20079805,484957566,2019-07-10,199904662,Johanna,"Azalea Cedar Rose is a beautifully appointed four bedroom cottage in Lyndoch, with a sun filled dining room at the back, looking out over a kitchen garden and rolling vineyards in the distance. The house is sparkling clean and each bedroom has its own unique style, from exotic and bold to pretty in pink. We stayed in July and the underfloor heating in the bathrooms were much appreciated along with the wood fire stove and central heating! The meticulous attention to detail was evident throughout the house, from amenities through to decorative finishes. We particularly loved the chalk board on the back of the toilet door with the itinerary of places to visit in the Barossa Valley! We enjoyed our stay here and would highly recommend this gorgeous cottage as a rest stop."
20079805,496741631,2019-07-28,48432022,Dawn,"We stayed two nights at Suzie’s beautiful home. We arrived at night and were able to easily access the house and loved waking up to find the view from back of house over the vineyards. Quite amazing. The house has been finished beautifully with lots of lovely touches which fit in well with the Barossa. It was well located for easy access and the chalkboard list of where to go helped guide our visit. We enjoyed the breakfast, chocolates and port supplied. I would recommend Suzie’s house for a weekend away or a longer stay if you have the time."
20079805,501609521,2019-08-04,161513527,Asha,"Lovely house, warm fire and great touches like electric blankets on all the beds. A great mid-winter getaway!"
20079805,521441828,2019-09-01,273223665,Jessica,Everything at Susie’s place was perfect for our weekend getaway. There was plenty of room inside the house with a beautiful garden area in the back. It is driving distance to the bigger town but walking distance to a few local shops. Ideal for a big group. Would highly recommend.
20079805,525525228,2019-09-08,263333503,Pauline,Azalea Cedar Rose is such a delightful place to stay.  Myself and the other guests were enchanted from the minute we walked in and we thoroughly enjoyed everything about it.  We were 10 people in total and there was ample space for all of us.  The décor is lovely and so well thought out.  It is obvious that a lot of effort has been put into making this place special.  Suzie shared lots of her local knowledge with us which was very useful when deciding what to do while we were in the Barossa Valley.  She was also quick to answer all of our questions.  The breakfast provisions were generous and delicious.  It is fair to say that we weren't left wanting for anything.  I  highly recommend staying at Azalea Cedar Rose and hope to visit again one day in the future.
20079805,561692017,2019-11-09,57479991,Rosanne,"The whole experience of working with Suzie from start to finish went beyond expectations.  She always responded to any questions within a very short time frame and went out of her way to make our experience in the Barossa a most enjoyable time.  I could not recommend staying at Suzie's accommodation more highly.

It was an absolute pleasure working with Suzie and her recommendations for activities were also spot-on.  

Our girls weekend away will be remembered as very special for many years to come."
20079805,564986710,2019-11-17,246733605,Laura,"A lovely house, nicely decorated with lots of nice little touches (coffee and choccies etc). The bath is next level, just a great place"
20079805,642475400,2020-07-26,110268665,Alison,"Well located in Lyndoch. Very quiet, lovely big garden overlooking vineyards and trees. Gorgeous place! Great fire, heating and spa."
20079805,645436442,2020-08-02,142869019,Melissa,We had an amazing stay. Thankyou!
20079805,663498500,2020-09-13,87148345,Rebecca,We had the most amazing weekend away in the Barossa Valley. The cottage is luxurious and homely with so many extra special touches. The home has everything you could need and more. The views in the backyard are serene.
20079805,671756404,2020-10-05,46135553,Trina,"Spotless house, well equipped and great location in Lyndoch. Beautiful view onto the vineyards. Suzie is great to communicate with and is so helpful!"
20079805,722674542,2021-01-08,128924204,Ruth,"The Azalea Cedar-Rose Villa is a beautiful house in the little town of Lyndoch. The house itself is spacious and great for relaxing in the gorgeous garden or snuggling on the comfy couches. Surrounded my pillows and blankets you'll feel like you're floating on clouds. I feel like Suzie has thought of everything to make your stay perfect. 
The house is situated in Lyndoch with an easy stroll to the supermarket, cafes,  the bakery and the pub and just a short drive to hiking and mountain bike trails."
20144446,198906852,2017-10-01,11079424,Megan,"Charming little cottage with fabulous shabby chic decor.  Lovely views from the backyard and a cosy feel inside, complete with fire place in the living room and large spa bath in the bathroom.  The kitchen has everything you need and the bedrooms were super comfy.  Only a short walk down the main street to the shops/cafes/restaurants and easy drive to all the main wineries."
20144446,206998365,2017-10-28,12712074,Cindy,"Jasmine's Cottage is in a tiny sleepy part of the Barossa, however it is very close to Tanunda and Nurioopta and Gawler is not far either. Sensational restaurants to try are Bistro 1918 in Tanunda and St Hugos Vineyard for a degustation lunch. Appellation at The  Louise is another fantastic restaurant but possibly more for a special occasion. Would also recommend Fino at Seppeltsfield for a more casual share plate experience. The Barossa for us is all about the joy of eating great food and the beautiful wines of course and this time was no different. Jasmine's cottage enhanced the experience as it is a charming little oasis to return to each day. Would definately recommend."
20144446,210009287,2017-11-07,42885493,Angela,We loved staying in this cosy shabby chic cottage. It was perfect for our weekend away to the explore Barossa Valley. Great info available in the cottage and some nice little extra touches. Lovely back garden to enjoy a pre-dinner glass of wine in the sunshine and a nice wood fire to keep things warm in the evening. Would definitely come and stay again. Thanks Suzie
20144446,221819270,2017-12-27,156377085,Kathryn,"What an amazing experience, the cottage is beautifully decorated and Suzie’s attention to detail is fantastic. It was a relaxing 2 night stay after a busy Christmas."
20144446,250362429,2018-04-05,105255209,Sandra,Beautiful decor and relaxing back yard.
20144446,281493000,2018-06-25,190417015,Stephanie,"Great location - very close to excellent cellar doors and restaurants.  Suzie is very thoughtful and caters for every need.  The fireplace, heaters and electric blankets made our stay very warm and cozy and the Nespresso pods were a great touch.  The view of the vineyards from the kitchen window is beautiful!
The cottage is spotlessly clean and very comfortable."
20144446,287182205,2018-07-07,115731784,Liz,Charming cottage with nothing left to do but arrive and enjoy.
20144446,288844524,2018-07-11,177954442,Tanya,"Wonderful, cosy place to stay. Beautifully maintained property and it had all we needed for our stay in the Barossa. Air con, wood fire, fully equipped kitchen, separate bathroom and toilet, extra blankets, undercover parking. Suzie has thought of all the little details her guests would appreciate. The view of the vineyards adjoining the back of the property provided a relaxing view from the kitchen window."
20144446,303650086,2018-08-08,13403333,Yiwen,"it is a very lovely two bedroom apartment. Suize is a very thoughtful host and response very fast if you have any questions. She gave us all the good activities to do even before we reached there. And the location of her place is very good, close to good vineyards and restaurants."
20144446,332695316,2018-10-06,186541882,Andrew,What a wonderful place to explore the Barossa. Was so central to the region. Nice and cosy little retreat. Thanks Suzie

20144446,454783809,2019-05-19,76444370,Wayne,cosy comfortable and everything you need for a romantic getaway
20144446,462232694,2019-06-02,262287912,Samara,We loved everything about our stay. Such perfect accommodation for a winter getaway. Everything was thought of and the spa was just amazing

20144446,511804421,2019-08-18,20469445,Aaron,A great little cottage which was perfect for our Barossa getaway. All the amenities  we needed even with a 9 month old.  Everything was great although we just wished we'd stayed linger to enjoynit more. Communication and info on the area was one of the best ive experienced.
20144446,516892696,2019-08-25,177542579,Asha,What a gem Jasmine's Cottage is! Perfect for a relaxing weekend away. The cottage has been styled beautifully with lots of thoughtful additions. Spa bath is amazing! The view is beautiful! Location is perfect. Highly recommend this place.
20144446,541928143,2019-10-06,28132422,Linda,It is a lovely cottage and the location was great for our weekend in the Barossa Valley.
20144446,552104848,2019-10-21,58489573,Jess,"You will not find a better host that Suzie. She was caring, kind, interested and responsive. She shared her local knowledge and gave great tips. But moreover, she so genuinely wanted us to have a good time!
Her cottage is like a little piece of paradise and she has thought of everything! Clean, cosy, traditional, yet has the modern touches. It was so easy to relax, unwind and forget about the rest of the world! 
This is the place to stay and we will be back.
Thank you Suzie - you are a true gem!

20144446,564469440,2019-11-15,120496539,Peter,"Beautiful cottage in an area very central to the Barossa Valley. A fantastic place to stay and will be doing this again, only longer next time."
20144446,574141471,2019-12-07,6723622,Monique,Such a sweet cottage with so many thoughtful touches. A great escape both in decor and practicality! Enjoyed the private back yard and bbq looking out to rolling vineyards. Suzie was wonderful to deal with and I would definitely stay again.
20144446,598772335,2020-01-27,316300023,Rhett,"Well decorated beautiful cottage, will be sure to make a return visit."
20144446,628409901,2020-06-08,164774525,Natasha,What a delightful & cosy little cottage. The kids loved the fireplace & toasting marshmallows over the outdoor fire pit.
20144446,633479893,2020-06-30,240728825,Laura,"Great location, every amenity you could need, cottage is so well decorated and very cosy. We didn't want to leave!"
20144446,655030044,2020-08-23,7733921,Jessica,"There is SO much love in this place, every personal touch you’ve thought of and those you haven’t.

Just a lovely stay and we hope to be back."
20144446,700512039,2020-10-15,249185923,Tanita,"My partner and I had a fantastic stay here for two nights - the cottage is gorgeous with plenty of amenities and the kitchen has absolutely anything you could want during your stay. The hosts were also lovely and very responsive. The location is great if you’re basing yourself in the Barossa, plus looking out over the vines from the bathtub is a real treat!"
20144446,722067038,2021-01-04,45811371,Shelley,"Thank you again Suzie for a lovely stay! It was the peaceful surroundings that we enjoyed & I also particularly loved the Spa bath. We thoroughly enjoyed our time relaxing in the cottage, Netflix was a great touch and the location was lovely. Thank you, Shelley & Nenad ❤️"
20144446,722675517,2021-01-08,101918742,Georgia,Cute little cottage. Very comfy and tidy
20144446,725874832,2021-01-21,7869228,Tara,Jasmine's cottage is a cozy homely stay with gorgeous backyard views looking into the vineyard
20144446,726714484,2021-01-25,51619594,Bernadette,"WOW! What can I say? I could have lived in this place and I could have even eaten off the floor :) Only kidding on that last point. We decided to travel from Melbourne the weekend of 42 degree heat. The house stayed really cool with its aircon. We had port and chocolates, coffee and biscuits, am amazing spa and the views onto the vineyards behind. The wineries were so close, the restaurants at the end of the street and a garden to die for. We'll be back!!"
20144446,728306067,2021-02-01,128508174,Danae,Gorgeous cottage with so many beautiful touches. A real treat to stay here!
20175507,323551002,2018-09-16,74777422,Karinna,"Organisation was great, spaces were fine and clean. Air conditioning wasn’t great in one of the rooms. Decor is ok.. out of date but it is as per the pictures."
20175507,353186078,2018-11-26,107177140,Sophia,Fantastic!
20175507,632682493,2020-06-28,110416499,Dale,"Outstanding venue, great communication, cannot recommend highly enough!"
20524750,281507275,2018-06-25,27682125,Kylie,Wow! The Reserve is even better in real life than in the pictures. Superb location to visit the Barossa. Simone had great communication from day 1 and went over and above with the information provided as well as local hints of where to go and what to see. We didn’t want to leave
20524750,282987006,2018-06-29,3943946,Ellie,"The Reserve is the perfect accomodation for any group looking for a self-catered home with all the mod cons! Warm, inviting & gorgeous views out the back of the home, our group of 7 had a fantastic time staying here. Thanks to Jodie for her fantastic communication during our stay :)"
20524750,309844261,2018-08-19,135477359,Helen,Fabulous home and location! 
20524750,321668765,2018-09-11,44148984,Rachel,"A beautiful property with lovely furnishings and fittings, and in an ideal location to experience the Barossa. Highly recommend."
20524750,325500818,2018-09-20,34809863,Victoria,"We stayed with our family for two nights for our small wedding, which we held in the beautiful gardens. The Reserve was a warm and welcoming place and was so close to great wineries (literally on the same road as many of them) that we even had a chance to visit a few. The fire was going and keeping the place cozy for our arrival which was a really nice touch. The grounds were beautiful - nicer than the pictures and able to be fully enjoyed even in bad weather, through the glass windows at the back. We also really enjoyed making our own pizza and using the pizza oven the night before the wedding :) All necessary equipment was provided. We had hoped to have our wedding dinner outside and although the weather wasn’t kind to us, the glass conservatory/dining area made a beautiful alternative and was more than comfortable and big enough for us all. The host was happy to allow caterers to come in to prepare our meal, and helped us with various recommendations ahead of time. 
The host was extremely responsive to all queries leading up to our stay and promptly responded to an issue with the gas supply on the night of the wedding. Unfortunately the temporary fix for the gas meant that there wasn’t enough for hot water for all 11 guests to shower before leaving the next day, but my impression was that this was unusual and ultimately out of the hands of the hosts, who had arranged for the gas to be replaced early the next day, but the suppliers didn’t arrive. Other than this hiccup - which I’m guessing is very unusual - we had an amazing time at the Reserve and will actually be returning in December with friends which we are looking forward to. I would definitely recommend staying at the Reserve."
20524750,341801247,2018-10-27,64198680,Johnny,"Beautifully situated in the heart of the Barossa. Amazing house/property with an equally friendly host - this is an ideal spot to visit wineries and/or just sit-back and gauze out overlooking the vineyards in our private retreat.
The place is stylishly modern and accommodates up to 12 people comfortably (2 x on stowe-away beds) for a perfect escape. Facilities are ample and there’s even an option to hire a personal chef to utilise the outdoor wood fire oven. 

Would highly recommend staying for a week."
20524750,361135302,2018-12-22,43474783,Katie,"Such a beautiful property with incredible views, gardens, access to the best wineries around and gloriously renovated. Booking was easy and Jodi, the property manager, provided exceptional service throughout. The owners even allowed us a late check-out with no extra charge. The beds were incredibly comfy and the kitchen easily catered for 9 of us self-catering on the first night. The only slight criticism was that the spa did not work. I'd planned the late checkout to give my guests (8 of them) time to enjoy the property and its amenities, which we were paying luxury prices for. However, despite one of the main reasons for booking the property being that there was a spa, it did not work. That being said, Jodi responded quickly, came out to the property (with a bottle of sparkles to apologise for the inconvenience) and attempted to fix it. Whilst she thought she had, unfortunately the spa continued not to work and we all vacated early."
20524750,528854776,2019-09-13,112238620,Frances,It was a beautiful and cozy place. Jodie got the fire going for us before we arrived as I texted that we were cold on Kangaroo Island. Very thoughtful of her. The grounds around the house was lovely and my girlfriends took plenty of pictures there. The location was fantastic as it was a short drive to all the places that we wanted to go.
20524750,537638587,2019-09-29,112772304,Craig,"Amazing place. The setting is perfect. I especially loved the lights in the trees. The info we received beforehand really helped us to make the most of our time. The house itself is gorgeous. Beautiful features, garden, bedrooms everything. It’s worth the spoil!!"
20524750,655014259,2020-08-22,177380872,Jacquelin,"Great place. 
Would stay here again. 
Price of property could be a little more affordable. But we were over all happy."
20524750,705603018,2020-11-01,14031331,Emma,This space is more magical than the photos even suggest. The reserve is just gorgeous and an amazing winery just a stone throw away named Rolf Binder Wines - Highly recommend! We used the pizza oven and made the most of the gorgeous gardens. We will be back!
21481807,463211863,2019-06-03,211428184,Nicole,"Pinecone Ridge is a fabulous place to stay.  Cosy, comfortable and stylish.  Only a short drive from town, beautiful surroundings and we wished we could have stayed longer !"
21481807,467001836,2019-06-09,18697625,Maya,We can not recommend Anne’s place enough. The house has absolutely everything you need and more and the view of the paddock was stunning. We were a group of 8 adults and had a wonderful weekend in Angaston for a friend’s 30th.
21481807,471068280,2019-06-16,1629066,Angela,"We were a group of 6 friends that stayed at Anne's over the weekend and had the most amazing time in this home. The photos do not do the place justice, not only does it feel extremely homely, but a lot of thought and details have gone into the furnishings. All of your needed amenities were provided, plus additional little touches that were an added nicety such as board games, basic cooking amenities, soaps etc. 

We will 100% come back to stay here again!"
21481807,474230305,2019-06-23,100727498,Jeremy,"Of all my stays with Airbnb, this was the best. Anne's attentiveness was evident right from the moment I booked. The home and location are superb. Just a glorious place to stay and enjoy and Anne was on top of everything and her attention to detail was fantastic. A highly recommended option for the Barossa Valley."
21481807,478353971,2019-06-30,31884657,Donna,"Pinecone Ridge really has it all, wineries at your doorstep, a friendly and accommodating host and little touches that made the stay so much more enjoyable, the bread kit was a hit as was the wine, thank you!  5 stars from me and my guests!"
21481807,482698511,2019-07-06,36606675,Scott,"Pinecone Ridge is simply amazing. It’s tucked away from the Main Street is Angaston which is perfect and provides a home away from home. Waking up to a sunrise, birds chirping and a stunning view was the perfect way to get the day started. Anne’s property has everything you need, you literally don’t need to leave, except maybe to grab some of the amazing wines from the local vineyards. Comfy beds, couches, well equipped kitchen, toasty fireplace, stacks of LEGO to keep your creative mind going and very thoughtful attention to detail across the entire place! This is the type of place that you’ll want to come back to time and time again, and we definitely will be back! 
Thanks for everything Anne. We loved your suggestions and your place! See you again soon!!!"
21481807,488369455,2019-07-15,96639433,Adam,"We stayed here , with two families and had an amazing time (4 adults, 3 kids) The place is perfect for that . We were there in the absolute depths of winter but stayed incredibly warm with cozy fires and a few reds of course. There’s also plenty for the kids to do with games, LEGO and amazing outdoor spaces . Anne as our host was amazingly attentive. Highly recommend staying here."
21481807,501601721,2019-08-04,6675491,Eldad,"This is a gorgeous place, situated in a quiet location but close to everything. 

A place to come back and relax after wine tasting or stay the while day while drinking, eating and enjoying the view.

Highly recommended."
21481807,507729640,2019-08-12,56091930,Robyn,"Absolutely gorgeous - views, ambience, amenities. Hosts have tbought if absolutely everything. Thank you so much, hope to return we just loved our stay."
21481807,517963948,2019-08-26,27514985,Andrew,This place is stunning. If you are considering it as potential stay place then don't waste time. If it is free then book it. No point writing anything else. It's wonderful
21481807,529468597,2019-09-15,278620681,Jane,A relaxing and well equipped getaway. Not a far drive from all the Barossa has to offer!
21481807,533609792,2019-09-22,34245933,Toby,"The house is very well presented and is in a great location. You can walk into town, but have country views. 
The kitchen facilities are excellent and the wood burning stove warms things up quickly."
21481807,537557295,2019-09-28,13650986,Brant,"Great place for anyone looking to escape the city, with loads of space on the property and gorgeous views. 

On a practical note, the rooms are filled with large, comfortable beds, but lack hanging space for clothes - so travel light and ditch the formal wear."
21481807,543967449,2019-10-09,180426849,Alison,"A lovely property for our family to stay at. Great local tips from owners and great communication, beautiful outdoor and indoor spaces. Plenty of toys for our four and five year old to play with. We also had fun riding the billy cart down the hills.  Beautiful having breakfast watching the kangaroos hopping over the property. I would stay here again."
21481807,551093484,2019-10-19,3720557,Jillian,"We had a wonderful weekend stay at Anne's. She has thought of everything we needed and more! The space is beautifully decorated. We enjoyed waking up to freshly baked bread, the property, and all the local tips on things to do and see. Can not recommend Anne's place highly enough."
21481807,555690526,2019-10-27,125315518,Jess,"This is the perfect house, it has everything you could need and more. It’s on a beautiful 16 acre property, overlooking vineyards and countryside. It has an outdoor fire pit to enjoy the sunset and view. The beds are super comfy and everything feels new. We all had great sleeps! The main bedroom is quite large with its own en-suite. Both showers have rain shower heads with great pressure and heat. We got stuck into a puzzle there is a wide selection ruin of them to choose from along with so many games, dvds and books. Full cooking facilities with things like oil and salt n pepper and some other goodies. It is such a great location for wine tasting and exploring. We have stayed in tununda before but this was much much better. We booked a maxi taxi for the day and they had no troubles picking us up it’s a great way to wine taste without the hassle of a proper tour. We got to choose where and when we went."
21481807,559368785,2019-11-03,28179597,Emily,We had a fantastic time in Anne’s place. The place was in the most beautiful position with stunning views over the valley. The house was very stylishly done with lots of thoughtful touches and extremely well equipped. We would love to stay there again. Anne was an incredibly responsive and helpful host.

An absolutely beautiful place, spotlessly clean, and everything you need right there.  Comfy lounge, comfy beds...comfort everywhere.  Beautifully and tastefully decorated.  Very useful info left by Anne.  Great space for two independent travellers.  Could not fault one thing.  Even had a lovely visit by a local kangaroo in the morning!  Will be back again.  Thanks Anne."

21481807,610661387,2020-02-24,322055,Lana,This house was a dream. Sunlit rooms and well decorated spaces made our stay here unforgettable. The beds were so comfortable! The kitchen well stocked and had everything a cook would ever want. Best toys and books for our kids. we found ourselves bringing wine and food back to the house rather than going to the restaurants. Anne was a great host - superb communication and recommendations tailored to our family. I cannot recommend this house enough. Thank you!
21481807,616165816,2020-03-09,67509346,Mary-Anne,"The home was perfect! Great location, beautiful space with absolutely everything we needed. The Kitchen is wonderfully equiped, loved making the bread overnight as suggested. The bedrooms are beautifully decorated and the beds very comfortable. So many games - our family loved   them.  We enjoyed the reading material too. Great personal touches and thoughtful message. 
Thank you Anne, being able to check in early and out a little later was a bonus we weren’t expecting. A wonderful weekend being able to enjoy the Barossa region and come home to a comfortable home. Highly recommend this accommodation."
21481807,618914389,2020-03-16,81473835,Louise,"Anne’s place had a warm, welcoming relaxing feel for our ladies get away. Pinecone exceeds every expectation. We specifically loved having the fire place, a puzzle and glass of wine to relax too. Her local tips were invaluable!"
21481807,626280821,2020-05-25,51349575,Tom,"A wonderful space for couples or families. Everything about the house speaks of quality and class. It feels like living in family home and not a holiday house. 

On top of this the views and surroundings are spectacular and provide ultimate privacy and peace. 

Will definitely be back."
21481807,655048432,2020-08-23,33281665,Leah,"My sister's an I had an awesome weekend at Pinecone Ridge! It was so clean, warm and cosy. It is such a beautiful spot! Would recommend!"
21481807,660380179,2020-09-04,170662131,Cara,"Faultless! Anne has thought of absolutely everything and the only problem we had was not being able to stay longer!

Pinecone Ridge is such a beautiful, relaxing place to stay. It's decked out with everything you need and there's lots of thoughtful homely touches. There's stacks of good quality books, games, puzzles and dvds. We have 2 young kids and Anne left out boxes of toys, Lego and books for them.

The house is spotlessly clean. The bed linens and towels are beautiful quality. The combustion fire was warm and toasty. The sunsets from up the top of the property are stunning. Netflix and Nespresso were appreciated!

We will absolutely return!"
21481807,665927699,2020-09-20,342005869,Kylie,"Stunning location in the hinterland of Angaston surrounded by trees and beautiful garden. Every window in the house has a gorgeous view and immediately relaxes you. Tasteful decor and creative touches throughout the house, beds so comfortable, all the extras and no need unmet. Really lovely place to stay and generous host, definitely recommend."
21481807,670019588,2020-10-02,25522332,Justin,"We had the most amazing time at pinecone ridge. We were fortunate to experience misty rain and clear skies and both were magical. 

Incredible views and sunsets along with several kangaroo sightings.

The house has everything, games books and magazines along with Netflix to keep you entertained but little things like electric blankets and firewood were a nice touch.

We really appreciated the effort of the host to make our stay special and we’d love to stay at pinecone ridge again in the future."
21481807,671395534,2020-10-04,252711760,Eleni,"We loved our stay here. Anne had a little welcome sign on the counter with a bottle of wine for us on arrival which was a cute touch. The house has a homely feel, plenty of space for the kids to run around on the property, and a view to die for. I would recommend this stay to anyone with kids."
21481807,701350538,2020-10-18,167081420,Paul,"Lovely house, highly

21481807,703130932,2020-10-24,206375170,Cassie,"Pinecone Ridge is very comfortable and exceptionally well equipped. Just far enough out of town to enjoy the peace and quiet, but only a short drive to many wonderful restaurants and cellar doors. We had a great stay and being only just over an hours drive from Adelaide, would love to visit again. Highly recommend!"
21481807,704736699,2020-10-29,181208148,Lauren,An absolutely fantastic Barossa experience at Pinecone Ridge. From the moment you enter the drive expectations are exceeded by this beautiful accomodation.
21481807,705570432,2020-10-31,29002985,Denise,"Stayed here in October, lovely thoughtful touches. We loved the pre set fire, great communication, the wine and of course the very awesome set of instructions on setting the bread maker so that we woke up to warm fresh bread. The electric blankets were great and we loved all the quirky light fittings. Very well appointed bnb, picnic basket, champagne cooler in freezer etc. Loved our stay."
21481807,707270439,2020-11-07,34428215,David,One of the best Airbnbs we have every stayed at around the world. The place has absolutely everything you would want or need to have. Immaculately clean and very comfortable. Anne was very accommodating as we made a couple of requests to make it easier for our 3 year old son. Will definitely come back!
21481807,712097238,2020-11-29,15104435,Kate,"Just came home from a long weekend relaxing at Pinecone Ridge. The house is delightful and to make things even better it is amazingly well set up. I have a “travel box” that I bring along to every AirBnB because most have blunt knives, and a veggie peeler, scissors and can openers etc are not always there. My box stayed tightly sealed for the whole weekend because Anne has thought of and provided everything and it all works. The property is magnificent and we loved watching the storm roll in on Saturday night. I’d love to come back in winter to enjoy nights by the fire. 
Fantastic house. Amazing communication from Anne and it all added to the perfect weekend away. Thanks Anne."
21481807,715656746,2020-12-14,43151628,Yan Dan,"A beautifully appointed house, exactly as the pictures show PLUS a lot more! A great place for a quiet, homely yet luxurious holiday for a romantic getaway or a family with children. Kitchen, bedrooms, laundry, bathrooms, pristine clean and  fully equipped with everything we needed and things that we hadn't even anticipated needing. We will definitely be back to stay again! Thank you Anne."

The house is lovely, in a convenient location with lovely gardens. We really did enjoy our stay.

We needed to contact Anne as the water went off and this was seen to immediately. We would definitely like to stay again in the future.

Thanks Anne and Josh!"

21481807,738723007,2021-03-13,40178546,Emily,"This property was flawless in every way. The attention to detail was one of the very best we have seen in an Airbnb and anyone would be lucky to stay there.  
The views are incredible and we even got to enjoy watching some kangaroos just outside the window as well. The local tips were great, and overall we cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. Thank you Anne and Josh for the beautiful space you have created."
21636564,213754765,2017-11-23,3753624,Gen,"We've travelled the world, stayed in many Airbnb houses and even host our own and I have to say that this was one of the most spectacular places we have stayed. Pembury Cottage in the beautiful Barossa Valley was idyllic...a picturesque historic cottage on the main street of pretty Angaston, walking distance to lovely coffee shops, a yummy bakery, restaurants, lot's of wineries close by (I could go (Website hidden by Airbnb) in the hub of wine/food heaven!) and the home itself was perfection. Kate and Jonathan have really thought of everything, from the quality linen, exquisite (and abundant) breakfast provisions, thoughtful touches that gave you the sense of being in an upmarket, comfortable country home and the rooms were light and warm (we were there when it was cool, but I noticed there were air conditioners, too). Bathrooms sparkling and kitchen like something out of Vogue (we didn't cook in it...too busy drinking wine and eating Italian at Casa Carboni down the road). We went as a couple but would definitely come back with friends as it sleeps 6. Great value and highly recommended!"
21636564,216046711,2017-12-03,160501291,Michael,We very much enjoyed staying in Kate and Jonathan's spacious and tastefully decorated cottage and have no hestitations recommending it to others. The cottage is just a short walk from all the town's shops and eateries and Angaston itself is just a few minutes drive from many Barossa vineyards and the much busier and larger town of Tanunda.

Jonathan and Kate were responsive and check in was simple. Well located to walk to local restaurants or drive to surrounding wineries. Would recommend."
21636564,243721735,2018-03-17,23787397,Verity,"Highly recommend staying at this wonderful home! It has a fabulous location that is walking distance (across the road) to shops, cafes & restaurants. Parking is easy and it’s ideal for families groups. Kate and Jonathan have obviously gone to a huge effort to make the place comfy & welcoming. They went the extra mile and left breakfast and all those things you need on arrival aka. Milk, coffee tea. All the beds are amazingly comfy and huge. 
Anyone looking for a place that is ideally located in the Barossa should should choose this place."
21636564,246134946,2018-03-24,66405052,Sheriee,"Amazing huge king size beds, lovely country feel kitchen and great amenities. Bonus of off street parking too.

The peaceful location, the small touches like the breakfast, fresh milk and bread, the gorgeous shampoo & conditioner, magazines, candles, rugs, comfy beds with divine linen etc. it's all these touches that make a place special and stand out from the crowd.

Walking distance to quaint little village of Angaston, which has some lovely restaurants.  However with this Airbnb it is also possible to cook a wonderful meal of your own as it supplies all the utensils you could need to do this.

Jonathan responded to our message on Day 2 and dropped off more firewood, which was fantastic and very helpful. It’s a great base for the Barossa and Eden Valleys and I would pick Angaston any day over the other Barossa towns. The cottage isn’t cheap but it is well well worth it. Look forward to coming back again in the future."

21636564,554740127,2019-10-26,1852971,Bethany,"Jonathan and Kate's place was perfect for our girls trip to Barossa. The space is beautiful and comfortable, self check in was easy, Kate was responsive about a small issue and also allowed us both an early check in and late check out which was very generous and much appreciated. Angaston is such a pretty town! Great base to explore the Barossa Valley wineries. Thank you!"
21636564,559859324,2019-11-04,10894099,Trudy-Ann,"We had a delightful stay at Pembery Cottage. We arrived on a hot afternoon to find the air conditioning running so the house was cool. 
Generous breakfast provisions had been left and Kate let us arrive early which particularly nice as we were travelling with my elderly parents who struggle with a full day out and about. 
The house is very well located and well equipped. We had 4 extended family members visit for lunch and there was ample crockery and glassware for a group of 8. 
The bedrooms are large, the beds are comfy and we even baked scones for our guests in the country kitchen. 
Highly recommended!"
21636564,561748390,2019-11-10,128198668,Meredith,"Pembury Cottage is a well appointed home with gorgeous rooms. A short stroll into town for coffee and delicious food options, the location is perfect. Would definitely recommend a wine tour with Jonathan as well!"

21636564,588653157,2020-01-04,13287802,Clare,"Pembury Cottage is so sweet. We loved the location, right in the Main Street of Angaston. 
It was just immaculate and had the perfect spaces for our group of 6. The beds were huge and so comfortable & linen spotless. 
The air conditioning heat pumps in all rooms were a bonus with temperatures 45degrees on one of the day’s we were there.
A fantastic wee village to stay in while visiting the Barossa, wouldn’t consider  staying anywhere else. Angaston has the perfect quaint feel of being in the Barossa that we were looking for. We even drove to the Clare valley for the day, only an hour away and it was sensational.
We didn’t cook while we were at the cottage as there were pubs and restaurants just down the road 3min walk. There were all the bits in the pantry left for visitors to use if they did cook.
We even discovered the local gym who invited us in one morning for only $10p/p. Clair was the gym manager. Fabulous lady. Awesome facilities also.
Breakfast cereals, milk and a welcome fresh loaf of bread was a grateful bonus.
I would highly recommend you staying at Pembury Cottage to anyone wishing to have a perfect space in a stunning piece of South Australia. Only 1hr from Adelaide CBD.
Thank you for your Barossa hospitality."
21636564,594585188,2020-01-18,7469261,Cee-Jon,"Jonathan and Kate’s house was the perfect BnB for our weekend trip away to the Barossa. Conveniently located on the main drag of Angaston, access to all the best wineries and eateries is available by private car or taxis. An added bonus is the pet friendliness and we visited with three dogs. The setup was perfect and our dogs (a cavoodle and two dachshunds) were safe and sound whilst we went winery hopping! The house itself is stunning and very comfortable. Highly recommended!"

Check-in was easy and there was excellent communication with the home owner.  The home was very clean,  furnished well, and the amenities were nice.  The home has three large bedrooms and two baths.  Beds were comfortable and the area is very quiet at night.  There is are two living room areas with televisions. There is a large covered patio area to be enjoyed in the mornings with coffee or for the evening meal.  You are close enough to walk to the Main Street in Tanunda for coffee or breakfast.  The kitchen has everything you need for preparing meals.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely book again."

In the heart of region, it makes a great base camp for trips out to the valley and as a base camp it's a warm and welcoming return. Highly recommended."

21884875,467011557,2019-06-10,53974194,Samantha,"Fabulous place, really close to the town and surrounding wine regions, only downside was the hot water didn’t last long, although that could just be a house full of females - long showers galore"
21884875,470116108,2019-06-16,39902119,Barbara,"Very spacious Airbnb with great kitchen and 2 living areas which was great. The ducted heating was awesome. Location impeccable.

The not so good things: small couches in each living area. The house fits 6 people, but 4 of us struggled to fit in on of the couches. A couple of chairs or another 2 seater in the living room would have been great.

The bed in the room at the back of the house was horrendous!! I ended up sleeping on the couch which was much more comfortable.

The place had a feel of stinginess about it - e.g. only 1 toilet paper roll in the bathroom, no paper towel in the kitchen and only 1 tea towel, very few coffee pods (lucky we brought our own!!!), only 1 bedside table in each of the spare rooms (not master bedroom), no bedside lamps, very scratchy old towels. It’s really not hard to invest a small amount in some nice finishing touches to leave a much better impression!

Overall it was ok for a short stay."

As it is, you can't go wrong."

Kitchen was stocked with plenty of cockery and utensils, didn't have any issues finding anything. 
Master bedroom was the biggest room with lots of wardrobe space. Beds were a bit firmer than we're used to but I find that with most places I stay at.

John and Jan went out of their way in welcoming us and showing us around the farm.  The rooms are neat and clean each with an ensuite bathroom and shower.  The common living area is well equipped with the kitchen necessities to prepare your own meals and enjoy each others company al fresco.  The vintage cellar door is rustic and charming filled with local farm prepared jams, jellies, and chutneys, not to mention their incredible wines.  Guests are able to buy local farm products to enjoy like their incredible lamb that we enjoyed.  Our hosts went to the trouble of supplying us with wonderful farm fresh eggs, local bacon, bread and milk, which was a wonderful treat. This historic setting is a true gem and anyone visiting is fortunate enough that the Angas family shares it with the public.  We can't say enough about this wonderful property and delightful hosts."

John and Jan were delightful hosts - warm, welcoming, highly knowledgeable and always looking to help you with advice. The working farm has been in their family for many generations, and John gave us a tour of the property (stunning by the way) before a wine tasting of what they make on-site (some of the best we tried all weekend!). We were even fortunate enough to partake in a grape pressing for the next seasons wine bottling!

The living space/kitchen is an outdoor/open plan arrangement, but really added something special to our stay. And the occasional visit of the two farm dogs was always very welcome!

Without a doubt, we will be returning here in the years to come.
Thanks for an amazing weekend Jan and John!"
22294732,261142432,2018-05-06,17131826,Julie And Dugald,"Hutton Vale is a wonderful Barossa experience. The farm is beautiful with views over vineyards and paddocks filled with grazing sheep. The farm is just like a setting out of Country Style ! Grape vines trailing over rough stone walls,rusty sculptures surprising visitors everywhere you look. The accommodation is very comfortable with lovely bed linen, heating, electric blankets, fresh flowers and clean adequate ensuite bathrooms. Every evening we enjoyed a roaring wood fire  while relaxing in our ""Glamping"" kitchen/lounge shed. The sun streamed in every morning to make this area a cheery place for the breakfast gathering.
Our hosts were so hospitable and welcoming and there were many thoughtful touches around the place to make us feel special and well looked after.  Our evening lamb roast came from Hutton Vale and we also enjoyed a magnificent wine tasting afternoon on the property.
If you have a group of friends that all get along and love red wine ,log fires and relaxed country living I can highly recommend Hutton Vale for a stay."

Lazing in the rustic lounge space with the log fire and games with the kids, no devices, local produce and a bottle of Barossa wine was a wonderful taste of a life once lived. Thanks Jan and John"

The whole experience was exactly what we were looking for in an escape from the big city. Waking up to sheep grazing in the field outside the bedroom door and seeing kangaroos at sunset was very special. The family dogs Alfie & Mac also made us feel like part of the family. Extremely warm, friendly dogs who were always nearby and ready for a pat or play (huge bonus for dog lovers like us!). The main kitchen/dining/living area is fit with everything you could need and is perfect for dinner parties by the fire. Making time to visit the Hutton Vale cellar (located right near the accomodation) for wine tasting is a must - beautiful wines which we enjoyed during our stay. Jan & John went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. We are already planning our return."

22294732,616162854,2020-03-09,2091462,David,"This was the most amazing and unique experience we had in the Barossa/Eden Valley.  Must do's are to do a wine tasting and tour and to buy some home grown lamb for dinner. 

The wine tasting and tour is intensely intimate and you get a real taste of the history and the realities of farming and growing wine grapes. As the family tells you their story you can't help but feel completely immersed in it.  

It will be a challenge to find another place that delivers the same level of hospitality and warmth that we experienced."

Great hostess"
22604785,734360049,2021-02-25,11428964,Jane,"We had a very comfortable stay at Heather’s place. Her property was really clean and we had all the amenities we required... and more!

We loved the historic feel of the property and that it’s old charm and antique furniture had been retained. 

The bed was really comfortable and we slept very well. Breakfast provisions were included, as well as some staple items. We found the office area & supplies a thoughtful touch.

Heather’s communication was excellent, and she couldn’t have been more helpfully. The property doesn’t have wifi, and Heather was kind enough to print out an urgent document for me. She also dropped off some dishwasher tablets when we ran out.

If you are looking for a charming, historic property to stay in, that is convenient to Gawler, wineries and other towns and attractions in the Barossa, you can’t go past Heather’s property."
22604785,734627499,2021-02-27,182846146,Dave,"Perfect, quiet country location, a wonderful property... peaceful, relaxing and all inclusive... lovely, friendly hosts, easy to deal with... overall, a delightful experience, highly recommended!"
22604785,736356899,2021-03-05,186782006,Lydia,Enjoyable short stay in this great space and good location.
22604785,736868945,2021-03-06,65861671,Hanh,From the moment we walked inside Heather's place we were all in awe! It was so incredibly beautiful and it was truly home away from home. The kitchen was amazingly equipped and we cooked breakfast every day and had it in the back yard listening to the birds singing. Evening time was spent with the family again outdoors. It was truly  an honor being entrusted with Heather's gem! I would definitely stay again and again...
22604785,737686947,2021-03-09,356055924,Stephen,This is a great place to stay. Lots  of thoughtful extras greatly located to the Barossa and a short stroll to the local bakery and eateries.
22604785,738771550,2021-03-14,9913699,Therese,"Great location, very easy to access bike track and local wineries. Close to restaurants and a quaint place to stay."

Great location, excellently finished with amazing furniture and fittings. We’ll be back, I’m sure when revisit the Barossa. Thanks again Heather and Gordon"
22636387,362211506,2018-12-25,67128083,Anthea,Wow ! Martinsell manor was incredible! Peter & Marijan were fantastic hosts and so helpful to all our needs. We had the most amazing week and look forward to coming back to stay again hopefully in the next few years. The property and grounds were just beautiful! Definitely recommend Martinsell Manor to anyone wanting to stay in the Barossa region.
22636387,408251704,2019-02-03,111689336,Emily,"AMAZING! Peter and Marijan were great hosts, so welcoming and helpful! the manor was so beautiful and we were honored to be able to stay here, it has been lovingly restored to a high quality. It really takes you back in time through a wonderful building with so much heritage. walking up the stairs from the pool made you feel like a princess.
Thank you again and we will be back"
22636387,422371030,2019-03-11,226795254,Andrew,"We stayed at the Martinsell Manor for our 10year Anniversary.

Marijan and Peter have worked hard to restore the lower level to its former glory. 
They've done a wonderful job keeping true to history - from the beautiful rugs to the beds to the decor. 
Amazing effort - it really shows.

Its a wonderful place to stay - quiet, relaxing and private. 
A pool all to yourself for the hot days, a garden and near by pathways to go for a stroll and lovely soft grass to have some fun on. 

We stayed in the Gold/White room. Restored and decorated beautifully - very large, with a large TV AND King size bed to match.
The bed and sheets were extremely comfortable.

Marijan and Peter were the perfect hosts - ensuring we had everything we needed. 
They supplied the little things that normal places don't such as toothbrushes and toothpaste - and as well as adequate toiletries.

One highlight to our stay was they provided us with fresh fruits from their garden and Marijan's delicious plum jam! (As well as other items to eat/drink)
Its these little things that make going somewhere enjoyable and it really did help aid in our relaxation.

Thanks again Marijan and Peter for making our 10 Year Anniversary memorable!"
22636387,487316749,2019-07-14,45124734,Tamara,"There is no denying that this is a stunning property. The gold room was gorgeous, well appointed and everything you would expect from a manor house. The second room unfortunately paled in comparison, with a literally a tv  the size of a laptop screen and electric blanket that was a single size and only warmed one side of the bed (I was freezing and Mum was like a hot water bottle ha ha). 

The main living space lacked ANY form of heating and we found ourselves utterly  freezing  in literally sub zero  temperatures. We were forced to eat and huddling around a heater in the main bedroom...not what you would expect from a property that charged over $1,200 for a weekend (I mean who wants to eat dinner in a semi circle around a heater  in a bedroom????)

Breakfast was scarce and there was a distinct sense of a lack of generosity about the place. As a long time Airbnb user, I’m used to small thoughtful touches   rather than 3 tiny packets of cereal for breakfast for a group. I’ve stayed in properties for $120 a night and they were so consumer focused, as well as places $2k a night which were sensational (thorngrove manor for example) 

The property is grand and stunning, but it’s not decked out for winter unless you intend to wear snow gear.... to BED...I’m not even kidding! ( the pool is covered so you won’t get the photos you see on the air bnb page etc). In spring/summer months I’m sure it would be magical. We informed our hosts we decided to find alternative accomodation for the second night we paid for due to the sheer freezing temperatures in the home-it was utterly inhabitable. We weren’t offered a refund, rather we were told if we wanted to visit again they would heat the home. I think they need a lesson in customer service. As a business owner I would never treat my consumers that way-that’s not how you treat someone spending that amount of money. 

There is no wifi codes provided so expect to not able to contact the outside world during your stay. I couldn’t receive  texts, check my work emails and there was nothing in the info books around how to access it. 

I think this place could be magical, it just needs a passionate manager who understands customer service, who is generous and genuinely wants their customers to enjoy the experience. 

It’s hard to determine whether or not to recommend. The building is lovely, it’s just not particularly comfortable. I think there are other manor houses who really understand the customer, are passionate, generous and decent, I don’t think this place is it. It’s not about the asthmatics alone. To be fair, it’s about how you utilise the property and how it makes you feel. My rating? 2/5 they need to lift their game and not focus entirely on profit. I’d rather pay an extra $200 a stay for those little touches to include those who care about the customer experience. I hope this is a realistic wake up call  to these guys. It’s a competitive (Website hidden by Airbnb) better!!! People will return because of the experience you created, not because your MO  is income generation. We should have been provided a refund for a second night after raising our issues you directly. . That would have been the right thing...but these people don’t do the right thing, they put them and thier bottom line first....and do we really want to support businesses like that? I think not, choose elsewhere until they learn the art of decency and hospitality."
22636387,506613429,2019-08-11,19208849,Vivien,"We spent a very special weekend at this property and enjoyed the luxurious gold room in the manor, which is very private with a separate entrance. The furnishings in the room are in Georgian style with quality throughout. Also the bed is very comfortable with a high quality mattress. The old blends with the new as there is a flat screen TV, wi-fi access and heating. We also enjoyed the electric blanket which was working perfectly. The property has a beautiful large swimming pool set amongst majestic trees and pretty gardens with pathways. We enjoyed a tour of the property with a vineyard, sheep, llamas and chickens. Breakfast is provided in a modern kitchenette off the lounge area and is self service. There are tea and coffee making facilities and a fridge for personal use.

We enjoyed touring the wineries and eating in the Barossa as there is so much to see in the nearby vicinity. Our experience was very positive with such warm and friendly hosts. We would certainly recommend this accommodation."
22636387,530560963,2019-09-16,267653725,Brynn,Absolutely stunning views and a great location for our trip!!
22636387,585625604,2020-01-01,95190913,Kelley,"My husband and I had the most amazing stay with our little daughter. It was definately a trip to remember ! 

We enjoyed walking around the property, playing in the pool, cooking dinner on the bbq and relaxing in the amazing house. 

We used the lawn games and had so much fun family time together. 

The best parts were the privacy on the property and views ! 

We also were gifted with a bottle of wine from the owners vineyard on new years eve. 

Highly recommend  !"
22636387,588672957,2020-01-04,49752081,Georgia,"We had an amazing time at Martinsell Manor, the house and surrounding gardens are stunning. The rooms are so grand and luxurious, Peter and Marijan have done a wonderful job renovating. They were excellent hosts, offering so much knowledge on the property and area. We had such a relaxing trip, highly recommend!!"
22636387,720660313,2021-01-02,99464633,Holly,"We had a lovely few days here over New Year's Eve (spending quite a lot of the time in the swimming pool)! The area is beautiful, with nice walks nearby and further afield; the building is very lovely; there's clearly a lot of good wineries and restaurants within a 20 minute drive or so, though we mostly didn't venture far away as there were so many spaces outdoors in particular to sit around and read or look at the wonderful views over fields."
22636387,722263497,2021-01-05,140824718,Areebah,"Lovely accomodation surrounded by beautifully kept gardens. Highlights were the pool, great amount of amenities (breakfast, snacks, cooking essentials and toiletries) and antique style interiors. Thank you for all your help and effort you put into making the space beautiful!"
22794701,275418425,2018-06-11,187045775,Alicia,Loved staying at this cottage! Everything was so comfortable and clean. It is obvious that Deb has put a lot of time and thought into making sure that the place is “just right”. From the supplies in the kitchen to the way each room was set up - you really felt like a valued house guest. We started each morning with a walk through the videyards and enjoyed spotting kangaroos and other local wildlife - stunning! Steve was great too and nothing was too much trouble. Definitely make sure you visit their cellar door if you are there on a weekend - the wine and cheese platter were fantastic.
22794701,477196813,2019-06-27,173766543,Liz,Such a beautiful home within an amazing setting. Every little detail exceptional x
22794701,639694644,2020-07-19,353345262,Wade,Would highly recommend Linfield Cottage. Everything a much needed getaway required and much more.
22794701,723142104,2021-01-09,381150940,Trevor,"Lovely well appointed place, Helpful and friendly host would certainly recommend the place and host to anyone."
22855141,244032146,2018-03-18,158637810,Kirsty,"Our family of four stayed at Sally’s place for 6 nights and had a really fantastic time there. Staying at a working vineyard, especially during harvest time, was a fascinating experience. Sally and Martin were wonderful hosts, they made us feel very welcome. We were able to walk around the vineyard, watch the harvest, feed the rescued kangaroos (and the geese and peacock), we borrowed bikes from them, enjoyed a complimentary bottle of wine from the vineyard, were given lots of tips on what to do in the area and very much enjoyed Sally’s homemade cookies and crisps and the chickens freshly laid eggs. 

The house overlooks rolling hills of the vineyard and has a lovely view framed by the garden and lots of native trees; we loved just sitting out on the deck and taking in the scenery and listening to the birds. The house has lots of character with artwork and thoughtful touches including fresh flowers. It was spotlessly clean; we had lots of space; the kitchen was suitably equipped for the several meals that we cooked there, the condiments were appreciated, plus the fridge was stocked with milk, butter and some local goodies on our arrival. Overall we really enjoyed our time there and would love to come back for another stay if we make it back to Australia some day. Thanks Sally and Martin for a wonderful time."
22855141,251390048,2018-04-08,174139890,Paul,"Whistler Vineyard Retreat is an absolutely fantastic accommodation in the heart of the Barossa Valley. We spent two days with Sally and Martin and cannot recommend their accommodation highly enough! 
From the minute Sally and Martin welcomed us to their retreat, the kind gesture  of a complimentary bottle of whistler wine and platter waiting for us on arrival and the perfect location to enjoy a glass of wine on the back verandah and watch the sun set over the vineyards we knew this was special and felt right at home. We loved every moment we spent at Whistler's Retreat, and hope to return again soon. Thank you Sally and Martin, just perfect."
22855141,260772870,2018-05-05,51856360,David,"We really enjoyed our stay with Sally and Martin.  The setting is beautiful facing out to vineyards, in a quiet winegrowing area that makes for a serene stay with quiet, dark evenings that highlight all the stars you haven’t seen since you were a child.  Their friendly menagerie wandered about the property; their gorgeous peacock would periodically check in on us, and their friendly dogs and cat would occasionally come by to greet us as well.  Of course there are geese, the orphaned kangaroos they care for near their cellar door, and the chickens that provide your breakfast eggs as well.   We appreciated the fresh flowers, snacks, breakfast goodies, local recommendations, and their sincere and friendly hospitality.  And when we reported a minor problem one evening, Sally and Martin immediately fixed it.    Internet worked perfectly well even while accessing some data-heavy spreadsheets for work.  Over a decade ago we stayed at another nearby property where we had sole use of a guesthouse, and we really preferred our stay here, as we had all the privacy we wanted while having access to the recommendations and company of 30+ year locals when desired.  Don’t wait,....book this guestwing now!"
22855141,269100410,2018-05-27,156099057,Ashish,"The experience was nothing short of extraordinary. A perfect getaway in the middle of the beautiful Barossa Valley. Starting with an amazing, very warm host [Sally] to the most scenic/beautiful property with deeply thought out amenities and, what deserves the most mention, a collection of adorable pets [incl baby kangaroos and peacocks!]. A true gem! "
22855141,290655608,2018-07-15,885624,Daisy,"Very nice place, stylish, sparkling clean and quite .. highly recommended ! Thank you very much for your very much welcomed hosting!"

22855141,308166995,2018-08-16,56788834,Patsy,"One word: Superb. From the welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine, recommendations on local spots to visit, to just sitting and gazing at the wind playing in the trees; this was  heaven!  Gorgeous accommodation with thoughtful and interesting touches.  We had three days and could easily have enjoyed more.  A fabulous property. "
22855141,309857947,2018-08-19,64007556,Meghan,"The Whistler is one of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed in! We spent the evening by a roaring fire and Sally's incredibly well stocked kitchen, complementary bottle of wine produced on site and heated floors kept us extremely warm and happy. The location couldn't have been better for wine tasting and in summer, taking a bike ride around the vineyards (bikes offered on site), would be lovely. Sally's hospitality could not be topped and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to explore the Barossa."
22855141,313691704,2018-08-26,46049706,Louise,"Very clean and cared for rooms and property in a private vineyard setting.
Sally was an excellent host that provided us with everything we could possibly need including a bottle of their own lable of premium Shiraz on arrival together with a local cheese board.
We particularly enjoyed sitting around the fire in their garden at night sharing stories and a glass or two of wine.

"
22855141,331170117,2018-10-02,213086351,Nicola,Fantastic place to stay. Bottle of wine and platter on arrival. Cosy guest house in a stunning location.  Sally was an amazing host providing lots of lovely touches including the best homemade anzac cookies I’ve ever had.
22855141,338548326,2018-10-19,47058579,Pia,"From the very first message to Sally I knew I had picked a great place to stay! On our arrival she was so welcoming and offered us so much great advice about where to go and what to see, not to mention the lovely welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine. It was also all the other touches, home made cookies, crackers and fresh eggs from the chooks in the back garden. We enjoyed a glass of wine on the back balcony overlooking the vineyard as the sun set, magical!! The accommodation is spotlessly clean and the beds are super comfy! Location is perfect and we were central to so many amazing vineyards and restaurants as well as the new Gin Distillery just up the road. We also enjoyed a wine tasting at the Whistler cellar door, beautiful setting on the lawns. All in all this place is the only place anyone should stay at when visiting the Barossa. Sally makes you feel so welcome as soon as you meet her and is happy to share her knowledge and love for the Barossa. We will definitely come back and have already recommended it to our friends."
22855141,352148897,2018-11-24,51261670,Jane,"Sally was a wonderful host. The personal touches (like home baked cookies, farm fresh eggs,  fruit) make you feel at home from the first moment. The home is located in the vineyard and is very serene, with the resident farm animals wandering about creating a very relaxed and familiar atmosphere. I highly recommend Sally’s place!"
22855141,356645410,2018-12-09,8296391,Anthony,"Amazing location to venture across the Barossa Valley. The host knows the area well and recommendations been great! This range from where to eat, drink, grocery etc . And she always response fast.

The stay been great with a nice kitchen to wipe up meals after Barossa Farmers Market, and having it on the patio, facing the sunset over the vineyard. Mornings are a delight to have the resident peacock going by, chickens giving freshly laid eggs and geese going by. 

The wines from Whistler packs surprises. Do spend time at their cellar doors, while children could while their time at the playground.

Lovely host and place."
22855141,405893638,2019-01-27,232483896,Outsa,"It was absolutly amazing. I can't say enough about how beautiful the place was. Sally was such a lovely host and had everything we could have needed ready for us. If you love piece and quiet, animals, pizza and wine then this is the place for you."

Sally was a welcoming host , from the plate of local produce on arrival , home baked snacks and fresh eggs to providing great information about the area . Sally provides the right balance between attentiveness and being unobtrusive.  We had a fabulous weekend hanging out at the vineyard as well as getting out and about . Highly recommended!"
22855141,443362203,2019-04-25,33465985,Aisha And Lea,This was a beautiful little place to stay. Really loved watching the geese walking about the lawns and spying Roger the resident peacock.  Not only were the hosts very accommodating but we were welcomed with a lovely bottle of white wine and a cheese platter. Just a beautiful way to start a mini holiday in the Barossa. I would definitely recommend this lovely piece of paradise to anyone.
22855141,445237080,2019-04-29,178754917,Marcia,"This was a peaceful relaxing place to stay. The setting was really beautiful. The apartment was stylish and well appointed. The wine, the platter and the eggs on arrival were really nice and very tasty. There were so many little extras such as condiments, home baked biscuits and books on the book shelf. We highly recommend this as a really lovely place to escape the city hustle and bustle. It was a good central location for sampling what the delights of the Barossa. Thank you for having us. :-)"

22855141,540690443,2019-10-04,155080644,Clay,"This place is in a beautiful location at a fantastic winery. Great walks around the vineyard, dams and animal enclosure were a great start and end to our day. The hosts are super helpful and very responsive to any requests.
The cottage is very well equipped with everything you could need and the hammock was an especially nice touch.
Thanks for the use of the push bikes and the local tips and advice. Can’t wait to come back."
22855141,546730072,2019-10-14,11647836,Craig,"Amazing! I could stay here for a full week!
There is so many things to do at Whistler from a walk around the vineyard to play equipment (for kids), roo enclosure and of course the great wine!
Wonderful hospitality, local suggestions and relaxing surrounds."
22855141,560819550,2019-11-07,97892030,Susan,"Sally's place is impeccable.  It is beautifully presented, charming with many personal touches.  Surrounded by a gorgeous garden and sited in a vineyard it is the perfect place to stay in the Barossa.  Sally herself is friendly and hospitable and has thought of everything to make your stay comfortable and to provide expert information about the area."
22855141,564930277,2019-11-16,46307010,Tamie,"Amazing hospitality, delicious fresh eggs for breakfast, home made biscuits, platter & wine on arrival and a gorgous, sparkling clean place with all you could need. There was even a luxurious deep bath. Sally gave us loads of local tips and was always available when needed. The winery has delicious wines and a green open space for relaxing while tasting and plenty for the kids to do too.  Everyone we met there was friendly and helpful, we were also lucky enough to be there for one of their friday night food truck and wine nights.
The view from the place is of the vines and it is very easy to get to many wineries inc Seppeltsfield and Maggie Beers restaurant. I highly recommend staying here, it is a treat! Thank you Sally for ensuring our weekend was so memorable."
22855141,628409757,2020-06-08,186022405,Helen,"The perfect quiet getaway in the country. If you are after a private bonfire, with short walks, in a beautiful  location this is the place. Sally was generous in her supply of little extras. The underground floor heating during cold winter nights was fantastic."
22855141,630907351,2020-06-21,78197864,Tiana,"We had a lovely stay during a rainy weekend. Cozy, warm and everything you need! Sally was lovely, we will be back for longer next time!"
22855141,634672449,2020-07-05,4368356,Jessica,"Absolutely loved staying here. Sally and Martin are excellent hosts and their property is stunning. This is a stylish and private space with all you need for a relaxing stay in the Barossa. Beautiful location overlooking the vines, awesome bath, great walking and cycling track and close to Tanunda."
22855141,636639664,2020-07-11,229890919,Michael,"We absolutely loved our stay at Whistler Wines, and are sure you will too, whether you are traveling with kids or without. Sally was extremely proactive with communications, and we couldn't have received a warmer welcome at checkin from Ellen. The location, just off Seppeltsfield Road, is arguably one of the best positions in the Barossa - you're just a stone's throw from Torbreck, Two Hands wines and Seppeltsfield, and a short drive from Nuriootpa and Angaston. The retreat was a warm, welcoming space, comfortably furnished and with amazing amenities (+1 for underfloor heating and a deep soaking bath overlooking the vineyards!). Our children especially loved meeting the friendly dog, Winnie, the geese and the rescue kangaroos down by the cellar door. Fresh eggs are provided from the well-fed hens on site and there are other amenities like freshly baked biscuits, great coffee and even Sal's home made tomato sauce. As our stay was mid-winter, we didn't have much of an opportunity to enjoy the outdoor area (including hammock!), but this would be divine once spring rolls around. Highly recommended!"
22855141,640346746,2020-07-20,323500698,Chris,"Fabulous welcome, accommodation and location. We loved walking with the dogs. A perfect break with the cellar door to walk to with fantastic wines to try. Sally is very generous leaving us a lovely bottle of wine to welcome us, a cheese platter, homemade crackers, I’d love the recipe please, and biscuits. Could not have asked for more and we’ll be back."
22855141,648510468,2020-08-09,15123164,Brian,"A perfect place for a long weekend, even in winter! A warm welcome from Ellen on one of coldest days. Lovely food provision - cheese platter, eggs, biscuits, fruit, coffee, tea, milk, butter and a bottle of Whistler wine. 

It’s a great location for many other wineries, and just two minute drive to Appellation for dinner. 

The kitchen is well equipped, we cooked a dinner with local produce from the farmers market.

The bedding is comfortable, soft and fluffy towels, and nice bath tub overlooking the wineyard. 

The underfloor heating is just perfect for winter, a mild and effective heating. It was a little wet to have an outdoor fire that weekend but it would be perfect setting on other cold days.

Absolutely love the geese! They are just gorgeous little things. (Not that little actually)

Highly recommended and we’d love to return on other occasions."
22855141,658087935,2020-08-30,357518801,Emily,"A truly fabulous place to stay!! Great location, atmosphere, full of comforts and personality. We’ll definitely be back again soon. Thank you!"
22855141,665928751,2020-09-20,49898601,Bodhi,"This is a beautiful piece of paradise in the heart of the Barossa. Sally was a kind and thoughtful host and made sure we were comfortable during our stay. Her extra sweet touches, like fresh flower bouquets, rice packs to warm the bed, fresh eggs from the chickens and a delicious welcome platter and a bottle of delicious Whistler Wines are just a few of the fine touches. The beautiful scenery amongst the vines and all the animals made this a truly unique experience that I would recommend for anyone. I know we will be back."
22855141,669272529,2020-09-29,152159109,Brooke,"A beautiful little spot with lovely hosts, great wine and close to all the best spots in the Barossa! Highly recommended. Thanks  Sally and Martin"
22855141,671416076,2020-10-05,168081030,Gen,"A beautiful peaceful stay. Sally was very hospitable, the wine and platter were very thoughtful. A perfect place to relax."
22855141,703446347,2020-10-25,335167056,Martyn,"We had a great stay here with our adult son and his partner. The house was very comfortable (the underfloor heating was a bonus as the weather became very cold) and the beds were also comfy. Sally provided little welcoming extras such as heatbags for the beds, homemade soaps, homemade biscuits, fresh eggs, a cheese platter and bottle of wine. There were also some basic but very useful provisions left in the cupboards (salt, pepper, oil, gladwrap, etc) which were great to have as we cooked a couple of meals. The view over the vines was very peaceful and the chooks, geese and roos provided some entertainment! The central location made accessing wineries and restaurants in the Barossa easy. Would definitely stay here again!"
22855141,707269865,2020-11-07,264196428,Matthew,"Such a great space and location. Guests are only metres from the vineyard with ample places outside to socialise and soak it all in. The attention to detail was outstanding with a welcome platter, homemade Anzac bikkies (yum), fresh eggs and cut flowers. Sally and Martin were fantastic hosts, and we’re looking forward to returning sometime in the future."
22855141,736905414,2021-03-07,130067590,Gary,"All round 5 Star stay we had. The BnB was stunning and super easy to get around to all of Tanunda’s best offerings.

Lovely personal touches like homemade biscuits and a welcome bottle of wine were wonderful, and topped off with a late check out. An all round lovely stay !"
22869313,246173997,2018-03-25,3267039,Shireen,Very clean and comfortable cottage in a quiet village. The provisions were excellent and the linens and bedrooms very comfortable. The owner is very helpful and accommodating. There is no garden so if you have kids this is something to bear in mind. The restaurants and cellar doors are around 15 minutes drive (some may be closer).
22869313,323624171,2018-09-16,29606552,Scott,Every fine detail is catered for and all add up to 5 star quality accommodation. Such a beautiful and romantic little get away spot!

22869313,449560671,2019-05-07,5481192,Renée,"This place raises the Air BnB standard. Staying here is a must for a Barossa Valley visit. Mel has thought of everything, including freshly picked roses, bath salts for the bath, amazing food and drink supply, candles, stocked firewood. I had no trouble communicating with Mel and she is extremely accommodating."
22869313,451003144,2019-05-10,33018208,David,Beautifully appointed cottage in the middle of town. The breakfast and food and wine supplied was from local producers and excellent quality. Everything you could need a great place to stay
22869313,452772993,2019-05-14,21901214,Sasha,This place is beyond expectations. Every single touch had been carefully thought about and many surprises. We loved our stay and couldn’t recommend it more. Thankyou Mel for allowing us to stay. We will remember it forever
22869313,470102022,2019-06-16,216596579,Mikki,"This is such a charming cottage in the Barossa Valley area.  Every vineyard is a short drive away.  Mel the owner has Queen's Cottage decorated in such a lovely way from sheets, towels and even the bed covers are 5 star.  The cottage is filled with supplies from chocolates, wine, breakast provisions, and many more.  The fire is warm and cozy with heaps of candles and wood is supplied for your stay.  Mel even supplies bath salt for the lovely claw tub.  Thank you Mel for the lovely birthday celebration I was able to give to my husband on our weekend trip to the lovely Barossa."
22869313,495968721,2019-07-27,31482441,Alex,Could not recommend Queen’s cottage more highly. Mel goes above and beyond to make the stay as memorable as possible. 10/10.
22869313,535640906,2019-09-25,191817010,Holly,"Beautiful house, so well renovated and beautifully appointed with everything you need for a special trip. Lots of great little touches and extras. Have already been recommending to everyone!"

22869313,626892558,2020-05-31,90955127,Debra,"Like the other 5-star reviews, we were absolutely delighted with ALL that we found at Mel's Queens Cottage. The space is thoughtfully decorated and is warm and welcoming. There were gourmet delights for us from local businesses. Breakfast provisions were very welcomed and generous. The beds are firm and comfortable, with electric blankets (which was very appreciated during our stay as the nights were cold!). Having said that, the wood fire certainly warmed the living area beautifully and added a lovely ambience. The under floor heating in the laundry and bathroom was a welcome treat for bare feet and kept that end of the house gently warm. If you can't be bothered lighting the fire, there were 2 reverse cycle air conditioners that quickly warmed the living area, bedrooms and kitchen.
Despite being on the main road, we barely heard any traffic and being a country town, there really wasn't any traffic to be seen anyway.
We really enjoyed our stay in the Barossa and will be back to enjoy this fabulous find again."
22869313,628097352,2020-06-07,133996334,Brooke,"My stay at Mel’s was amazing. The home itself was lovely, but it was the little touches that really made my time there really nice. 

There were fresh muffins waiting for us, as well as some lovely chocolates and port by the fireplace (which was already made up and ready for us to light!)

Mel provided a gorgeous spread for breakfast - fresh eggs, bacon, tomato, mushrooms, yogurt, fresh fruit, croissants, as well as some cereals. There was milk and orange juice as well and lots of tea and coffee options. 

The house was in the perfect spot to walk to the local pubs for dinner, not even a two minute walk. 

My weekend at Mel’s was amazing, so relaxing, I didn’t need to worry about anything. Highly recommend!!"
22869313,629370075,2020-06-13,94264560,Justine,Excellent with a lovely warm fireplace and lovely large hot shower for a winter retreat

The place was beautiful, and there were so many lovely little touches that just made it perfect (like the freshly baked cookies and breakfast). The underfloor heating in the bathroom was incredible and the fire was so cosy. Mel have really helpful tips on getting there and into the accommodation, and had super quick communication. I hope to be able to go again soon!"
22869313,637053039,2020-07-12,351298424,Grace,"Your expectations will be exceeded above and beyond. My friends and I had an amazing 2 night stay at Queens Cottage and we were blown away. 

The place was clean and tidy and Mel thought of literally everything. From the provision on cheese and wine, right down to the paper bags that were available when we were looking for extra bags upon leaving. 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the Barossa."
22869313,645439740,2020-08-02,66706658,Rhiannon,"Loved every second here! Such an inviting, clean and warm home. Hospitality is one of the best I’ve seen and received so far. 
So close to some beautiful hikes, we were spoilt for choice. 
I can’t fault this place or Mel’s attention to detail at all. Thanks!"
22869313,654012598,2020-08-21,99692079,Russel,Absolutely beautiful. All the little added touches made our stay extra special. Perfect for a little getaway and so close to everything.
22869313,663469336,2020-09-13,35040291,Steph,"Beautiful cottage, lovely cheese & wine provisions. Loved the fresh loaf of bread and breakfast aswell. Central location in Williamstown"
22869313,701337482,2020-10-18,119195140,Hector,"If you could have someone think of your every holiday need or better still the things you did not know you knew, how amazing would that be?
Thanks Mel, that was how we felt staying at your cottage in the Barossa.
The cottage is so quaint and immaculately kept.
Arriving to a fridge of beautiful local produce, wine and chocolate is such a treat. Great size bedrooms with starched linen, like all 5 star hotels.  Living room with a real fireplace and comfy sofa and chairs and cottage decor. Great big bathroom and extra loo works well if you are a group of 4.
The detail is where Mel’s cottage sets itself apart from other properties.
I didn’t even think of a picnic until we stumbled upon a picnic blanket and picnic hamper. A picnic at Angaston Lookout was awesome! Plush Robes, history of the area, games, centrally located in Williamstown. 
So many positives, the only negative is that we had to leave!
Thank you so much Mel for such a wonderful stay! Highly recommend Queens Cottage!"
22869313,722456747,2021-01-06,344412150,Shoshana,"Beautiful home! Lots of special touches (like candles, room sprays, beautiful outside furniture) and the bath is amazing!"

There were 5 of us (adults) and we had ample space, with two bathrooms and two lounges. Just off the main street and a short walk from Peter Lehman and Langmeil. Would definitely recommend for big groups or families and hope to visit again!"

Very well set up kitchen with masses of cutlery, plates etc. Washing machine, easy access to line. Added extras include wine fridge and pool table. Two wineries within walking distance and easy access to town  and the rest of the Borossa. Fills a much needed gap in the market as a lot of Barossa accommodation caters only to couples."

24173232,412552972,2019-02-15,3568917,Shane,Heath’s property is a great place to stay while in the barossa especially if you have a larger group.

The location is perfect, the house is very spacious with plenty of bedrooms, separate spaces for relaxing, watching tv, dining and even a pool table area which was great fun. There is also an outdoor area with large table and chairs and bbq. The kitchen is also large with everything you could need and more.

The breakfast provisions were plentiful and delicious, the outlook upon waking in the morning spectacular and the house itself was carefully looked after! For two families it was the perfect choice as it provided space, a beautiful wood fire in Winter and lots of outdoor space to roam too! Everything was comfortable and well presented. The location was perfect as it was just a short trip to many of the wineries and towns. We will definitely be back but for a little longer next time!"

Their place was extremely clean and the beds felt like I was sleeping in a 5 star hotel. Sheets were super clean and bath towels were also. The location is also very central to all the wineries. I would definitely come back here to stay for our next visit. Thank you so much for having us !"

It provided ample room for a family group with lots of catching up to do. The property is everything as described, kitchen and rooms are stocked with everything required for a big cook-up and the booking process was smooth.
Lisa was excellent to introduce us to the property, provided great support and assistance during our stay. As well, the get started provisions were fresh and more than ample. Thank-you and we recommend this property to anyone."

It was freezing during our weekend in the Barossa but we were warm and toasty by the fire. We definitely made us of the electric blankets and reverse cycle heaters also. The beds are really comfortable and the shower was excellent! Lisa and Matt made sure that our breakfast provisions were vegan and made us feel very welcome. I'd love to come back in the Summer to pick fruit from the many fruit trees! We also loved the seclusion of the property but so close to Tanunda.
24314297,671398760,2020-10-05,42665809,Darren,"A perfect venue for a romantic getaway or for a family group.

And the communication and assistance with booking wine tours whilst in Tanunda was exceptional. Highly recommend the Highlights tour, we had a fantastic time. 
The house was beautiful and clean, with just about everything we needed to create a home away from home. Shops, cafes and restaurants only minutes walk but the kitchen was also very well equipped to enable us to enjoy meals at home also.

25086405,284665502,2018-07-02,192215949,Sally,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the Barossa and both Tuoi and her beautiful property were exceptionally welcoming.  Villa Maria was spotlessly clean and very comfortable.  An extra highlight to our weekend was an evening meal at FermentAsian that was superb.   
25086405,309896403,2018-08-19,42655046,Craig,Toui's house is beautifully renovated with all the modern features. The rooms are lovely and each has it's own ensuite. The kitchen is great and gets the morning sun. It is a short walk to shops and restaurants and location is great to visit lots of the wineries. We loved our stay there and would definitely come back.
25086405,330718142,2018-10-01,147827623,Kate,Thank you SO much Tuoi.  We absolutely LOVED your home and the stay was 10 out of 10 (or more!).  We highly recommend your place to anyone.

25893345,582980923,2019-12-28,182723544,Saumya,Its a great place one must go to. Very spacious and the structure/house it self is a wonderful place. The kids loved it.
25893345,723573069,2021-01-10,193376279,David,"Nine mates and I stayed in the house in the house which is a grand old place and had a nice weekend but thought we had the house to ourselves. We were disappointed we weren’t made aware the house is sold off in sections like hotel rooms  with tiny kitchens and fridges in bedrooms and that we were sharing the house with other guests with only a locked door between us so at night had to be quiet and respectful to the other people  staying there which wasn’t easy with 10 of us. There are units at the back of the house also and all had access to the pool which at times made it difficult for all of us to go for a swim as there was a limit of 10 people in the pool area at one time. 
As we were taking away a friend who is terminal and we wanted to give him a great weekend with a lot of drinking and laughs but we were restricted in what we could do.
Kym as a host was polite and responded to all correspondence in a speedy manner.
David"
25893345,736886713,2021-03-07,122621187,Charis,"Correspondence with this host that became an extremely horrible experience with her and Airbnb. I will not be booking again through Airbnb so I’m not concerned with a potential nasty review from this host. I do not typically leave reviews unless I have something positive to say, but here it is....

There have been a few issues since we arrived and it is rather disappointing given the price we are paying and how this property has been advertised.

- Booking suggests that we have booked the entire house, not that there are  multiple shared facilities with the apartments that are located on the same property directly behind the house.

- rowdy guests from apartments making inappropriate comments when we arrived. Then hogging the pool area being really loud, rowdy and putting us off going to the pool as their behaviour is quite disruptive and a bit intimidating.

- Random people from the apartments coming over onto the verandah and putting their empty bottles into the bins while we are sitting / chatting - no privacy or peace and quiet.

- Naked / screaming children were running through the back of the house / verandah area - no privacy or peace and quiet.

- apartment guests having a family reunion/ party for someone’s 30th -  no privacy or peace and quiet and as there is a “no party policy” this is not in keeping with that policy.

- Secure the dishwasher - it tips over when you are loading the dishes and the drawers tip out onto the floor injuring someone’s foot. This complaint was also on a 2018 TripAdvisor review but still continues.

- our booking says ‘entire house’ and we will have the entire home to ourselves. Yet another person showed up after the first 24 hours to stay in “the Ruby Suite”. This is not accurately represented in our booking.

- host said she would get back to us, but didn’t- this meant we were outside the Airbnb 24 hour window for resolution/ refund. 

- host refused a refund and despite multiple other reviews on TripAdvisor and Airbnb voicing similar issues (only found these after our issues as they are hidden amongst glowing reviews for the apartments) there remains a complete lack of transparency in there advertising.

- This host is exploiting every possible Airbnb loophole and getting away with it in a recurring manner."
25915403,487236086,2019-07-14,92934565,Scott,A nice place to stay!
25915403,493071941,2019-07-22,18630617,Sandy,"Crystal’s home was absolutely lovely! The house was clean, tidy, cosy and inviting. It was close to everything we needed and wanted to see in the Barossa.

Crystal went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable. The fridge was stocked with ingredients to make breakfast, and Crystal even dropped off a coffee machine to us the day we arrived, after it was replaced. The fire was set up ready to light as soon as we arrived.

My correspondence with Crystal before and during our stay was always friendly, polite & prompt."

25915403,507726582,2019-08-12,88208940,James,Very neat property only moments into the Main Street.

25915403,523977107,2019-09-05,90506349,Pamela,"Crystal’s place was very clean, well set out and equipped. Very comfortable for two couples.

Great for the kids and had everything we needed. Outdoor area and deck was great and location is close driving distance to all the Barossa attractions.

25915403,630476146,2020-06-19,118464204,Stacey,"House was lovely and clean with nice touches, we really enjoyed the coffee pod machine, deep bath & wood fire heater was used both days and creates a beautiful ambience and all the warmth you need on the cold winters night..we really enjoyed sitting in front after we put our son to bed with a bottle of sparkling wine.

Banana bread was one of the best we’ve had and we really enjoyed! Bottle of OJ, cereal and a bottle of wine were lovely!

Master bedroom was spacious and easy enough to have the porta cot in room without tripping over.

Was extra special to be able to bring our dogs as one has to take medication twice a day so it’s hard to getway unless they are invited.

Fantastic location with a 15 minute walk to Lyndoch town, the town has a bakery and the vegetarian pasty was amazing!!! Also in town is the local pub with a bottle-o attached all staff lovely. The Lord Lyndoch for something a special was an enjoyable dinner with great staff.
God Hill winery is 16 minute walk and the view is one of the best I’ve seen a photo doesn’t do it justice..Charlie the wine maker and owner is so lovely and passionate he also made us the best Italian platter and Sharon was beyond lovely and gave us such a experience with our one on one tasting..our one year old son absolutely loved her! Lots of fantastic (Website hidden by Airbnb) a must but ring before to book.
Kies winery is a 26 min walk and you could spend the whole day there with a great grass area with activities and a gorgeous husky who is super friendly... wines are delicious. We then walked to Chateau Yaldara..there is no path for for about 19 minutes so walking is fine but with a pusher is a little more adventurous but definitely do it if your up for it, the landscape is gorgeous and plenty of photo opportunities. Chateau Yaldara is one of our favourites! Plenty of reasons location is breathtaking, great food and if you have kids a fantastic play area, and the wines are always good!


Overall we had a great experience and would definitely stay again, thanks for having us we made lots of great memories."

25916821,338938431,2018-10-21,88050061,Martin,Such a lovely home. So appropriately presented.
25916821,506735783,2019-08-11,13080330,Michel,"This is hands down, the best AirBnB my partner and I ever stayed at.  It was clean, cosy, with loads of personality.  The fireplace is nice and central, and great to curl up near it with a book or playing games.  The kitchen has everything you'd ever need, and the spa in the bathroom is a treat to relax in.

The host has thought of everything.  I know it's a bit more expensive but it's worth every cent.  We will definitely be coming here again if we are to stay in the Barossa in the future."
25916821,718984681,2020-12-27,48427227,Gregory,"What a charming, beautiful cottage full of history and character. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and don’t hesitate to recommend to others. We appreciated all the generous and thoughtful touches. The rooms were spacious and beds comfortable. The kitchen was stocked up with everything you might possibly need. We enjoyed the walk to Angaston to pick up some homemade ice cream and there was a fabulous playground for the kids. For the adults, the cottage is close to wineries such as Yalumba and other attractions such as Maggie Beer. We also enjoyed sitting out in the backyard playing cards and soaking up the Barossa Valley atmosphere."
25916821,719546398,2020-12-29,130804357,Rebecca,This was a charming and cute place to stay at. The bedrooms were a good decent size. Everything was clean and tidy.

25928338,290152164,2018-07-14,92069202,Desiree,"When you talk about location this little pice of luxury is spot on.  The newly refurbished 3 bedroom house was the perfect break from reality that we were after.  The couch was comfy the heating was perfect the beds were amazing and so was the TVs and Netflix.

The kitchen was a pleasure to cook in and I can only imagine sitting on the deck (in warmer weather) with a glass of local wine and platter of produce  (which Sarah will happily organize for you) would be heaven.

Perfect for a couple, group of friends or a family as the property was totally enclosed and there was area for the children to play.  I would like to return with a group of girls so that we could indulge in a weekend of fine food, wine and fun.

Thanks for having us we had a very relaxing time.

The house is super clean and the kitchen is fully stocked with all appliances and Utensils- we collected food from our day and then cooked dinner at night it was great! My daughter also left her favourite puppy at the house and Sarah found it and is sending it back to us! We are going to have one happy child!

Location is perfect, across the road from Foodland, short walk to wine bars, delicious food and gorgeous shops. The house has everything you need and more. Looks recently renovated and is super clean and homey. Beautifully decorated. We were two couples and were extremely comfortable in the space.
Even enjoyed wine in front of a working fireplace!"

The perfect getaway for 3 couples who want to enjoy a weekend wine by the fireplace surrounded by all that the Barossa has to offer. All the little touches were so well thought out! All of the amenities were amazing. Couldn’t have asked for a better stay.
25928338,487323339,2019-07-14,45197600,Gloria,"A sanctuary in so many ways... When looking for a place to celebrate my husband's 50th with a small group of friends it was very hard to find somewhere that catered for 3 couples, but that wasn't so big and expensive it wouldn't feel welcoming, especially in winter. Then I found the Sanctuary and I have to say it was a pleasant surprise. The home is large enough to give 3 couples privacy but set up with enough seating and amenities to make it feel cosy, inviting and engaging. I would recommend it to a small group of friends who want to escape somewhere the same as if not nicer than home that is opulent, super comfortable and has the beautiful Barossa Valley at your doorstep. One of the best restaurants in the world (in my opinion) Ferment Asian is just a short stroll away which means you can treat yourselves to a special night out and not have to worry about driving or taxis. The outdoor deck would be great on a warm evening to sit and debate who bought the best wine whilst the BBQ cooks or a soak in the hot tub after a long day out exploring is equally as inviting and indulgent. There are lots of interesting books to read if you feel like you want to wind down and take yourself somewhere else whilst sitting in the comfy snuggle seat or take a long soak in the beautiful freestanding bathtub. This home is truly at sanctuary which ever way you look at it. Can't wait till we visit again."

The air conditioning is wonderful for beating the heat, the spacious layout is great for groups and the BBQ, hot tub and outdoor deck make it perfect for family gatherings. Sarah has provided all the amenities you'll need from shampoo and conditioner to laundry detergent. I also loved her wall of books and other thoughtful touches.

26009146,326732081,2018-09-23,24607186,Jessica,We had a wonderful stay at Carolyn & William's farm. The Barn is a cosy and beautifully presented space with a huge comfy bed! It has everything you need for a short stay. The Barn is located near Angaston  and close to many of Barossa's  finest wineries and restaurants. Carolyn & William were excellent and accommodating hosts with great tips and recommendations.  We had a wonderful weekend and would definitely recommend the Barn to our friends and family!
26009146,329885665,2018-09-30,21033719,Lucy,"Carolyn was very helpful and lovely. The room is 10/10 as is the location. If you're staying a few days make sure you come prepared with small goods like milk, fruit and snacks. The room was lovely and warm and the bed comfy. Would definately go back."
26009146,331210278,2018-10-02,24955775,Monica,"The Barn is a beautiful stay in the Barossa that offers peace & quiet and a lovely view. The driveway is lined with blossoming trees, the hosts are lovely & will do anything to make your stay special. The Barn itself is fantastic - beautifully styled, huge comfortable bed & has everything you need. The toilet/bathroom is a 15m walk away on a boardwalk, so no big deal. I loved the historical aspect of it. Sunset drinks on the back deck were everything we imagined in the Barossa. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!"
26009146,333909381,2018-10-08,73654768,Amanda,"'The Barn' is a well appointed room, the host Carolyn anticipating most of your needs before you even know you have them.  Most things you'll find in your room and it's only a short well lit boardwalk across to the amenities. Would definitely stay here again!"
26009146,338993934,2018-10-21,141674557,Janelle,"The Barn is the most amazing little place to get away for the weekend. The Barn itself and facilities were so modern, new and fresh. The location is perfect and just outside Angaston where anything we needed was a small drive. Absolutely worth every penny for an adults weekend away, drink some wine, eat some cheese, visit some wineries and sights and veg out."
26009146,340418536,2018-10-23,58952949,Mark,"Carolyn is a good helpful host and is creating a charming Barossa country feel. The room is an old stone barn well renovated with beautiful linen, comfortable bed and large fun. There is a nice private outdoor sitting area with country views.
However we were disappointed on arrival to find that the barn had no running water and the new  toilet and shower were 30m away up a boardwalk in a separate building. This is rather inconvenient in the middle of a cold night! To be fair the place description did say amenities were separate but it was not clear to us that this meant no en suite and the photos did not make it clear either.This needs to be emphasised in the advert as for that price one would expect self-contained facilities. We are sure when the renovations are complete this will be a great place to stay."
26009146,341416107,2018-10-26,90911355,JoanneJasper,Absolutely beautiful location. Carolyn is incredibly helpful and quick to respond in communication and provided lovely accommodation.  The Barn is exactly as described and pictured.  Thank you for making my experience so fuss free.
26009146,343526432,2018-11-01,21036207,Anthony,Thanks for the stay! A nice quiet place to go after seeing the Barossa. Loved the bed linen.
26009146,345743728,2018-11-05,85258073,Izzy,"The Barn was truly magical and was just what we needed for a long weekend getaway. Carolyn had thought of everything in regards to amentities, from extra towels and blankets to netflix and an array of delicious teas. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the peace and quiet of the Barn. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a romantic weekend away to enjoy some wine and soak in the peace and quiet."
26009146,348705008,2018-11-15,210920152,Chloe,Our stay was amazing! I would strongly suggest anyone going to the Barossa to stay at The Barn in Penrice. Carolyn is so accomodating and the Barn is in a beautiful setting.
26009146,350660264,2018-11-19,188614999,Bradley,The Barn is a beautifully located villa type home where everything you need is catered for. A great mix of old structures but modern facilities gives this place an edge on everywhere else. Would recommend.
26009146,353852426,2018-11-29,31930771,Gonda,"Wonderful stay, great location, great view. Beautiful and comfortable. Biggest bed ever! Just perfect!"
26009146,358874535,2018-12-16,118945315,Jeremy,"Carolyn and family very friendly and room was beautiful with fresh linen, lovely soft towels and beautiful view of countryside as well as great connection to Netflix. However take care when walking to amenities as very poor lighting on path to toilet and laundry at night causing a trip hazard and suggest much improved lighting. Solar lights provide insufficient lighting at night currently."
26009146,361593099,2018-12-23,57725038,Nicolette,"We had a fantastic stay! Beautiful accommodation, great hosts!! And so close to restaurants, wineries & sites! Can’t wait to come back ... definitely recommend!"
26009146,362662157,2018-12-26,214976038,Imran,Cute space with a rustic exterior and modern interior. Surrounding renovations under way at the time of writing and as mentioned in the description. Carolyn and her family were very welcoming hosts. Highly recommend.
26009146,365011272,2018-12-31,117059183,Janine,"We loved our stay in the Barn. Such a beautiful space with gorgeous views. 
We had a lovely peaceful visit. Would definately visit again. 
Carolyn is s fantastic host."
26009146,367016599,2019-01-03,18024530,Suzette,Great location to explore the region. The pool is a welcome relief if it is hot.
26009146,400672950,2019-01-12,49680924,Hayley,"An absolutely beautiful location, room and hosts. It was perfect and I’d stay there again in a heartbeat. Thank you for making our trip to the barossa so enjoyable."

26009146,412578950,2019-02-16,47307953,Tom,"I can’t recommend Carolyn’s Air BnB enough. A welcoming host with great local knowledge that made our trip. The barn is very comfortable with a private decking to enjoy the stunning views. To top it off, Carolyn makes the best brownies! Thanks again, Tom"
26009146,420180485,2019-03-05,173156006,Don,"Highly recommended for anyone wishing to ""escape"" and find serenity.  A well thought out space, comfortable ""large"" bed and gorgeous outlook.  The toilet and shower a short stroll away from the barn wasn't a problem.  We decided to stay in each night instead of eating out as we didn't want to miss the opportunity of enjoying the sunset and relaxing in such a lovely setting.  The property is situated within an easy drive to ""everywhere"" in the Barossa but you still feel like you are in the middle of ""nowhere""!!!"
26009146,422373926,2019-03-11,228592696,Jess,"Excellent acommodation, very clean and has everything you need."
26009146,424086884,2019-03-16,236874549,Myles,Enjoyed our stay. Bed was amazing. Best bucolic view to wake up to in the morning
26009146,425755345,2019-03-19,40677124,Thomas,"Excellent and helpful host, with lots of local information for tourists. The place was spotless and serene. Sitting on that decking, watching the sun set across the hills is special."
26009146,427122639,2019-03-23,104043268,Thierry,"Beautiful peaceful retreat, and there’s a pool!"
26009146,428350296,2019-03-25,248725591,Susannah,Great Air B&B. We really enjoyed our stay here. Beautiful set up. Great communication from the hosts. Would recommend.
26009146,434492161,2019-04-08,4722430,Helen,Beautiful peaceful accommodation in Barossa Hills. Close to town and wineries. Really enjoyed our stay and appreciated suggestions from host re places to go.
26009146,436376659,2019-04-13,56014130,Miranda,The perfect little retreat for a relaxing getaway! We stayed for 3 nights and didn’t want to leave. Carolyn is a very helpful & accommodating host. The king bed is super comfy & Carolyn has the place set up so well with all of the furniture & amenities. It’s hard to beat having a glass of wine on the deck watching the sunset over the fields! The lovely & spacious toilet/bathroom/shower is only 20 steps away and wasn’t an issue at all. Can’t wait to come back & stay again.
26009146,438922690,2019-04-18,252855910,Daniela,It is a lovely little getaway in the Barossa and close to all the wineries.
26009146,440549632,2019-04-21,157104869,Kate,Was nice place & beautiful balcony & close to other towns. We didn’t have any hot water for a day so had to have a cold shower. The bathroom is away from the room and the lights walking there were very dim so was hard to see where I was walking. Also would of been good to have a sink in the room rather than have to keep walking to the bathroom area.
26009146,448119212,2019-05-04,95989465,Scott,"We had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying again in the future . Carolyn was a terrific host and made us feel very much at home . The property is ideally located a few kilometers from town and sits
beautifully in a rural setting . Highly recommended !"
26009146,470106079,2019-06-16,103196287,Maddy,"Carolyn is a great host, very easy and lovely to chat to. The gorgeous little barn house was way better then we expected, and had all the amenities so that my mum and I could enjoy a nice hot coffee and brekky in the mornings. Would recommend to anyone who's wanting to get away for the weekend!!"
26009146,516826409,2019-08-25,12693373,Astrid,"The perfect spot for a week end in the Barossa. The barn is very comfortable, the sky full of star and Carolyn and William were extremely helpful. Would definitely recommend staying there."
26009146,521465874,2019-09-01,35825460,Victoria,"Carolyn’s Barn is utterly idyllic! The perfect place for a weekend away to decompress from city life. We spent the weekend wine touring so brought bits with us for breakfast and despite its secluded location were even able to order a pizza at night! The room is very cosy, heating and a great big bed. The separate bathroom didn’t really bother us, just maybe bring your slippers so you don’t need put your shoes on every time you need to go :)"
26009146,524917641,2019-09-07,48738819,Laura,"What a wonderful accommodation! My partner and i loved how it was so homely and the short walk to the amenities weren't a problem at all! 
Carolyn gave us a range of great suggestions for what to do in the Barossa which were perfect. We spent hours driving around the Barossa valley.
Would definitely recommend the place to anyone heading to the Barossa!"
26009146,535638019,2019-09-25,63147761,Genevieve,"We had a midweek stay at the gorgeous Barn and it was the perfect spot to explore the beautiful Barossa . Comfortable bed and lovely extras, loved the coffee :) 
Thankyou to Carolyn for the local suggestions which took us to places we would not otherwise have found ."
26009146,543961017,2019-10-09,168829319,Trent,"Great location, a lot of history, easy access to the Barossa Valley wineries."
26009146,547778160,2019-10-16,89789,Sean,What a beautiful place to have spent a couple of nights at to give us access to the Barossa. Well appointed facility with all we needed. Sitting out on the patio with a bottle of red & some cheeses while the sun was setting was pretty special. Nice location to be able to get out to explore the region as well.
26009146,567595111,2019-11-22,157963239,Hilary,"We throughly enjoyed our stay, the barn was beautifully renovated with luxurious and stylish decor. It had everything we needed and was close to excellent wineries and restaurants. I would recommend this accommodation to any couple looking to experience the Barossa Valley."
26009146,568827225,2019-11-24,59082055,Samuel,"Fantastic location (close to all the wineries, food places and historical townships) just out of Angaston, the room is very private and open space with a cool layout looking out to the valley view.   The room offers everything you need and more.  If you are looking for a classy escape, this is your place with very friendly hosts.  Thank you again, Samuel & Mel."
26009146,574168269,2019-12-08,93755702,Scott,"Exceeded our expectations. We enjoyed everything about our stay. The premises, the location and the hosts were exactly what we were after. Thankyou so much."
26009146,580640210,2019-12-23,7492160,Sarah,"We had a great time at the Barn. It was peaceful and beautiful and exactly what we wanted. Close to Angaston and Tanunda which had lots of good and drink options, not to mention a winery on every corner! Carolyn and William were great hosts and gave us lots of tips for the area. Would definitely recommend the Barn!"
26009146,584316598,2019-12-29,38423802,Sophie,"Carolyn and William were amazing hosts! The Barn was absolutely lovely and beautifully fitted out. The bed was very comfortable and the amenities were great. It was lovely to sit out on the private deck and look up at the stars. Despite the heatwave while we were staying, the Barn was very cool with AC and a fan. It was also great to have a dip in the pool. The bathroom is very close and no issue to get to. There were lots of brochures and guides in the room for guests and Carolyn kindly gave us some personal recommendations, all of which we loved! The location was great for getting around the Barossa. We were really impressed with the whole experience and will definitely be back the next time we come to the Barossa."
26009146,586486749,2020-01-01,26015180,Ciara,"Outstanding hospitality, property and accomodation. Would highly recommend staying here :)"

26009146,597561297,2020-01-25,49406581,Sophie,"Honestly amazing! Couldn’t recommend staying here more.
Carolyn and William have thought of everything. So beautifully styled throughout and the location is just perfect.
Carolyn also provided us with wonderful suggestions for dinner and breakfast that we are so glad to have tried. The perfect weekend in the Barossa made so by having such a wonderful place to come back to. Thanks so much again :-)"

26009146,621185639,2020-03-29,18443973,Danielle,"The Barn is exactly as described and a lovely place to stay. Everything was immaculately clean and stylishly decorated. The facilities were great, very modern and clean. Carolyn and her partner are lovely hosts and it was a pleasure meeting them both. The night sky is outstanding in Penrice, you can see so much detail in the Milky Way. We enjoyed the local visitors too including a kangaroo, kookaburra and watching the neighboring sheep. Thanks for a relaxing stay!"
26009146,626885384,2020-05-31,5543447,Tiarne,My partner and I loved our stay at Carolyn's place. It was the perfect weekend escape and we loved all of the local tips Carolyn and William provided. We will be back!
26009146,636637062,2020-07-11,2901238,Rebecca,This little barn is beautifully finished with thoughtful touches. The French doors lead to a private deck that overlooks the rolling hills and perfect for your morning coffee. This barn has all the amenities that you’ll need. The host provided great local tips
26009146,637977431,2020-07-14,29296122,Despoina,"We had a lovely time. The Barn was warm, great views and the bed was so comfortable."
26009146,638552852,2020-07-15,349428868,Emily,Beautiful property and house that has everything you need included. Bathroom was lovely as well and very close to the house! Great hospitality and stay overall!
26009146,638863750,2020-07-17,9020740,Tom,"Awesome experience and stay. Nice and quiet, welcoming and amazing views at both day and night, highly recommended"
26009146,644079536,2020-07-30,41213038,Ben,Really nice to be just out of town with a proper country feel. The concept of building a small village is excellent and this building is a great part of it and really well done. Lovely little place for the middle of winter and a short cab ride from the nearest town. Perfect  central point for a Barossa stay.
26009146,648491736,2020-08-09,48553646,Claire,"We loved our stay here - very cosy. It was cold and rainy during our stay which made the trek to the separate bathroom a little bit tricky, but the room itself was so lovely that it more than made up for it. We would definitely stay here again!"
26009146,651752776,2020-08-16,301126355,Henry,"The photos of the Barn did not do justice to the space (I mean that in the best way possible)! It is absolutely stunning, loved that there was coffee beans and tea, the gigantic bed with heated blanket, the cordless charging ports was a special touch, the deck and outdoor space was perfect for our brunch with food from the Farmers Market. The bathroom and kitchenette was only a short walk along the pavement/deck. We had already planned out the weekend for my partners birthday, however if your stuck for ideas Carolyn was more then happy to offer local ideas and there was plenty of magazines, brochures and a home made guide book to the local area in the barn. I would absolutely recommend this place to any couple looking to get away to the Barossa."
26009146,654477670,2020-08-22,325507256,Sam,"Great Little Spot, good value for money."
26009146,655054088,2020-08-23,178518219,Jake,"Very clean, great facilities and a beautiful room! Some really nice thoughtful touches that really does make a difference. The toilet and shower is seperate to the room however still private and not really an issue! Definitely recommend when staying in the Barossa."
26009146,657161322,2020-08-27,28205126,Fletcher,"The Barn was all we hoped for, the bed was enormous"
26009146,659270274,2020-09-01,38306686,James,A great experience :)
26009146,662483185,2020-09-09,325705451,Paul,"Fantastic place to stay! The place was clean, comfortable, and had plenty of extra little bonuses such as wireless charges for phones, Bluetooth speaker, and lots of tea/coffee options. For anyone staying who is worried about having a bathroom separate to the main building, it is a VERY short distance away and was not an issue at all. Bathroom was clean and tidy, and had a fantastic shower with a rain shower head! 5 minutes drive from the main town Angeston and 10minutes to a heap of great wineries, we had a fantastic time and highly recommend this place as somewhere to stay!"
26009146,663087729,2020-09-12,365516118,Jodie,Beautiful spot to relax and forget your worries...will be back!

26009146,665906613,2020-09-19,67283505,Sven,Fantastic little place for a weekend getaway!
26009146,668950676,2020-09-28,117507273,Josh,Fantastic relaxing place to stay. Very peaceful and had everything you need to unwind. Great location and not too far from anything
26009146,671767065,2020-10-06,215121430,Milly,This place is one of the best we’ve ever stayed at. The photos really don’t do it justice; we were in awe constantly with the beautiful property. Not to mention Carolyn’s amazing hospitality too; it was the perfect stay! Will definitely be back ☺️
26009146,672012318,2020-10-07,44437622,Mim,"Beautiful space in a lovely setting in the Barossa region. The room is so comfy and beautifully styled and has everything you need. There are terraces for sitting outside the room and a covered living room space next to it where we sat with a cup of tea in the morning looking across the garden. The bathroom really is a short little hop from the room and is beautifully done with a great shower.  Carolyn is a great host, quick to communicate and gave us good tips for the area. We only stayed one night but would definitely return next time we’re in the Barossa!"
26009146,672247724,2020-10-07,89664627,Claire,Lovely little place for a quick stop over on our way to the Flinders Rangers
26009146,673078582,2020-10-10,42117032,Adelle,"Such an amazing weekend away. The most gorgeous cottage, so private. The separate bathroom is not a problem. The bed is huge and I miss it!!! Carolyn is a great host and very helpful with recommendations. STAY HERE!"
26009146,700721342,2020-10-15,239714917,Amy,"A truly beautiful barn - the space was characteristic & cosy :) Not to mention, amazing views, especially from the loo ;) Carolyn was such a welcoming, easy going and helpful host! 
My Mum was in awe of the assortment of tea provided & we both very much enjoyed the recommendation for our lunch outing! Oh & the attention to detail exceeded our expectations; from an umbrella by the door for when it drizzled and beautiful flowers around the place, everything had been thought of ! We definitely hope to visit again someday :)"
26009146,701011253,2020-10-17,31273819,Jonathan,"Great location, great communication, would recommend to others visiting the Barossa region."
26009146,701960405,2020-10-19,189593470,Alex,This is why AirBnb exists! The Barn was so comfortable and made our trip to the Barossa. The bed was huge and the heater / air con unit meant it was so cozy. It was well kitted out and beautifully designed. It was just so unique and we spent half our time eating cheese and drinking wine on the decking. We didn’t know what to expect from the outside bathroom but it only added to the experience. Getting a good look at the starry sky made it all worthwhile! Thanks to Will and Carolyn for being exceptional hosts.
26009146,702431629,2020-10-20,253545214,Pam,"Loved our two nights at ‘The Barn’, definitely worth more than a night to soak up the country amosphere. Not only is the sleeping accomodation charming and wonderfully inviting, that huge billowy bed requiring the obligatory lay in, but the cosy but spacious sitting and cooking area ‘the pug house’ is delightful to while away a comfy hour or three with a book or bottle of local wine. There are numerous dining in and take away food places open till quite late within a 10minute drive but the pug house was so inviting we shopped at the local iga and cooked a full meal both nights with the adequate facilities and soaked up the twinkling candlelit ambience. If you love to get away from it all yet have everything at your fingertips Carolyn’s is that spot. Highly recommend. Ps, the night visit to the luxury loo is a starlit wonder to behold if you don’t see the heavens often."
26009146,702836196,2020-10-22,340898695,Edward,"The Barn literally has it all!!!!not only that it is very stylish and worth every cent!!! William and Carolyn were great hosts, so helpful and offered some great tips on where to go in the Barossa.
A must stay!!!"

26009146,708103869,2020-11-10,231055717,Naomi,"I stayed at Carols Airbnb for 2 nights & the space Carol & her husband have created is perfect for a country escape or if your looking for affordable accommodation near the Barossa.
The king size bed was super comfy, the cottage & the seperate bathroom was super clean & although the toilet & shower are seperate from the cottage it was not an issue & literally just a few steps away.
The private decking area attached to the cottage is a great peaceful space to have your coffee in the morning, a glass of wine in the evening or just to sit, relax & read a book. There was a big electrical storm one of the nights of my stay in which the power was out for a few hours & Carol was quick to make sure I was ok & to see if I needed anything. Comforting considering I was staying there on my own. Thanks so much for your great hospitality Carol "
26009146,708407351,2020-11-13,44721214,Callum,"The Barn far exceeded our expectations. Carolyn met us on arrival and gave us a brief tour of the space before leaving us to relax. The bed was incredibly comfortable and we spent some time enjoying the sun and drinking wine on the outdoor patio.

Carolyn and her partner were kind enough to lend us their barbecue to make dinner one evening, and always made sure we had everything we needed. Absolutely one of our favorite AirBnb locations we have ever stayed in. We couldn't recommend this enough! Thank you again Carolyn."
26009146,709546241,2020-11-16,375344046,Bec,the barn is a lovely place to stay for peace and quiet! very earthy and pretty!
26009146,709697857,2020-11-18,4265384,Kim,"Carolyn has done a beautiful job decorating the small stone barn, the king size bed was very comfortable, the location is so quiet at night, stunning night sky to view the stars. We enjoyed having aircon, a ceiling fan, smart TV and a space to prepare simple meals. Carolyn was a great host with prompt communication."
26009146,713588662,2020-12-05,183869048,Steve,Very luxurious and relaxing spot within easy reach of everything in the Barossa Valley. Really well appointed and tastefully decorated. You don't want for anything here except a nice bottle of local wine to enjoy on the back deck. William and Carolyn are great helpful hosts.
26009146,714193245,2020-12-08,61725164,Gary,"Quirky, quiet, comfortable and  very close to Angaston yet great 'bush' feel"
26009146,715445915,2020-12-13,77866947,Natalie,"Wow wow and wow!
I’m not really one to write reviews but this little gem really is something else. 
We absolutely loved our two night stay in the barn. Carolyn has thought of everything. 
Exactly as described and even better than the pics. 
The most beautiful and comfortable big bed, seperate cooking/dining area if you wish although the beautiful little town of Angaston is only a 5 minute drive. We came for a weekend from Sydney and I just want to do it all again "
26009146,715964642,2020-12-16,175005949,Okydoky99,"Very relaxing, awesome stay.  Great hosts. Highly recommended.  "
26009146,716357639,2020-12-18,2485362,George,"Incredible accommodation, and the best Airbnb experience I've had. Carolyn and William have done an amazing job restoring the historic buildings, the photos dont do it justice.
You can simply arrive without having done any research or planning as they have included a fantastic guide to the wineries, food, tours and experiences you can do in the region. I had spent a lot of time looking into what to do beforehand and picking up their guide was much easier than searching through multiple websites. 
Can't recommend this place enough, we'll be back for sure!"
26009146,718978271,2020-12-27,374004351,Samuel,"Great place to stay while experiencing the Barossa! Very comfortable stay with beautiful outdoor areas to relax in. The barn was charming, cosy and the decor had clearly received a lot of attention to detail. Still had all the modern facilities - pretty reliable wifi, smart TV, streaming services, a portable Bluetooth speaker, A/C and a massive, comfortable bed. The back deck and outdoor couch were quite private. 

Toilet and shower were a short (and well lit) walk along the deck and were both modern and clean. Access to the pool was great during our summer stay. Carolyn and William were very hospitable and up for a chat, but certainly not overbearing. Definitely would recommend."
26009146,719556538,2020-12-29,151965846,Peter,"Delightful place in Penrice, barely removed from Angaston and Tanunda. Picturesque, cosy, so many thoughtful touches. Beautiful to look out onto the hills during the day and stars at night. Had we stayed longer we could have had a go at the pool and barbecue. Would highly recommend this to couples looking for a romantic getaway."
26009146,720630770,2021-01-01,50695818,Olivia,"Thank you very much for the lovely stay, tips and most importantly the good humour. Could not recommend the barn more highly!"
26009146,722657053,2021-01-07,25639058,Jacquie,"We had an excellent stay at The Barn and would highly recommend it. Every convenience has been thought of and attended to. The decor is beautiful, and there are a number of luxury touches: huge king sized bed, wireless phone chargers, chrome cast, Netflix and Stan, private deck in addition to the pool and bbq areas. It was really outstanding "
26009146,723585435,2021-01-11,37870187,Courtney,Beautiful little barn - lots of lovely little touches and really close to the centre of town. It was one of the hottest weekends we've had all summer and we were super comfortable. Thankyou!

26009146,734371024,2021-02-26,99815435,John,Charming accommodation.  Definitely recommend staying if you are looking for a unique experience as the bathroom is a very short distance from your room. Great for star gazing. Everything was clean and tidy with attention to the small details. We loved the the super sized king bed which was extremely comfortable. Carolyn and William were great hosts and we enjoyed watching their playful puppy and kitten playing together much like the movie “Milo and Otis”.
26009146,736007401,2021-03-02,168452054,Victor,"Highly recommended, friendly and gracious host. You will love the effort the host have put into the decor, and the little thoughtful touches dotted around the place. The rear deck is perfect for star gazing. This place has charm by the bucket loads. Don’t forget to ask the Carolyn & Mike for dining recommendations."
26009146,736354108,2021-03-05,103324160,Jem,"I was excited to stay here because it seemed interesting and looked beautiful, but it was honestly even better than I expected. Most comfortable bed ever, and I loved sitting on the deck with a wine, watching a kookaburra hop about nearby. Carolyn was very welcoming and friendly, and gave us a great suggestion for a bushwalk when she found out that's what we wanted to do. Would love to stay again."
26009146,736592353,2021-03-05,149627433,Michael,A perfect place to stay if you're visiting the Barossa. It is a good space in a nice location with great hosts.
26009146,738196985,2021-03-12,19531409,Tom,"We had a great stay, Carolyn and William were great hosts and the barn was perfect. Although you are not that far from their residence, the barn is super private with it’s own outdoor space as well as the pug lounge. Is close enough to the towns to not be inconvenient, but far enough out to escape the noise/light and to feel very secluded."
26009146,739288746,2021-03-14,202946330,Sophie,"What a perfect weekend we spent at The Barn!!! It was the most relaxing little getaway. William our host met us on arrival and gave us a tour of our weekend property. Only a short drive to Angaston which has great food options. William told us about the Farmers Market on Saturday mornings which we picked up some amazing local produce for our weekend stay. Highly recommend staying here, we will definitely will be staying here again."

Our group of two couples had ample space and the house was clean with all the amenities needed during our short stay. The house is a short walk to the town centre of Tanunda which was perfect for our dinner at Tuoi’s restaurant, FermentAsian. Tuoi was an amazing host, both at the accomodation and restaurant. I would highly recommend the accomodation and restaurant if you are travelling to the Barossa."

The yard is a great play area and the house was so clean. Tuoi was great to communicate with and really helpful with nice touches like bringing us milk and providing high chairs for us.
26403678,354491958,2018-12-02,64195,Megan,"This 3 bedroom home is a great find! The pool & backyard space was lovely & peaceful, & the kitchen was great for some self-catering. It’s also a great location in relation to the town. Tuoi was a wonderful host & we were lucky enough to dine at her brilliant restaurant, FermentAsia. We all highly recommend both."

26403678,357294555,2018-12-09,19931816,Jayne,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at 29 Jane for our wedding anniversary getaway in Tanunda. The house is tastefully decorated and the bed and sofa is very comfortable. The pool and backyard area, with its lovely greenery, is serene and relaxing. The backyard and house is suitable for a family getaway with 3 bedrooms, a well equipped big kitchen, and swings and a sandpit area in the backyard. Tuoi is a warm and helpful host, and showed us around and explained things on check-in. Thank you, again, Tuoi! My husband and I have been huge fans of Tuoi's restaurant, FermentAsian, for several years now - the food is amazingly delicious, fresh, and just a wonderful balance of South East Asian flavours. FermentAsian is one of our all-time favourite restaurants. We highly recommend both this accommodation and the restaurant.
Jayne and Glenn, Adelaide, SA."
26403678,358856529,2018-12-15,1305308,Aranie,"We had a wonderful stay at 29 Jane Place for a girls weekend. Her place is beautiful and clean, she was easy to communicate with and very warm and welcoming, and dinner at her restaurant FermentAsian was one of the standout meals on the trip. There is a lovely large well maintained backyard with a pool and we especially enjoyed the speaker system she has throughout the house as well as the pool and garden area."

We had a lovely weekend."

The kitchen was well equipped, the place spotless.  As a host, Tuoi could not be beat.  She arrived to check us in, gave us a quality bottle of wine, and made us a reservation at her restaurant, FermentAsian.

The bedrooms are all spacious with comfy king size beds. 3 bedrooms are in the main house with the 4th is in a separate, very large ensuite studio out the back. The kitchen has the basics for cooking, but if you need anything like platters or bowls you'll need to bring your own. The lounge and dining area is quite small and would be a bit of a squeeze if you had 8 people. Fantastic location close to the town centre. A perfect place to chill for our girls weekend!"

26403678,713987540,2020-12-06,233196694,Eric,"Great prompt communication and flexibility with adding another person to my booking. 

While all of the finishing and amenities provided were great there were a few basics I felt were missing. There was no tea (we bought a big box and left it) there was no basic cooking items like butter and oil (we also bought and left), and no tea towels or hand wash in the kitchen. We also bought a tea towel and left it. 

I also felt that a bbq would have been great, and the host did offer to bring one over. 

Lovely wine glasses and dishes as well as bedding and blockout curtains."
26403678,716123383,2020-12-17,331338888,Danielle,Lovely place to unwind with the family and so central to the main Street. Great facilities and beautiful pool with music system throughout the house. We all had a lovely stay and wished we could have stayed longer.

26403678,724719511,2021-01-16,179428688,Abbey,"A wonderful place to stay for a girls weekend. A quick and easy walk to the Main Street, right into town! The pool and outdoor area is a lovely addition to the home, and for those of us sharing a room the beds and amenities were spacious. 
The kitchen is very well stocked with a range of high quality cookware and appliances."
26403678,725435081,2021-01-19,246982351,Karina,Beautiful space to enjoy & relax. We loved the pool!!
26403678,726941212,2021-01-25,370239594,Michelle,"Great location, not a big area inside for 8 guests and no protection from rain outside, no platters, salad bowls, barbecue and limited kitchen items 
Pool was a life saver in the heat, but no chairs or umbrella 
House is clean, beds comfortable but broken shower screen and door, back door didn’t slide open well, fly screen torn, house needs some maintenance to bring it back up to perfect 
Air conditioning was fantastic and lots of hot water 
We felt that the cellar door was a safety hazard for kids 
We have had a rental beach house which was fantastic, so a little let down compared to what we supplied to our guests 
We also had 2 strangers walk around the back garden whilst we were there to get stuff out of the shed, no notification or knocking on the door to see if that was ok! We felt that that was quite rude"
26403678,727819861,2021-01-31,377905974,Belinda,"Lovely quaint house, close to everything. Clean, excellent facilities and delightful hostess. We would be happy to recommend. Hopefully will be able to stay there again one day."

26498571,344145935,2018-11-03,35954080,Janette,We really appreciated the heritage significance of the Goat Square Cottages. Our suite was roomy and very comfortable with modern amenities while still maintaining quaintness of another time. Kim’s cottages were in a great location. John St was close to the Tanunda shopping & restaurant area and so it was an easy walk for us. Really enjoyed our stay & hope to come back again next year. Perfect 
26498571,347174697,2018-11-11,28439114,Laura,"Fabulous location: close walking distance to centre of town, tourist info, bicycle hub, cafes restaurants.
Historic accommodation with well equipped kitchen and bathroom.
Nice garden to relax in.
We definitely would recommend and stay again.
Greatly enjoyed 1918 restaurant, Red door expressing, and hiring bikes to tour the area. Favourite wineries for ambience and meals/ picnics - Peter Lehman and Seppeltsfield (for artisans and other products."
26498571,404382225,2019-01-23,87178342,Judith,"Great little cottage, quaint and charming , thoughtfully and tastefully restored.
We had everything we needed for my husbands and my short stay.
Handy location with an easy walk into the town of Tanunda.
Would recommend if heading to the Barossa, especially in the cooler months- very cosy!"
26498571,422364033,2019-03-11,40447143,Di,"We enjoyed our stay in this historical house and would stay again. There are two other apartments. We were in the middle and terribly aware of other parties...which led to some tip toeing around late at night. Everything is provided...bread, tomatoes, milk, tea, oljve oil, bacon and eggs...and oh a bottle of gorgeous wine. Great location, very clean and king sized bed."
26498571,430568527,2019-03-31,65307634,Michael,Perfect spot for a few days in the Barossa

26498571,480484052,2019-07-03,202383583,Fleur,Kim’s Cottage is a beautiful heritage property in an historic part of Tununda. It was spotlessly clean and had a number of thoughtful touches. It was conveniently located so that you could walk to surrounding restaurants and facilities. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others.
26498571,542966834,2019-10-06,88442158,Andrew,Charming heritage cottage in the heart of Tanunda.  A pleasure to visit!

26498571,726941498,2021-01-25,49229403,Gary,"The cottage was quaint and quite well equipped. Being tall was a small issue with low door ways. It was an extremely hot night but the aircon in the bedroom did a good job.
If you want something a bit different and step back in time these 1840 cottages are the answer."
26498571,737440432,2021-03-08,244513284,Kade,"Location is great and cottage is comfortable with a nice historic feel. We would normally try to stay outside of town and did not realise when booking that this was in the think of it but we made the most of this with nice morning coffee runs to great cafes on main street and a late afternoon wine tasting at 'Artisan's of the Barossa' at the end of the street. Nice to learn a bit about the history of the town and the street as well.
Slight communication breakdown over breakfast provisions was a little disappointing but did not detract from the enjoyment of our stay.
Place is well appointed with nice clear and functional kitchen and bathroom and a comfortable bed. We would definitely go back again!"
26499552,313698815,2018-08-26,48749219,Brad,"The cottage is a wonderful comfortable space that connects you to a previous era in a contemporary way, a perfect base for exploring the Barossa. The little touches like breaky provision and wine are a lovely treat from Kim and his team "
26499552,411550615,2019-02-12,162286471,Luba,"Goat Square Cottages are a great place to stay in Tanunda , Barossa Valley as they are a wonderful part of history of the area . Centrally located , well equipped , quaint cottages and to top it off , provisions are supplied to cook a delicious breakfast for the number of days that you are staying . We loved having breakfast out in the back garden with the lovely trees and the fragrant herb garden ."

26499552,651773356,2020-08-16,19482699,Steven,"Super cozy cottage, in the absolute best location. You are within 10 minutes drive of pretty much anything in the Barossa, which helps you make the most of your time here. Also only a couple of minutes walk into the main street of Tanunda, with several fantastic restaurants and wine bars for the evening."
27065195,298083825,2018-07-29,19478403,Liesl,"Francis and Ann are wonderful, welcoming, caring hosts who have created a warm, comfortable and beautiful space for guests. The cottage is spacious and tastefully furnished, with great heating/cooling and a lovely shower. There are extra touches that add to the sense of welcome - books to read, a lovely tea pot and cups, a bench beneath a spreading oak tree. Remnant bushland is a short walk from the cottage, and a delightful place to walk and soak up the beauty of the South Australian scrub - complete with kangaroos and lots of native birds. While the cottage is close to the owners’ house, they have gone out of their way to preserve my privacy. I have truly had the most relaxing, refreshing weekend. Thank you!"
27065195,309823381,2018-08-18,198248102,Tamara,"Francis and Anne gave us a warm welcome! We immediately felt relaxed in the lovely bush land surrounding us. The cottage is sparkling clean, beautifully done and full of thoughtful little touches to make our stay comfortable. While the cottage is near the main house our privacy was respected. Anne also offered to collect pizza for our dinner so we could relax  The walking track around the property was lovely, and we awoke to kangaroos, galahs and parrots outside our door.  The forest nearby is great for exploring and the drive up from Adelaide was very scenic. An idyllic weekend escape for us. Thank you both "
27065195,312636717,2018-08-24,209399624,Maryke,"A beautiful self-contained Cottage in the South Australian countryside. Lovely facilities and very thoughtful hosts. you might want to stay a few nights, as it is such a short distance to the Barossa Wine Region. We only got to one winery and realised there was so much more to explore. Excellent if you are looking for a tranquil retreat.Thank you Anne and Francis for a memorable and very enjoyable stay."
27065195,330759860,2018-10-01,59235601,Monica,"We absolutely loved staying with Anne and Francis. It was so quiet and peaceful, and sparkling clean. We felt so welcome and our hosts were really helpful with local advice. This place isn't far from the heart of the Barossa so it's a perfect location. The wildlife on the property was an amazing bonus! Thanks so much to Anne and Francis for giving us a wonderful and relaxed weekend away"
27065195,336104512,2018-10-14,17618178,Andrew,"The cottage is cute, cosy and clean. We had a fantastic stay! The place was beautiful. Francis and Anne were very hospitable and took us for a walk around the 20 acre property and showed us their family of dogs. The cottage is out the back of the house so if you want your own privacy you can have that. We chose to interact with the hosts a lot which was really enjoyable. The porch of the cottage was a highlight, sitting there with a tea/coffee watching the birds, dogs, and nature was very peaceful. 

Highly recommended!"
27065195,340135695,2018-10-23,48732774,Hilton,"Quaint cottage in the woods - spacious timber / kit imported from Czech and with 3 way triple glazed windows, lots of light, french doors, wildlife nearby, Sheridan Linen, brand new, great shower and fittings, amenities and nice touches - flowers, chocs, etc. Awesome stay!! Near to their home but you don't feel that at all."
27065195,344527603,2018-11-03,222958891,Bec,"Francis and Anne’s place was fantastic. Woodland Cottage is in a beautiful and secluded location and the walking track was wonderful. Anne and Francis were very accommodating and helpful. We found this place to be very clean, stylish, comfortable with everything you needed and perfectly sized for two people. The bathroom and shower was excellent. Furthermore, they clearly explained the area, and offered a guided tour of the property. I honestly think this is a bargain. We would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend this beautiful cottage."
27065195,350924567,2018-11-20,66533370,Alex,A beautiful cabin with everything you need for a comfy escape. The bird life was delightful and the walks in nearby forests were relaxing and enjoyable. Thoroughly recommended
27065195,352211938,2018-11-25,137021432,Alina,"We stayed for just one night, but wish we could stay longer.  Francis and Anne were most welcoming and cordial.  The cottage is sparkling clean and fresh, well equipped for tea/coffee and a light breakfast or snack (microwave, toaster, kettle and a small fridge).  The hosts attend to it with great attention to detail.  The bed is comfortable with high quality linen and towels.  Some chocolates and the fresh flowers were a nice touch.  
In the middle of the bush and near Mt Crawford forest, the air is  clean and fragrant, pleasure in every breath.  Several options for a nice walk right around, and plenty more of really picturesque walks within a short drive.   
A nice added bonus is the joy of watching the amazingly playful puppies (though they are already much bigger than most dogs we ever met).  Thank you Francis and Anne!"
27065195,367894160,2019-01-05,200561384,Donna,"Thankyou Francis and Anne for allowing us to stay at your lovely cottage at such short notice.  For such a short holiday it served its purpose well.  So peaceful and calming amongst the native bush and wildlife.   We loved all the extra touches and your hospitality as hosts was exceptional.  Will definitely come back again at another time of year to see the changes in the flora and fauna.   Thankyou,   Donna and Michael."

27065195,469573142,2019-06-15,28913374,Anne,"A wonderful cabin set on the boundary between Adelaide Hills and Barossa makes for a great go between if you want to visit both in a short period of time. While it’s away from any amenities- it suited us perfectly as we could see the stars, woke up to kanagarooa and birds and could feel totally unplugged. Francis and Anne were very attentive and made sure we were settled and happy- super hosts!"

The path through the bush block is beautiful. We had a great lunch at Casa Carboni in Angaston,  went for local walks, and went to the excellent Mt Pleasant farmer's market. Francis is a generous host whose love for, and knowledge of the local bush is obvious."

Ann and Francis were the perfect hosts; they were nearby for anything we needed. So say that we enjoyed their nature trail would be an understatement - what an amazing place they have. We're already planning our next visit and are very much looking forward to seeing Ann and Francis again as we enjoyed their company so much! Thank you for having us at your place!"

Thank you"
27065195,721235032,2021-01-02,6037682,Valentina,"An absolutely sensational place - set in a peaceful, natural bush setting with the delightful sounds of native birds in the background.  
After a frantic year we were looking to completely unwind.  I spent hours reading on the propert and when we felt like it we just jumped in the car and were minutes away from all that Barossa has to offer.   We also loved how we could easily reach the Adelaide Hills via some beautiful scenic driving.  
The cottage is adorable and spotless with a fridge and toaster and microwave.  Francis and Anne are fabulous hosts, it felt like we were staying with dear friends but had the privacy of your own space.  Francis provided some fabulous local insights.
We are delighted to have stayed here and hope to return next year again!"
27065195,722666338,2021-01-08,290105348,Nick,"Beautiful cottage. Francis was very kind and helpful in providing information about the surrounding area and also showing us the cottage.

27065195,723585893,2021-01-11,360106164,Georg,"Francis' place is perfect if you're looking to get out of town to somewhere very quiet, and is a good location for access to the Barossa and Adelaide Hills. The setup is very simple but functional and Francis was a lovely host with an excellent knowledge of local orchids."
27065195,725134782,2021-01-18,11076373,Tim,Peaceful and relaxing weekend away! Thank you!
27065195,725428048,2021-01-18,252700310,Peter,"Francis’s immaculate cottage is an ideal place for a quiet and secluded stay in a rural setting. It is well maintained, clean and well appointed  for a comfortable, peaceful and enjoyable stay. Francis is readily on hand for any problems, queries or tips on activities, sights etc as he is a long term resident with an intimate knowledge of the area. We highly recommend it!"
27065195,726080748,2021-01-22,28667238,Mary,"Normally I will search in the higher price bracket in AirBnb listings to stay in a quality environment and quality accommodation. This place is way too inexpensive for what is on offer. Where do I start? Small but roomy cottage in beautiful bush environment, secluded and rural but with the owners in the house separate but alongside you feel safe and secure. Francis and Anne respect your privacy but will give you a warm welcome and be available if you have any questions. Thank you Francis for sharing your valuable knowledge and expertise and thank you Anne for your cheery and friendly chat. This is an environment where nature is respected. Now to the cottage... Very cute, impeccably clean, TV reception good, great shower, comfy bed. As for the environment it is paradise, bird song and various species sighted and/or heard. Private outdoor sitting area. No kitchen sink/stove etc but microwave/toaster/jug is all you need. After all a true holiday is no cooking lol! Nice shower, good air-conditioning. Memories of sitting outside at dusk listening to nature with a glass of red in hand. This place has got to be the best value listing on Airbnb and we've been to a few!"
27065195,726282303,2021-01-23,65329841,Melissa,"What a beautiful space Francis has created. We had a lovely stay and felt completely at home. Francis was very welcoming and ensured we had all that we needed. I must say, the bed was particularly comfortable, which was a pleasant surprise, as Airbnb accommodation doesn’t always provide this. Thank you."
27065195,726703692,2021-01-24,304975458,Theo,Nice cute cottage
27065195,729120968,2021-02-05,96051463,Laura,As a single female traveller I felt very safe staying in this wonderful cottage. It was a rather exciting stormy night and I loved listening to the sounds of the wind and rain whilst tucked up in the most comfortable bed. I also very much enjoyed a short walk around the woodland and spotted some kangaroos. Thank you so much to this wonderful couple for a lovely night away and for their plentiful tips to explore the Barossa valley.
27065195,729319906,2021-02-06,33491169,Mel,"We enjoyed a 1-night stay at Francis's little cottage which consists of a main room with bed, two armchairs, table, and kitchenette, as well as a spacious bathroom overlooking a large oak tree and gardens. Francis was very welcoming and responsive to our questions. We enjoyed being immersed in the landscape - the sound of rain on the roof, smells of the eucalypts as we walked along their bush track, the rooster crowing at dawn, the friendly howls and barks of the beautiful Wolf Hounds, and the family of wood ducks waddling past for a feed. While it may not be everyones cup of tea, we would definitely stay there again."
27065195,729769567,2021-02-07,386795052,Olivia,"Amazing stay!! Anne and Francis' little cottage is gorgeous and they are incredibly friendly hosts.

27065195,734616322,2021-02-26,121144892,Byron,"All the reviews are true. Lovely hosts, lovely little cottage. 

It is an out of the way location. Some will love this, some won’t.  No kitchen, no wifi, not great mobile reception. If this isn’t your thing then don’t book and then complain."
27065195,736348110,2021-03-04,18442179,Gerrit And Laila,"Francis and Anne made us a feel at home, they are very approachable and gave us great  suggestions and recommendations. The cottage is  spotless and is situated in a quiet bush setting with a beautiful walk on the property itself. it is the perfect location to explore the Barossa Valley and Hanhdorf.

27271141,363057830,2018-12-27,51750584,Tennekoon,"This comfortable and spacious house is located in a quiet town near the Adelaide Hills and Barossa Valley.  It is well equipped and has all the amenities required, including central AC which was very handy during the hot summer days. There are beautiful scenic drives around the area.

27271141,597566581,2020-01-25,144558802,Tegan,"location  - perfect. We cooked the breakfast supplied on the BBQ and it was... perfect. Erika's place is in the middle of blissful serenity. Close enough to the big towns for wine tasking. Close enough to the local pub to be away from it all. All the thoughtful details are catered for. Clean, comfy... perfect. Close to coffee, food and wine. My recommendation is a trip to the markets or a local supermarket, local cheese, local wine and enjoy an early night in"

The home is spacious and met our needs.  

Breakfast provisions were very good.

A washing machine and dryer was available which we found useful as we stayed for 4 nights.

We would certainly recommend the house if your travels take you to the southern Barossa."

27409406,703452575,2020-10-25,169982599,Catherine,Very peaceful place to stay. Was happy to hide away from the world and enjoy wine from the local wineries. Loved the extra touches of Michael's produce from his farm.
27409406,712083682,2020-11-29,15989418,Bethany,"We thoroughly enjoyed our time at The Dairyman. Michael was an excellent host, who was generous with his hospitality. We were impressed with his work to convert certain buildings into comfortable and stylish accommodation.

The produce from the farm is absolutely delicious, and the opportunity to walk around the property and meet the animals will remain memorable."
27409406,723140525,2021-01-09,323390327,Shaun,"The Dairymans Cottage is the ideal weekend getaway in the Barossa. Situated  a short drive from local wineries and restaurants its country charm is a refreshing break. Michael and his staff provide a warm and inviting environment in which he happily shares his knowledge of sustainable farm living. The local produce provided is straight from paddock to plate, offering a great opportunity to enjoy the most delicious food in the area. The cottage itself is neat, tidy and tucked away to provide a relaxing connection to the country, with all the amenities expected in a fancy hotel. We were greeted by the most loving ‘red dog’ who visited us every so often just to check in on our stay. We will definitely be back in the future!"
27409837,541853725,2019-10-05,4526333,Vivian And Neil,"My review will look like the first review of Dairyman’s Cottage on Airbnb but lots of reviews on (Website hidden by Airbnb) which was very helpful.
Like most reviews we found the breakfast provisions outstanding and was really the highlight of our stay.
From Michael’s farm fresh to us, we had fresh eggs, pasteurised butter milk, fantastic farm butter, sliced leg ham, cured prosciutto, bacon, pork sausages. We also had locally produced camembert, fantastic bread by local baker Eleni (Website hidden by Airbnb) breakfast oats, dried fruit, nuts and dark chocolate on the table when we arrived. What a bounty. 

We picked the 2 bedroom cottage - ideal for 2 couples with 2 bedrooms with QB each with modern ensuites. The beds  and pillows were very comfortable.

It is located in the heart of the Barossa with tons of great wineries within a 30 minute drive. The Barossa Farmer’s Market about 30 minutes away is very worthwhile visiting with high quality produce including Dairyman’s Barossa produce on show and Eleni’s bakery (the croissant was very buttery and delicious too). The Market is only open Saturday mornings 7.30am to 11.30am.  We bought lots of cheeses, preserves, dried fruit - great gifts to take home.

It was our first farm stay and we had a great experience. We watched Charly milk the cows, Michael feed the pigs- free range heritage pigs - were fed milk and oats. 3 of the chickens would roost near our cottage and Charly would find eggs around the milking shed. Ruby the dog was a friendly addition. Thank Michael. You’re an excellent responsive host!"

Michael was so accommodating and gave us produce from the farm on arrival which was absolutely delicious!   Thanks for a little insight into your country life, for showing us around the farm and letting us help with the animals.  Great farm stay experience that we will visit again.  Will likely see you at the Adelaide farmers market in the near future so we can pick up some more yummy produce!"

The location on a working dairy farm amongst vineyards is interesting and with the added benefits of fresh eggs, butter, milk, bacon and more! The Barossa and Eden Valleys are on your doorstep, with many excellent wineries and restaurants within a short drive. We also explored the Hale Conservation Park and the Little Kaiserstuhl Walking Track. Highly recommend."

The villa itself was beautiful, with lovely linen and a stunning bathroom with an excellent spa bath. 
The view was spectacular and sitting out on the little deck with the local wine and cheese we collected during the day was a perfect end to the day. 
Amazing photo opportunities and it is so private.
If you need help Nelly is happy to help but on the other hand if you like your privacy he is more than respectful of this. 
Would definitely recommend staying here. Perfect for a romantic couples get away and some quiet time."
27814606,347109946,2018-11-10,80844084,Michael,"Nelly and Guido, thank you so much for the amazing opportunity to stay in your spectacular accommodation. 

Your stays were exactly what we need when visiting the Barossa for our friends wedding. 

Conveniently located at the start of the Barossa Valley trail, close to everything and the overall easy of getting to and from your place was so great.

The amenities and presentation of the accommodation was perfect, my partner and I can’t complain about a thing, you have certainly thought of everything; from superb linen to dual shower and a spa all overlooking the gorgeous vineyard. 

Ultimately congratulations on such an amazing stay. We will be highly recommending your stay to friends and family when they visit."

The place was open and airy, very clean and had everything we could ask for. Steve was available if we needed him, but wasn’t in your way at all.

Highly recommended Steve’s house as a base for a tour of the Barossa / Eden Valley."

27819034,403464043,2019-01-20,236634577,Steve,"Steve's place is clean, spacious, the bed is comfortable and there are some great mountain views. The distance from the town centre is perfect and the hosts are very welcoming but not in your face. My only criticism would be that, as this is a home based condiments production business, there is some early morning noise from vehicles etc. which may annoy those who are not early risers."

It is more of a home industry stay than a farm stay though and is situated close to a freight route so there was some traffic noise. Close to lots of wineries and a great cycling area.

The location is absolutely perfect if you want to stay in the heart of Barossa and easily reach everything around in less than 20 minutes. Nights were starry and quiet while we were sipping a glass of wine, tastings Zimmy's treats, admiring vineyards from our window. The accommodation was clean and neat and even more spacious than the pictures were showing. We took advantage of the kitchen that was well equipped.  Highly recommended."
28843427,541881514,2019-10-06,4943048,Leah,"My husband and I stayed at Karina’s for a weekend getaway. It was lovely, close to the centre of Tanunda and easily accessible to all the highlights of the Barossa Valley. The extra touches of fresh milk, the very generous continental breakfast and the cheese and wine were really appreciated.  The enclosed private garden is a gorgeous place to sit in the morning or afternoon with the established garden. While the studio apartment is located on the same ground as the owners residential property it still felt private. Thanks Karina!"

We were able to check in early and start exploring which was amazing. The house was beautifully presented, immaculately clean and a lovely welcome note with beautiful platter, wine (which you could also buy more of), dried meats and cheese ready for us on arrival. Lovely breakfast and room amenities were all top notch. Very comfortable bed to top it all off. We will be back!"

It was immaculately clean, in the perfect location and was very stylish. We were treated to a beautiful platter on arrival with delicious cheeses, meats etc as well as a lovely bottle of wine. Check in was a breeze and Karina was very speedy in replying to messages, giving recommendations when we asked where we should have lunch. The bnb had its own private courtyard and while it was a little chilly for us to enjoy it, it would be lovely to enjoy once the weather warms up. We were pleasantly surprised by the selection of breakfast items that were available for us to enjoy, as well as fresh fruit and bread and homemade biscuits and jam. We would highly recommend this to anyone looking to get away for a couple of days, next time we would love to stay for even longer!

The location was prefect, a little off the beaten track but still close enough to walk to local restaurants and wineries. Must add a little shout out to Langmeil Winery both staff and wines were amazing and only a 10 minute walk. If you decide to drive try"

We really appreciated all the local information and flyers available to us and I loved the flowers in the bathroom - a beautiful personal touch.  The space was cosy and comfortable. Everything was spotless and very welcoming and the courtyard garden was a mini paradise.  The birdlife in the mornings made my heart sing.  It didn't bother us that we weren't super close to the main road - the Barossa needs to be seen by car anyway so wasn't a problem at all. Would highly recommend this lovely studio.

Little touches like the grazing platter as you arrive and your choice of a delicious bottle of red or white wine from the region made all the difference. The little bunch of flowers  in the bathroom also made us smile  The studio was beautifully clean with a lovely outdoor garden area to sit and enjoy the wine and food platter  As for the location, that was perfect too, as we were close to amazing restaurants as well as just a short drive to all the surrounding vineyards and local attractions like Maggie Beer’s Farm Shop. Thanks again for being our wonderful hosts "

The bed and couch overlook the nice big windows out to the front garden which was lovely.

Nice and close to the township, we visited the Roaring 40s for dinner (excellent pizza!) and The Company Kitchen for breakfast (wonderful food - didn’t need lunch!).

It was nice to be able to use a kitchenette to prepare basic snacks & breakfast. 

The area we used was very private with a nice outdoor setting that we used when the weather allowed. It was an easy & pleasant walk into Angaston for dinner. 

This is the perfect place to stay for guaranteed quiet, clean & comfortable accommodation."

The space was set up perfectly, we were a family of 5 staying (one in a port a cot) and the kids all had their own little space to retreat to and the place was lovely, new and very clean. We only stayed one night, I probably wouldn’t stay here with all my children for a week but for a couple with one or two kids it’s definitely worth the stay. They have thought of everything to make the space functional. Located in a gorgeous area of Angaston too :) thanks for the lovely stay!"

29192273,442960393,2019-04-24,4570278,Talia,"Positioned perfectly in the Barossa, just the next street over from the main street in Tanunda. We were honoured to be the first guests that Cory had in his sparkling newly renovated house with all of the mod cons. Check in was a breeze using the code keypad lock. Cory has tastefully renovated his house but it was the small things I really appreciated. Proper sized wine glasses, little Nespresso style machine with complimentary pods, Netflix(!), olive oil + balsamic in the pantry and most importantly, the amazing guest book! Perhaps the only AirBnB guest book that I've actually wanted to read and flip through. Beautifully presented with amazing information about the region and of course wine! Favourite part was the ghost stories at the back. Next level! Cory is a thoughtful and considerate host. We hope to come back for our next Barossa visit!"
29192273,444378720,2019-04-28,49574020,Briony,"Thanks for having us Cory! 
Your place was absolutely perfect to stay at while we explored the Barossa. Location is so convenient to the town and wineries, the house is clean, modern and very comfortable. Communication for check-in and check-out was faultless. And the book of information supplied with local recommendations as well as the history of the region and facts about the wine industry was such an amazing touch.  
We will be back for sure!!"

The place itself is stunning, really well furnished and styled. Some lovely touches on arrival, including a bottle of red that went down a treat as well as a great guidebook for the area!

We used the local taxi service to get to some wineries and avoid the rain showers but the town is easily walkable.

Cory even sorted us out with a later checkout which made the last morning a lot easier!

Recommend Cory’s place a lot. Thank you."

Our ‘home away from home’ was ideal for us, travelling with an elderly parent, who could be very particular but was very impressed. Top points for comfort and cleanliness! Close to the main road but very quiet especially at night! A short drive to the main street was also very convenient for a quick trip to the supermarket (which had it all) but also very charming town."

It is a short 5 minute walk to the main street for pubs, restaurants and shops and the township of Angaston is charming.
We were supplied with generous breakfast groceries for both days and Lydia was efficient in her communication leading up to our stay. There was also extensive information at the cottage about the house, restaurants, tours and wineries.

29557043,344533187,2018-11-03,47431160,Tatiana,"Nelly's place is amazing, it has all of the comfort you would expect and amazing luxuries. My husband and I spent a weekend at this place, we were seeking a relaxed and romantic base from which to explore what the Barossa has to offer. It was a fantastic experience. Communication and check in was easy, any issues had were quickly fixed.  Thank you Nelly and Guido for your warm hospitality."
29557043,444368952,2019-04-28,12274541,Claire,"I brought my husband to the Barossa as a surprise for his 30th birthday and we chose to stay at Nelly and Guido's gorgeous Country Cottage while we were visiting. We honestly could not have wished for more, the venue itself was gorgeous, overlooking vineyards with a wonderful sunrise outlook (which is a must for at least one morning of your stay) and all the amenities you need for a comfortable stay. The thing that was really outstanding though was Nelly and Guido's hospitality. The communication beforehand was seamless, early check in was no problem, the provided us with extra coffee pods when we ran out and Nelly even kindly drove us to dinner on my husband's birthday dinner at Lyndoch Hill which I think is reflective of the kind of generosity one experiences all over the Barossa. We couldn't rate our stay at the Country Cottage more highly and can't wait to visit again!

Regarding the location, Lyndoch is around 20 minutes from Tanundra which is the real heart of the Barossa and we did have to drive everywhere. (There are options to use some bike trails but it would have been around a 28km round trip and it would have made it difficult to carry all the wine we bought!). You can't really get around the Barossa without driving so with that in mind, I'm glad we stayed in Lyndoch rather than Tanundra because it puts you in the path of many excellent wineries including St Hallet's, Rockford, Hemera, St Hugo and many more."
29557043,456206655,2019-05-21,260373520,Christian,A beautiful cottage set in a beautiful location overlooking one of Lyndoch's beautiful vineyards! Nice and close to most wineries and restaurants. We had a great stay in May of 2019 and would definitely consider booking with Nelly again when we decided to visit the Barossa again.
29557043,511891263,2019-08-18,135172773,Joseph,"My now Fiancé and I had an absolute amazing time. Perfect place for me to get down on my knee and ask that big question under the rotunda.

Nice and close to everything in the Barossa and definitely somewhere we will be back to enjoy. 

Thank you again Kelly and see you soon"
29557043,554738683,2019-10-26,223922054,Michael,"Nelly's place was brilliant for us - the location is incredibly picturesque, the amenities (especially the bathroom!) are really luxurious and Nelly was super easy to deal with.  Thanks for a great stay!"
29557043,645439557,2020-08-02,33416216,Katina,My partner and I stayed here for a weekend away in the Barossa and we honestly could not fault our time at Nelly's cottage. The photos truly do not do it justice and our expectations were exceeded in every way! The view and location of the cottage itself were incredible. The bathroom and Spa were sparkling clean and an absolute luxury to have...Everything that you could possibly need had been thought of and provided. The bed was one of the comfiest we had both ever slept in. We would highly recommend  staying here. Nelly was an incredible host who went and above to accomodate our needs. Thank you Nelly!

It's located at the heart of Tanunda so pretty convenient. Walking distance to some great restaurants. My parents took a nice walk around and discovered amazing views along the road.

Jodie is so friendly and nice. She had everything prepared before our arrival and offered some great tips. Thanks to her we really enjoyed our Barossa trip.

The house was secure, warm and cosy with good heating, a lock up garage to put your car in, and very quiet. The check in process was a breeze, and communication easy. The location is second to none, being right off the main street and walking distance to restaurants and supermarket. We had a plumbing issue our first morning, but Jodie was on to it immediately and it was fixed quickly. She even offered an extended checkout to compensate, but we were hardly inconvenienced.

Only a few houses from Tanunda's main street and many excellent restaurants, wine bars and shops, Jodie's house is spacious, beautifully presented and set up with everything you could need. Jodie was a fabulous host, providing a very welcome basket of goodies for breakfast and coffee pods for the Nespresso to get us all going! The kitchen was well stocked with crockery and pans etc so we could easily cook our own meals. We didn't use the laundry but it looked fully stocked also. The bed was really comfortable and Jodie provided plenty of pillows, cushions and extra blankets, as well as coat hangers in the wardrobes.

The house is in the perfect location with the best bakery pies just across the road.  Supermarket around the corner, coffee shops (so good!) and restaurants all walking distance.  Note:  we took our elderly father so little things matter.  There was a good strong chair with solid arms for him to sit in and watch TV.  He could get in and out of it easily.  There are NO steps leading into or inside the house. And the showers do not have steps or a step over either.  Everything was perfect! Highly recommended."

29783445,438927536,2019-04-18,122248237,David,We highly recommend Figtree Cottage if you are looking to stay in the Barossa. The cottage is very clean with lovely touches. The cottage garden is very well kept and has beautiful autumn colours in April.

However it was not worth the price and had a number of issues; including mice, no working fireplace (the only reason I even got the place) and some practical issues (like bedroom doors that didn’t close, no hanging spaces, and no full length mirror). I couldn’t say I’d recommend the place - at least at this price or until they get rid of the mice."

29783445,535240682,2019-09-24,23153109,Linda,"A good location for touring in the Barossa, it has off street parking.  The beds are very comfortable and the bathroom and kitchen fairly recently updated, the bedrooms are lacking in storage and probably better suited to shorter stays for couples without too much luggage. 

The cottage is old and historic with a pretty garden, it would be ideal for sitting outside on warm days and there are lots of places nearby to eat, although some a little pricey we found.  We enjoyed our cooking course at Casa Carboni and bought fresh local cheeses  next door to enjoy with some Barossa reds."

What a beautiful stay in a beautiful town!

29783445,649243078,2020-08-10,70109345,Esther,"This was such a wonderful place to stay. Jonathon and Kate were really easy to contact, and the cottage was beautiful. The wood fire was amazing and kept the lounge room and main bedroom warm over night. We loved the historic charm of the place, and the bath and shower were both really nice (the shower has a great water pressure, which I appreciate). Angaston is also a great spot which is close to heaps of good places to eat. This place has everything you need for a cosy weekend away!"
29783445,650685148,2020-08-14,117828099,Ellysa,"Lovely little cottage on the Main Street of Angaston. Was a little loud in the morning as cars/trucks frequent the area, but was a good wake up call! We loved the breakfast options in the cottage. We really enjoyed using the fireplace. The garden was so cute, unfortunately it was raining so we didn’t get to spend as much time outside as we would have liked! Thanks again for the lovely stay."

29783445,655804155,2020-08-23,57223672,Kelsey,"This is a lovely cosy cottage within walking distance of the town . 
It is on a reasonably busy road with the main bedroom at the front but it certainly didn’t spoil our visit but worth a mention if you want a really quiet spot . We had lots of fires in the sitting room and there were oil heaters to keep us warm . 
Cute and quirky this place is furnished with vintage pieces with clean heritage style kitchen and bathroom. There are pretty views out of every window and the gardens are beautiful."

The fireplace was also lovely for the cool nights in early Spring. The mattresses were particularly comfortable. The cottage is located on the main street in Angaston, so was just a short walk to nearby restaurants and shops. Overall we had a lovely time staying here."

We really enjoyed our stay - the fire was lovely, and so we’re the extras in the house like jams, milk and bread. If you’re cooking at in the cottage like we were, it would probably be useful to take a few oven/baking dishes with you.

Jonathan and Kate were always quick with responses and very accomodating of our requests. It’s a great location, super clean and perfect for a  short weekend away."

It is stylish and light filled-exactly what I want my holiday home or retirement cottage to look like (insert heart eye emoji here). It has everything you need if you’re staying in the Barossa for while (drying rack, washing machine etc). Kate and Jonathan were always just a message away if you need anything. Highly recommend!"
29783445,738193146,2021-03-12,34543886,Jane,"Fig Tree Cottage was a perfect place to base ourselves whilst we were doing some work in the Barossa. It is stylish and practical, very comfortable and spacious. We loved all its period features. And that garden! Sitting under the big tree having lunch one day was my idea of perfection; cool, green, lots of birds visiting. Fabulous! The light-filled bathroom is gorgeous. Having a washing machine is always a bonus when you're travelling for a while. Internet connection was very good. What a wonderful place to stay for work - or a holiday! We hope to return. Thank you so much Kate and Jonathan. Cheers!"
29975093,365003570,2018-12-31,9240607,Paul,Fantastic little cottage full of period features and right in the Main Street. You won’t be disappointed if you stay her!

29975093,427099373,2019-03-23,121918627,Leeanne,Gorgeous and quaint cottage very well located walking distance to everything.
29975093,432414129,2019-04-03,129811770,Kate,"If you want something a little left of centre then this is the place for you. So well appointed with lots of thoughtful little extras. Comfortable, clean and quirky. The second bedroom is a thoroughfare to the lounge and the place is on the Main Street so at peak times there is vehicle noise. Neither of these points would hinder us staying again as the good definitely outweighed any negative."
29975093,436775123,2019-04-14,141476944,Ann,A great location in a very historic cottage and town. Old world charm with every modern convenience. Lots of room and every comfort for the weary traveller.

29975093,482769587,2019-07-07,15069841,Sophie,"Cute home. Great location, walked to the brew house down the road.  Lovely breakfasts supplied. I would say if you were staying with 4 people that one bedroom you have to travel between the living room and the kitchen so the other guests would have to walk through. I wouldn’t like that myself. Thanks for the great stay."

29975093,536495825,2019-09-26,162761437,Alana,"My partner and I had an amazing stay at Johann’s Cottage. The location was perfect, we could walk into the main shopping area of Tanunda within two minutes and were perfectly situated to explore all parts of the Barossa. Mark and Tanya were very thoughtful and left a lovely hamper for us. Would definitely recommend Johann’s Cottage to anyone who is visiting the Barossa Valley."
29975093,540665508,2019-10-04,158885245,Daniel,"Tanya & Mark’s place is perfect for checking out the Barossa. It’s a short walk to the Main Street and makes it easy to drive to different wineries. Being on the main road however, you do get the traffic noise.

They are very generous hosts, giving us a gift basket and bottle of wine to enjoy as well as easy to communicate with. After locking ourselves out of the house, they were very kind and dropped off a spare set for us to get back in, thanks again Mark and Tanya."
29975093,552075336,2019-10-20,23198926,Emily,Great location to get you everywhere you need to go in the Barossa. The breakfast laid out is a life saver after a full day of wine tastings. The shower is a little hard for taller people (like myself) to get around. Tanya & Mark gave great recommendations for the location which were super helpful! Thanks again!
29975093,561713776,2019-11-09,57186449,Maggie,"Tanya & Mark have created a very comfortable and stylish accommodation at Johann's Cottage. This place is very well-located, beautifully furnished and sparkling clean. Highly recommended."

The location is perfect, walking distance to everything in Tanunda. The bed and pillows are super comfortable, so important for a restful vacation. Expect traffic noise during the day, as you are right on the main road, but lovely and quiet at night, not disturbed at all!! So many helpful brochures and information included in the house, loads of reading and games to entertain yourself. A very lovely place to stay, highly recommended. Thanks Tanya and Mark"

29975093,668265624,2020-09-27,326623542,Nichola,"The hosts have thought of everything regarding personal touches. There were cereals, snacks, water, milk and a bottle of wine with a personal message as it was my Birthday .The cottage is located on the main road which makes it easy to access all the amenities but it can be a little noisy especially on Sunday mornings with the church bells from the local churches. The cottage was clean and tidy  but some of the facilities were  a bit dated."
29975093,671413884,2020-10-05,317008758,Kim,Lovely spot.  Very convenient for shops and restaurants in Tanunda.  Lovely extra touches from the hosts.  Cottage was built in 1860 and had a great charm about it.
29975093,706042197,2020-11-01,10904727,Laura,Really well located cottage with a lot of nice touches throughout. Very spacious. Tanya and Mark were very quick at responding

29975093,721238083,2021-01-03,256980793,Alyssa,"This quaint little cottage would be perfect for those looking to soak up some history in the Barossa. It’s a lovely little place with antique furniture throughout but lacked a few of the modern creature comforts we’ve come to rely on. For example, there isn’t wifi (it’s our own fault for not checking this beforehand), it was very warm in the house in the middle of summer and unfortunately the single air conditioning unit didn’t quite cut it, there aren’t powerpoints where you might expect, like by both beds (as we’ve come to rely on for phone charging unfortunately) and the shower was quite average (especially for my 6’3” husband). These small things won’t matter to everyone so I’m sure many will still love their stay here."
29975093,722913987,2021-01-09,47308317,Leonie,"Lovely cottage within easy walking distance to cafes and restaurants.  Beautifully furnished with period furniture right down to old photographs.  Plenty of good reading material on hand.  It was generously stocked with all you need, even a picnic hamper!  Would recommend the cottage to anyone planning a visit to the Barossa. Mark & Tanya are generous hosts."
29975093,724722523,2021-01-16,231025113,Dale,"Fabulous central location. Interesting and comfortable home and generous hosts who leave a basket of treats to enjoy. In the height of summer the air-conditioner struggled to stretch to the second bedroom but there is a fan available. Be mindful that the shower is over the bath and there are small steps throughout the house, but if you mobility is good, you'll enjoy this beautifully furnished home."

30094352,364997400,2018-12-31,225993015,Natalia,"As I walked in on a hot day, the air con was already on and music was playing on the retro radio. Loved everything about this place - could not have asked for more, from the yummy breakfast provisions, wine,cookies.... to the super comfortable bed and amazing shower. Even the outhouse toilet was luxurious. Everything was truly perfect - and I’m very fussy! I loved it so much I extended an extra 2 nights and lucky for me it was available - hope to be back one day"
30094352,400377451,2019-01-11,233231345,Dave,"Angaston is a beautiful town in the Barossa Valley. We thought the accommodation was amazing and the little touches made
it feel like a home away from home. All credit goes to Sue and Mike for making us feel very welcome...we cant recommend  
The Rusty Olive enough!"
30094352,417056840,2019-02-25,155719951,Jessica,"Sue and Mike’s place was absolutely beautiful. When I arrived the cottage was exactly like it is in the pictures, very cute and absolutely spotless.
I didn’t have any issues sleeping as the cottage very private and located on a quiet street, so there were no issues with noise. Also, the bed is absolutely huge and so comfortable! The bathroom is also very luxurious, especially the huge bathtub, and I really enjoyed using the rain shower.
The included gourmet breakfast was very extensive and delicious. The kitchen itself was very well equipped; with everything I needed to cook if I needed to.
I only stayed for one night, but I did notice the barbeque out the back which I would have loved to try if I had more time. The private outdoor area was really beautiful and would have been a nice place to sit and spend some time or eat a meal if I had stayed a few extra nights. The cottage also had an outhouse toilet that I thought was kind of quirky but also very cool. 
The cottage itself is just around the corner from the main street of Angaston, so access to restaurants, cafes and shops is super simple – just a few minutes walk from the cottage. The hosts also provided a heap of great information on other activities and dining options around the Barossa which really helped me plan activities for my trip.
Overall, I thought the cottage was incredibly beautiful and clean and definitely worth the price. I wouldn’t hesitate to book again if I was staying in the area."

30094352,459101082,2019-05-27,22381354,Letitia,"This cottage is everything you could was from a Barossa BnB. Rustic and charming, yet incredibly clean and with all of the mod cons you would expect. 

Every detail has been considered and this attention to detail and comfort did not go unnoticed. 

Highly recommend."
30094352,464976982,2019-06-07,146406251,Lisa,"As soon as you drive into the drive of this unique cottage you will be in awe. Not only will you be stepping into a past era with the style of the home but it has been brought back lovingly into today with the practical ammenities we’ve become used to. A huge comfy king size bed, beautiful linen to match the era of the home, stylish kitchen and the bathroom is amazing.  This property is immaculately presented and the homeliness is immediately felt. Well done Sue and Mike in the lovingly restoration of “the rusty olive”."

The attention to detail and added special touches would put some 5 star hotels to shame. The cottage is exactly like it is in the pictures and absolutely spotlessly clean. Communication with Sue & Mike was prompt and straightforward.  Check in was easy. The Rusty Olive’s location  (on a quiet street – no road noise) is ideal as a base from which to explore the Barossa Valley. It is excellent value for money and I would recommend it to anyone travelling to the Barossa for a weekend away."
30094352,484503121,2019-07-09,86024848,Nadia,"The Rusty Olive was absolutely beyond perfection. The attention to detail made it a divine, luxurious stay from the bathbombs and bedside chocolates to the Nespresso coffee machine and local condiments..... everything was of the highest quality and made our week long stay all the more comfortable and enjoyable.
The convenient location made it perfect for exploring the Barossa’s many, MANY Cellar Doors, as well as the Farmers Market, burning vines  and other wonderful offerings this region has.

This cottage is amazing, with everything you need for a really comfortable stay. Sue and Mike included lots of thoughtful touches like breakfast goodies, leaving the lights on as we arrived late, they even had face wipes and dry shampoo in the bathroom! Was exceptionally equipped. Really close to the Main Street meant we could walk to breakfast or the supermarket and within 15 minutes of all the wineries. Would definitely recommend staying here."

Luca and Rosanna"
30724902,442178189,2019-04-23,11086535,Nadine,"The farmhouse was just as gorgeous as the pictures. It was great to stay outside of town in the peaceful Light Pass. Very close to major towns, and lots to do in the area. Sibylle left great instructions for making the best use of the house. Vineyards in the backyard are very picturesque! We stayed for two nights, but could easily see ourselves living in the area."
30724902,444343034,2019-04-27,244074717,Andre,"As my first AirBnB experience, Petra's House was a fantastic surprise. Surrounded by vineyards and staying in an original 1910 house was a great way to immerse ourselves in the Barossa state of mind. The house was spotless and we got some belated easter eggs as a welcome. If you like wine, and peace & quiet, this is a great option."
30724902,447522984,2019-05-04,9985887,Kath,This little cottage is very quaint and brought back lots of memories for my husband of his grandma’s house in regional Victoria. It was cold but there were plenty of heaters around the house. The bed was good and the feather doona was adequate overnight. The other facilities - kitchen and bathroom were basic but in keeping with the style of the cottage. It was a good location for our needs and a great stay overall.
30724902,451459227,2019-05-12,8996033,Andrea,We had a great overnight stay in Sibylle's quirky cottage. It was the perfect base for our family of four to explore the Barossa.

30724902,467010892,2019-06-10,131418318,Gary,"️ cosy, eclectic little home
HOWEVER ..

￭ the inadequate Heating ( fan heater FAILED dismally to heat the rooms with 11'6"" ceiling height)
￭ the faulty electrical WIRING.. fuses tripping all the time when using fan Heaters & fuses over-Heating. I got a zap when checking one of the fuses on one occasion.
- fuses are 16Amp so is dangerous to use more than one heater per circuit. This meant that for safety one needed to turn off the 12Amp fan heater if using toaster or jug. It was also dangerous to try to use a fan heater in kitchen & Lounge at the same time (24A LOAD against 16A fuse). The expectation to manipulate appliances to avoid tripping the fuses was LESS than satisfactory. 
This house in its current state is unsatisfactory for RENTAL purposes. Additionally there is INADEQUATE / LACK OF heating or cooling ( not even a ceiling fan).
￭ No thermal bedding even though the booking was was in mid-winter. 
￭ Crockery & Cutlery appeared to have been OpShop leftovers & was NOT up to standard .. some items are chipped (hygiene issue). Only 3 plates so had to eat in shifts.
￭ Cooking utensils are old & need replacing .. hygiene issue
￭ HWS was inadequate for 4 adults
￭ Washing machine was NOT working.
￭ No axe provided to cut firewood to length ... had to resort to brute strength to break it up
￭ No broom/ mop provided in case we needed to clean up ?
￭ Only ONE key provided even though it was clear that 2 couples would be using the house."
30724902,474177288,2019-06-23,21068691,Anne,"A lovely house with period correct finishings, bringing back memories of the golden ages of yesteryears. 

Sibylle was easy to communicate with, check in was easy, and some breakfast food and drinks were provided, which is a very nice touch!

If you do visit in winter however, bring extra thick indoor clothing along as the place is cold; there are only two small heaters."

Nice personal hand written notes about where items are located in the house, how the taps work etc.

Sibylle was easy to communicate with and house was spotless clean and perfect. Thanks again and we will be back"

31177307,440428101,2019-04-20,28020962,Nathan,"I highly recommend a stay at Whiterocks. A beautifully presented classic bungalow in the heart of Tanunda, we loved the accommodation and hung around the house more than we anticipated because it felt so homely.

Kim provided us with some great tips for what to see and do in the area and Tammey made us feel very welcome on arrival.

Will be back and telling all my friends and family to stay at this beautiful home, thanks again.

Nathan"

She has created a beautiful guest quarters in her new home that is stylish and spacious, comfortable,  and convenient to the many wineries and nearby small towns. Located in the countryside, there is peace and birdsong. She provided a wide selection of breakfast items, including eggs and bacon, honey from her hives, and other homemade items to round out a lovely breakfast. After two months traveling, her place ranked in the top three of our many Airbnbs. We highly recommend if you are thinking of visiting the Eden and Barossa Valleys!"
31336642,616166341,2020-03-09,309882201,Leonie,"Homely, clean and comfortable and Evelyn is very friendly and welcoming.
Thoroughly recommended!"
31336642,618226488,2020-03-15,70726235,Leah,"The thought and care put into little touches around the place, like fresh flowers and produce, for example, make this space feel loving and cosy while being super clean, fresh and modern at the same time.

Evelyn asked ahead of time of any dietary requirements so I could happily get stuck in to all the treats provided, knowing my allergy had been considered.

I highly recommend this spot to any couples or singles in need of an escape to take a breath, Meander is perfect."
31336642,624355965,2020-05-10,287056285,Alanah,The place was beautiful! Nice and cosy winter nights with a hot tea was bliss . Beautiful scenery with lots of animals around. Evelyn had out done herself with the homemade products. Nothing better! Loved how she used the space with wooden furniture with touches or green and blue around.
31336642,626282801,2020-05-26,2434750,Barbara,This is the perfect place to relax and enjoy a warm welcome. We used Meander Retreat as a base for walking the Lavender Federation Trail. Perfect retreat after a day's hiking! Evelyn is a fabulous host.
31336642,628415796,2020-06-08,87922674,Stephan,"We could not have imagined a better Winter stay - stunning accommodation, great breakfast, and the most lovely host.

Thank you - best experience we’ve had in a long time."
31336642,632678944,2020-06-27,129056477,Christina,This is a beautiful property and a very stylish studio. It’s the perfect location to explore the Barossa/Hills and get some country air. We highly recommend this stay.
31336642,635281067,2020-07-06,119902528,Paul,"Lovely spot on the edge of the Barossa. Evelyn is a great host, unobtrusive but attentive. Super clean, nice Asian decor touches, really warm in the winter, high ceilings and roomy. Chooks, veges, fruit in season and modern kitchen for own cooking. Lost an hour in the big bath after canoeing and walking around Warren Reservoir."
31336642,642459703,2020-07-26,27871156,Evgeny,We have really enjoyed our stay. We will definitely recommend this place and will be back one day ourselves.
31336642,646104738,2020-08-02,2434750,Barbara,"We had a great time staying at Meander. We love the house and the location. Evelyn is a very thoughtful and generous host. This was our second stay at Meander. We really enjoyed the extra trouble Evelyn went to - bonfire, after dinner drinks, the wood oven pizza. The location is perfect for exploring the Barossa wineries and walking the Lavender Trail. We look forward to another visit in the future."
31336642,649229767,2020-08-10,97431100,Peter,Thanks Evelyn for a wonderful stay at your sparking cleaning retreat.  We enjoyed our stay in the quite Springton fields with the rolling hills and with the Barossa just down the road.   Peter & Prue

Thanks again Evelyn for a wonderful stay x"
31336642,740468652,2021-03-20,166713533,Shannon,"What a peaceful and relaxing spot! We loved every part of our stay from adventuring around the property, being greeted by doggo and chickens, relaxing with a wine under the gums and the amazing facilities. Evelyn is a lovely host who will make sure you’re well looked after but have your own space. She puts so many lovely touches into the property and we really enjoyed making our breakfast with local produce! Easy adventuring into the Barossa by car. Thank you again!"
31364857,410902622,2019-02-10,36250545,Margaret,A beautiful cosy stylish retreat for 2. Enjoyed spa and outdoor  area. Great hosts.
31364857,414514378,2019-02-20,168873428,Maryam,"57 studio was very clean and new, nicely designed and had a great space.
The location was central to Barossa Valley but not walking distance to Tanunda town centre.
We were abit disappointed that we didn’t meet Annemarie during our stay."

Highly recommended!"

31364857,442583764,2019-04-23,135359470,Dominic,"Sparkling clean and beautiful. Better described as an up-market granny flat though, they've made every effort to make it private and have done very well. Just something for people to be aware of :)"
31364857,444344225,2019-04-27,150671842,Mark And Sarah,Beautiful hosts and accommodation with everything you need. Spa was a special treat. Easy walk to main street of Tanunda. Also several wineries withing walking distance. Highly recommended!

31364857,466015967,2019-06-08,63460787,Allan,"The studio was spotlessly clean, well provisioned, modern and with everything working. It was perfect for our needs as a base from which to ride the Barossa Cycling trail. It's tastefully furnished,  comfortable and relaxing, in a quiet location. The wine and chocolate were most appreciated. Thank you, we recommend it very highly and would stay again!"
31364857,470099159,2019-06-16,227867891,Stacay-Ann,"For us this was just a stunning studio in a perfect spot for visiting some local wineries. From the moment we checked in we were greeted and given some tips on local places to eat and drink, the amenities and extra touches exceeded any expectations I could have had, and the studio itself was clean and modern and just perfect for a few nights away. I can't think of anything that could be done better at this spot and I would definitely stay again on another trip to the barossa."
31364857,477767085,2019-06-29,261321309,Emma,This is a great place to stay if you want to explore the wineries of the area. The place was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed our short break here.
31364857,480039917,2019-07-02,166719785,Sacha,Had the a fantastic 2 days away in this perfect little apartment. Had full ambition to go out and enjoy culinary delights of local restaurants and bars for days but felt much more comfortable staying in and in joying the unique atmosphere this little place had to offer !
31364857,482698992,2019-07-06,238641083,Jill,"Sparkling clean studio bedroom with all the amenities of a hotel and lots of little thoughtful touches such as local wine, chocolate, milk. Would definitely stay again."

The host was lovely and took us to some wineries for a far cheaper price than a taxi! Perfect place for a little weekend escape from the city and the location is fantastic to get to all the local wineries. Thank you for a wonderful stay, we will be back :)"
31364857,494186255,2019-07-24,135790670,Ross & Jo,"Lindsay and Annemaree were lovely hosts ! 'Studio 57' offered a cosy and luxurious little hide away to unwind and relax in for a couple of days with all the amenities one could ask for. The wine, chocolate, newspaper and bath robes were just some of the special little touches."
31364857,496818911,2019-07-28,165536063,Jess,"We stayed here as part of a weekend in the Barossa, and it didn’t disappoint! You are sooo close to everywhere you could possibly want to visit. The space is lovely and very very clean! We were just shocked by how close the Airbnb was to the owners house, as it is not part of the description! Overall we had a lovely stay."
31364857,501599152,2019-08-04,86783773,Tracey,"Very Clean and spacious, everything you need and perfectly decorated, areas inside and out to sit and relax, close to the main road if you like walking or a $10 taxi ride to most places"
31364857,504567195,2019-08-08,114712810,Robert,"Unfortunately we couldn’t wait to leave. Lindsay entered the unit on three separate occasions during our stay and only had the courtesy to let us know the once. This made us feel uneasy from the very start of our stay. 
I also cancelled a wine tour with Lindsay and the way he spoke was beyond belief. I’m certainly glad I cancelled in the end. 
On a good note having spent most of our time out of the unit we had a fantastic time in the Barossa."
31364857,507736676,2019-08-12,39319163,Betty,"Stylish, got everything you need. Great place for 2. Lindsay was a great host and made sure we had everything when we settled in.  Got an outdoor BBQ and spa, too bad we didn't get a chance to enjoy either because the weather was just too cold."
31364857,537619200,2019-09-29,157862729,Cj,Studio 57 is extremely clean and quaint. It is very well dressed. The photographs don't do it justice. Very private from the hosts residence and the outdoor area is amazing. The studio had everything we needed. The bed is firmer than I am used to but still extremely comfortable. We were there for my partner's birthday and they even left us a birthday card! A highly recommended bnb! We will be back!
31364857,543025405,2019-10-07,159796505,Alex,Staying at this place was great. It is clean and tidy and well equipped and in a good location. We had a great time and would visit again.
31364857,553355694,2019-10-24,176886515,Geoff,"Murnanes place is a lovely little retreat, spotlessly clean and with some nice touches. We would definitely stay again"
31364857,556974468,2019-10-31,9043001,Karen,"Loved our stay at Studio 57.  The photos really don’t do this place justice.  It was much larger than we were expecting and we loved all of the little extras (robes, wine, chocolate, milk etc).  We would without a doubt stay here again, and have already recommended it to some friends."
31364857,559872389,2019-11-04,140887094,Rohan,Fantastic hosts! Would stay again anytime given the chance. Great space topped off with the host being our chauffeur for our winery tour. Would recommend to anyone looking for accommodation in the Barossa!
31364857,565834734,2019-11-17,58062135,Jennet,"As well as accommodation, Lindsey does personalised tours of the Barossa which we can recommend. You get to go where you want to go at your own pace!"
31364857,568031822,2019-11-23,61957352,Justin,"Great location - close proximity to wineries & town. Clean, comfortable and nice amenities."
31364857,570616998,2019-11-29,20836121,Andy,"What a great experience! This is such a nice place to stay in Barossa valley. The pictures really don't do justice to this very nice appartement. The location is quiet, the town center and some wineries (including Peter Lehmann if you are looking for big one) are in walking distance and the hosts are super nice. Nothing to worry about in this appartement! Super clean, super comfy and it has everything you need incl. a BBQ place, a whirlpool, nice terasse to have breakfast or BBQ outside and general items like a huge fridge, dishes, glases, etc. . We have also booked a wine tour with Lindsay (the host) and it was a blast. My wife and me highly recommend it if you stay here! It is a private tour and you can discuss upfront with Lindsay where to go. We left out the big wineries and went to some small wineries and a brewery, which we would never have found without Lindsay. It is definitely a special wine tour as Lindsay is well-known in the area and has a huge knowledge about it. It gave us a really special feeling as we never felt like normal ""tourists"" going from winery to winery, but more like locals meeting friends and drink some wine...well, we were still tourists :-) , but it was a great experience. Definitely the best stay during our holiday!"

31364857,589397239,2020-01-05,24642062,Nisha,"Studio 57 is a self-sufficient aesthetically-pleasing spot. Had everything we needed. Pictures don’t do justice. Great location, so central for us to get around. Even walking distance if you’d like that too. We were celebrating a birthday and were pleasantly surprised with a bottle of wine and a birthday card upon arrival. Very sweet of Lindsay and Annemaree to go that extra mile. We booked a wine tour with Lindsay as well, he knows the best spots. Pillows are plenty and bed is very comfy, but if you can only sleep on a firm pillow - bring your own. Don’t leave without saying hi to Denzel (the cutest Cavoodle in Tannunda). Forgot our passports behind and Annemaree was kind enough to send them back to us by post. Can’t recommend this place enough!"
31364857,592436614,2020-01-13,74548148,Laurent,"Clean and stylish studio.

31364857,632439933,2020-06-27,346971430,Wayne,"Great location for the Barossa.
Spotlessly clean - could eat off the floor! If you are a clean freak this place won't disappoint.
Lindsay met us on arrival and showed us around his lovely little place.
Our only criticism was that the property is on the same grounds as the hosts - not sure this was mentioned on the site posting. Though the hosts didn't interfere or disturb us at all.
The spa in the back overlooks what is possibly a ""shared"" garden. Lindsay assured us that the blinds on his house which possibly overlooked the rear yard were constantly pulled down during our stay (which they were) but we just didn't feel comfortable having a spa.
That aside a great place to stay"
31364857,637007230,2020-07-11,24525855,Megan,"We absolutely loved our stay at Studio 57! The perfect spot for a romantic getaway. Lindsay was a wonderful host, responding quickly to all communication and meeting us on arrival to show us around. The space is beautifully styled and absolutely spotless. The bed super comfortable, the spa and fireplace a treat. We can't recommend this place highly enough."
31364857,638272269,2020-07-14,26939375,Nadine,"Studio 57 was absolutely perfect for our 2 person getaway. The apartment was sparkling clean, homey and had all the amenities you would need. The hosts also run wine tours which is super convenient, and we had the absolute pleasure of having a private tour with Lindsay organizing it for us. Although we went in middle of winter, when we were at the apartment at night we spent most of our time in the gorgeous outdoor area in the spa, with the heater on and a glass of wine. I would definitely recommend, perfect stay and very helpful and kind hosts. Thankyou!"
31364857,639213232,2020-07-18,329496805,Angela,"Small, but clean and new.  Limited indoor and outdoor space   - note this a studio in the owners backyard."

31364857,644421890,2020-07-31,269978654,Kate,Although this property is in the same yard as the owners you would not be able to tell from inside the studio apartment. It was sparkling clean and they have thought of everything!!! There was a screen in the outdoor patio area which made it feel very secluded and private. The hot tub is to die for. I would definitely stay here again!!
31364857,645480369,2020-08-02,353543176,Detlef,"Awesome Apartment clean, modern and comfortable close to town centre and recommend the wine tour with Lindsay in his luxurious Holden HSV Grange."

A great bed, with pillows to match, waterfall shower. Nice surprises with complimentary snacks provided.

31364857,717776426,2020-12-23,64226495,Ashish,"Me and my wife stayed at studio 57 and had a absolute blast. The studio is a well designed and caters to every need. It also offers a large covered / non covered outdoor area with a jacuzzi and BBQ facilities. This is an ideal place to visit the barossa valley with walkimg distance from wineries, shops and restaurants. A must visit."
31364857,718565232,2020-12-27,88762017,Fernanda,"Extremely pleasant stay. A hidden gem in Barossa. Everything is well thought for you to feel in a 5-star location. The bed is comfortable, the decoration makes you feel at home. The outside jacuzzi is an extra that makes it even more delightful. A well-equipped bbq and a nice backyard may convince you to spend more time at home than visiting the vineyards. Every detail has a lot of care from the hosts. Not to mention the location. Right at the Tanunda’s centre,  which makes your life very convenient. 
Totally recommendable!!"
31364857,719284219,2020-12-29,21068023,Amy,"We had such a great time during our stay.

31364857,726947384,2021-01-26,32397696,Lucy,"The studio apartment is on the same block as the main house and although we did see Lindsay around, it is very private. It shares a driveway with the main house. The studio was very clean and tidy and they gifted us a bottle of wine for our stay which was a nice touch. The outdoor/spa area is shared with the main house although there is a privacy blind that can be pulled down. The house is also very close to the Main Street of Barossa and some wineries. Would recommend staying here!"
31364857,727389447,2021-01-29,68042580,Julia,"Beautiful accomodation in the perfect location . Short walk to town centre and a few key wineries. We really enjoyed the little touches that made our stay extra comfortable - tea, coffee, even milk and fresh bread. Highly recommend !"
31364857,730435181,2021-02-11,115542497,Taya,"What a terrific little gem to explore the Barossa from. Studio 57 was decked out with all the amenities that you would need for a memorable stay. 
I loved the private garden space, setup with a TV and tub, which was perfect to while the hours away with a bottle of red wine. 
Don't forget to try the restaurant '1918' whilst you are in town, serving up the best food & wine in their gorgeous garden area. 
The hosts were great, check-in was easy and hassle free. However note the studio is close the to the owners adjoining property, in case anyone was seeking pure privacy. 
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend. It was a wonderful spot! 5 stars."

Alan & Sue, the hosts had provided lots of small touches and local flavors for us to use. This increased the value of staying with them. The cottage was spotless and provided a wonderful mix between city and rural amenities. I can highly recommend your stay with Alan & Sue."

All rooms are large, spotless, and beautifully appointed.  Sue and Alan also lit the fire for us before we arrived, and had supplied local wine, cheese and crackers as a welcome.   We had a wonderful stay, and look forward to returning.    One tip for future guests:  when you check out, the pet wether and ram will be looking for their treat of fruit or vegetable.   Have something with you!   I did not, and had to forage for clover and grass before we left.  Great fun!"

Sue met us on arrival with apple to feed them much to his delight! The bedrooms all have comfy beds with stylish and warm bedding. The living room is cozy with plenty of seating and a combustion stove which was lit for our arrival. A very welcoming sight on a cold August day! The bathroom is renovated and the kitchen well-stocked with delicious local bacon and eggs for breakfast. There is no heating at that end of the house so bring your ugg-boots if coming in winter! Thanks again Sue and Alan. We loved our stay!"

The property is beautiful for anybody whom loves nature and the outdoors, go for a wonder during the early morning to catch some kangaroos jumping around, watch beautiful birds taking baths as you sip your evening wine at the outdoor patio, and please don't miss the local boutique wineries (especially Ballycroft - beautiful full bodied wines) whilst you're there.

A shame the communication wasnt great beforehand. No replies on Airbnb. No emails. (Even though we had confirmed our contact details) Had to call the owner to get more info. I'd definitely recommend installing a lock box or safe for easy access to the property. Key was an extra 15 minute drive to pick up and drop off. Other than this a nice place with lots wildlife and character! Thanks!

32789383,661375370,2020-09-07,54277464,Fiona,"Great private property for kids to explore - we spotted birds, lizards, a koala and lots of kangaroos!"

32789383,727230097,2021-01-27,87033384,Liron,"Our stay here brought us everything we wanted.. to get away from it all and enjoy some of Australia’s land uninterrupted. The house was perfectly suited to the environment. The little things we appreciated like the music provided, nice bathrooms and large spaces. Drinking wine and sitting under the vines was a bit of magic. Such a nice part of our holiday. We won’t forget staying at wings."
32789383,727788375,2021-01-30,169611420,Luke,The place was in a secluded area on a huge property with lots of wildlife. The key pickup was 13km out of the way each way and was a hassle. A keylocker would make this experience so much better.
32789383,737422282,2021-03-07,51859311,Elena,Graeme’s place is exceptional - very secluded with a lot of opportunities to see wildlife and enjoy silence and serenity of nature.

So much space for parking extra vehicles and all the ammenities were top quality. The house was immaculate and the finishing touches were impressive. We were very impressed as a whole with this house. 

Thanks kindly Kathy"
32820248,441446399,2019-04-22,124169293,Joanna,"Kathy's place is amazing. The photos don't do the house justice. There is so much space for everyone to relax and spread out if needed, but the big dining room and super comfortable lounge made it a great space to spend time with friends. We were able to walk to the Brewery which was a nice bonus. The amenities were all there, very modern kitchen and bathrooms and we had towels, soap, wine glasses, everything you could want on a getaway to the Barossa. Can't wait to return!"
32820248,462161186,2019-06-02,173766643,Rebecca,The place was very clean and only short walk from breweries and restaurants. We had 7 adults and 2 children and fit very comfortably. We will be back!
32820248,482050130,2019-07-06,14736799,Michael,"We planned a trip with 4 couples and based ourselves out of Kathy's house for two nights. When we weren't out exploring the Barossa we chose to stay in and relax at the house due to the great facilities on offer. The house was perfect to enjoy each others company - a bar, great cooking amenities, beautiful dining area, and a cosy fireplace. We had a blast and would thoroughly recommend to others. Great for larger groups. Would stay again."

Peter and Kathy provided everything you can think of. 
Easy check in.
The lounges were very comfortable with massive TVs with Netflix. 
The kitchen was well and truely stocked with the essentials to cook your own big meals or a bbq! 
They provided some snacks and a bottle of wine on arrival which was a thoughtful and sweet touch. 
The beds were very comfortable and had plenty of spare pillows and blankets if needed. 
The bathrooms were very clean and modern. 
Location wise very close to the main strip in Tanunda just a couple of minutes drive. 
Close drive to a lot of the famous wineries in Barossa. Definitely recommend staying at the BV house and will be returning for future vacations!"

Kathy was great with communication. Good arrival procedure, fair house rules, instructions provided for appliances and available if needed.

We found the location to be good.  Just on the edge of town but that suited us so we could park in town and walk the streets or bypass it when heading out if we wanted. You could easily take a pleasant walk in also."
32820248,542998617,2019-10-07,25823834,Leah,Our family loved our stay here over the long weekend. Great layout and nicely child friendly for our 16 month old.
32820248,554784573,2019-10-27,232753143,Raghu,"Many thanks to Kathy  and Peter for offering us this outstanding property. 
We were three families with 6 children ranging from 4-7 yrs. This  home  accommodated all of us comfortably. There are many high quality finishing touches to mention. 
Starting from comfortable beds, great quality sheets, extremely comfortable  luxury towels and amenities.
The  two living areas  with luxury comfortable sofas allowed us to relax and unwind in one area while the kids watched Tv in another section. 
The bathrooms are sparkling clean and relaxing. 
The kitchen is amazing , well  equipped and organised with high quality  appliances. 
We could live here for a month and would not feel home sick. 
The back yard was perfect for the kids with plenty of space. There is a bar  area too if adults want to stay at home and relax. 
Location was handy to everything in Barossa and our group had a memorable stay. 
This property sets a high standard for what an Airbnb property should be. 
Finally wonderful and easy communication with Kathy that ensured that we had a very smooth holiday  experience. 
We would like to congratulate kathy and Peter on such a well maintained home and would very much like to return back in the coming months."

This is a large house and a washing machine and place to dry clothes would have been the icing on the cake. There was an issue with the Aircon which Fiona sorted immediately and effectively. Many thanks indeed.

The check in process with Fiona was seamless and we were greeted with a lovely platter of local cheeses and charcuterie waiting for us on our arrival. This is an ideal base for a family group or some couples.  The rooms are spacious and cool (we were there in summer and hardly needed to use the A/C in each room).

33301704,737444464,2021-03-08,995786,David,Really enjoyed our stay. House is just beautiful. Walking distance to main street restaurants and pubs. My 80 yr old mum had a ball playing the piano!
33539267,441416242,2019-04-22,49970840,Jordan,"Our stay in the chapel was nothing but a 10/10 experience. 
Fresh, clean and indulgent feel of a 5 star hotel with the added element of  all the comforts and condiments ( literally eggs, bacon, milk, tomatoes, bread, butter, jam, olives, wine) of home. It truly is everything you hoped it to be.

Jonathan was an extremely understanding and helpful host who let us be, and offered a hand when needed.  He went above and beyond, so thankyou for letting us stay at your place in lovely Lyndoch. We’ll be back."

It was a little bit cold so had to keep the aircon going full time when fire not in play! Thanks Jonathan for a warm welcome and great communication and, of course, an enjoyable wine tasting day out."

33539267,580609561,2019-12-22,48867344,Team,Beautiful property for easy access to Barossa wineries. Stylish and spacious with thoughtful touches. The Wi-fi was down when we visited but Jonathan was very apologetic about it and said it was being resolved.
33539267,586519476,2020-01-01,12476436,Alan,"The Chapel is a really cute and unique property, well stocked and very comfortable, in an excellent location for exploring the Barossa. We enjoyed our NYE holiday with friends in the house. 

There were a few minor maintenance issues (which were noted by the owners on arrival) and it would have been great to have some curtains upstairs as the sun comes in very early this time of year, but otherwise we enjoyed the house. Definitely note that both bedrooms are open with very little privacy which may be an issue for anyone concerned about that."
33539267,595350617,2020-01-20,50031394,Rachel,"Great spot for a very relaxing few days. We took up Jonathan’s offer of a private tour of the Barossa and Eden valleys, and we had a wonderfully pampered and informative day. Perfect long week getaway."

33539267,628419064,2020-06-08,128209074,Milly,"Photos do not do this place justice! We booked in for a relaxing weekend away, and were absolutely blown away when we arrived. The bath tub is worth mentioning - its more like a swimming pool and was the highlight of our stay. The styling and renovations to the old chapel are stunning and complimentary to its heritage. Hosts provided great advice on wineries to visit. I've had many friends contact us and ask where we stayed and have happily referred them on!"
33539267,629392211,2020-06-14,225672443,Kia,Jonathon and Kate have created a wonderfully romantic space and a a treasure for the Barossa.

33539267,632157594,2020-06-26,22652840,Karen,"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful cottage. Stayed here 20 years ago for our wedding night and the new renovations have only added to the place, whilst still keeping the character. Everything you need is supplied and lots of little touches to make it a warm comfortable place to relax and unwind. The addition of the spa bath was perfect and with added touches of candles made it very romantic. A glass of Shiraz in front of the fire certainly didn’t hurt, either! Fantastic place to base yourselves from which to explore the region and would definitely recommend."
33539267,632679252,2020-06-27,347962135,Jessica,"Beautiful location in a fantastic little town, close to supermarket and cafe/bakery. Stunning views and walking distance to wineries.

As other reviewers have mentioned, the pictures don't quite do it justice; when we arrived we were just blown away by this amazing space. Very cosy and comfortable, and has everything you could need. The spa bath is AMAZING, so relaxing.

The Chapel is a beautiful and tasteful conversion. Very warm in the middle of winter, good amenities and the outstanding bath must be mentioned.

33539267,669469108,2020-09-30,77607793,Paul,"If you’re looking for somewhere to stay in the Barossa, then this is the perfect place!! We had an amazing stay at the chapel. It is well located and close to several excellent wineries and food options. The chapel itself has so much character and a nice touch of luxury. You could easily sleep 4 adults in the chapel quite comfortably with the two separate sleeping areas. We couldn’t  recommend staying here more!"
33539267,670018656,2020-10-01,143276610,Karlee,The Chapel is absolutely amazing. Me and my partner had the best time. The hosts are beyond helpful and the space is beautiful.

33539267,701958643,2020-10-19,48818926,Hanna,We arrived after dark and found a beautifully lit cottage that was a delight from the outside. The interior was no less disappointing. It was warm and welcoming. The interior tastefully decorated. The owners have gone to extra time and effort to supply all the comforts of home. We loved our stay and would highly recommend it. Hopefully we will be able to come back one day.
33539267,702435039,2020-10-21,66680841,Rachael,"The Chapel provided the most relaxing and indulgent holiday ever.

Accomodation so peaceful & relaxing. Everything you need. Their hair dryer saved my life. All the things you need for extended stay. Will definitely book again if we need accomodation in the area."

33539267,706810652,2020-11-05,31501396,Alison,This is a cute and well appointed cottage. I'd give it a 5 star rating except that the gap between the walls and roof in the stunning main bathroom allowed dirt and insects in. Otherwise beautiful.
33539267,713175729,2020-12-03,16399411,Johan,"Jonathan and Kate were lovely hosts. The spa bath in the middle of the open space was the best! There were many small touches such as the robes, towels and milk, tea/coffee and breakfast items. Although it was just the two of us for a romantic weekend, there’s enough space for two couples with the upstairs section. The location is good with a few hotels and cafes around the corner, and the Barossa wineries starting just there. Would love to stay again!"
33539267,715460451,2020-12-14,345431238,Kayla,"My wife and I were blown away by the beauty of the chapel. It was truly stunning to stay in such a beautiful and well redesigned heritage building. The finishes such as the staircase and bathroom really added to the positive experience. A point of growth for the hosts would be to work on cleanliness between guests such as vacuuming thoroughly, checking all the dishes are cleaned properly and cleaning dirt off the bath robes. Outside of cleanliness, we would recommend this stellar stay"

Coming to the Barossa for the first time, Jonathan and Kate had lots of great local suggestions available and the Chapel had generous amenities. Highly, highly recommend!!"
33539267,721804432,2021-01-03,140285536,Laura,It's a cool place. Jonathan and Kate were very kind to let us check out late as it was the morning after our wedding. The kitchen door did not lock though which was not good.
33539267,722467347,2021-01-07,8404428,Bård,Very unique stay in beautiful old Chapel. Lovely bathroom with big bath. Jonathan took us on a wine tour which was also a great experience. Highly recommend.
33539267,723150890,2021-01-09,362093873,Laura,Booked this airbnb for my parents as a birthday gift to my mother. They both absolutely loved the place and came back with raving reviews! They showed me around through facetime and it looked absolutely gorgeous
33539267,726088774,2021-01-23,74946908,Branden,Outstanding accommodation. Walking distance to the local township and a great base to the entrance of the Barossa. The bathroom area is glorious and a great place to relax after cycling the gorgeous Barossa Bike Trail.

33539267,727232754,2021-01-28,126981258,Alison,We couldn’t have been happier with our stay at The Chapel. The accommodation was even more stylish than the photos suggested and the hosts saw to every little detail (including a welcoming decanter of port on the coffee table). I would thoroughly recommend the beautiful Chapel to any friends or family travelling to Barossa! Thanks again Jonathan and Kate.
33539267,728938732,2021-02-05,220851238,Patrick,The Chapel was amazing! Great distance from most wineries and a very homely and comforting place! Would definitely recommend!
33539267,729790697,2021-02-08,94216946,Cohen,"My girlfriend and I both booked a stay at The Chapel and were blown away. The photos do not do this place justice.  

If you’re looking for an affordable stay that is close to all the wineries in the region, is visually stunning and has fantastic hosts this is the place to book. 

John gave both of us plenty of tips for the area for places to both eat and see. John also has his own wine tour business and this was certainly the highlight of our trip. The tour picked us up from the chapel and was tailored to places we were interested in. I was not a big wine drinker but I sure am now. 

If you want to experience the full taste of the Barossa this air Bnb and wine tour is a must."
33539267,730428291,2021-02-11,105817865,Arthur,"If you’re traveling to the Barossa this is the place to stay. So get in early, don’t miss out."

33885699,447649804,2019-05-04,6518238,Jim,"Tracy's place is in a terrific and quiet location right behind the main street of Tanunda. Short walk to local cafes and local cellar doors. The design is modern and spacious and in particular, the beds were very comfortable and afforded a really good night's sleep. We are 2 professional couples that arrived 4 hours before the 3pm check-in and Tracy allowed us to have access to the place immediately.  Overall I'd recommend it highly and we look forward to staying in the apartment the next time we visit the Barossa.
Regards,
Jim Dimas"

Our hosts Tracy and Jaysen absolutely nailed this place with providing very thoughtful amenities and a continental organic breakfast which was a treat! This apartment has been purpose equipped as guest accommodation and the warm but stylish design and decor in the open plan living area was exceptionally welcoming. The beds are extremely comfortable and the property is well situated just a few moments stroll to the main street in Tanunda, centrally located in the Barossa Valley! Truly the best way to experience the delights of the Barossa.

I can't say enough good things about this place, the owners have done an amazing job from top to bottom. No detail has been overlooked. It is a testament to the fact that you can have a beautiful place in a beautiful location and still set yourself miles apart with an amazing space and wonderful thoughtful touches. Form the moment we arrived, we were made to feel like we were in luxury yet always felt at home and comfortable."

the house is just behind the main street, food & bar is just 300-1km away.
i assume this is a new refurbish house, most of the item are new.
specious high ceiling, stylish white modern design.
the host welcomed us with some fresh eggs, jam, butter, milk & bread.
hotel standard bedding & linen.
L shape sofa is just an additional chill place for gadget.
outdoor is too cold for us to enjoy but it is a nice place to relax, with additional 2 big cat come as guest.
enjoy staying this place.

33885699,530560154,2019-09-16,63006800,Elizabeth,Tracey's place is a stunning gem in the barossa. She is so helpful and gives you many tips and advice for the area. The accommodation is stunning and comfortable with all the amenities you need. We loved our stay here and only wished it was longer.
33885699,532511102,2019-09-20,15328664,Doug,"Tracy’s stylish and nicely decorated town house in the heart of Tanunda was a wonderful place to stay to explore all that the Barossa has to offer.  The open plan living room and modern kitchen downstairs and two upstairs bedrooms were all very comfortable and clean. Tracy’s added touch of hospitality included providing freshly baked bread, free range eggs and milk for breakfast as well as giving us her suggestions for the best places to eat and visit. Highly recommend Tracy’s place for an enjoyable stay."

33885699,542959702,2019-10-06,88241458,Diane,"A beautifully, tastefully decorated place in a superb village location. We stayed here with another couple for a wedding and it was perfect. Tracy added lots of little extras which were very much appreciated ie fresh bread, butter, jam, selection of tea and milk. 
I wish there had been a mirror in the bedrooms - it was a rush getting our faces on sharing the one bathroom mirror.  Other than that the property has everything you would need."

The apartment was so well located only 1 minutes walk from the main street, very clean,  beautifully lit by natural light, tastefully appointed and lacked for nothing.  We particularly appreciated the little touches upon our arrival such as the bread, milk, butter, and coffee provisions.  First impressions are everything and we were really impressed.  I would recommend your place to anyone who wants to be in the heart of it."

We would highly recommend this accommodation. Thank you Tracy for being a great host."

33885699,567191476,2019-11-21,154434762,Ben,A lovely place in the middle of town with a short driving distance to wineries in the area.

It appears to be a fresh, recently renovated unit with new appliances and furnishings. Every room, including the all-important bedrooms and bathroom, was sparkling clean throughout. Bedding and towels were hotel-quality clean. A lot of the bathroom and kitchen products stood out as eco-friendly. AppleTV was appreciated for the extra entertainment options. Location is perfect, being one street back from Murray St which is the heart of Tanunda with great food and drink options a short walk away. Could not fault the unit at all. Tracy the host has done an amazingly thorough job to make a very comfortable, homely experience. I highly recommend this place and we'd definitely stay here again!"

The location was perfect; it was clean, tidy and stylish; and the little extra touches were so thoughtful and appreciated! From the milk, bread, cereal, eggs and coffee machine that were provided, to the little shampoo and conditioners in the shower, to the house being wonderfully cool on arrival on a hot 40+ degree day, we couldn't fault our stay! We would recommend highly, and would love to come back and stay. The only negative was that we only had 2 nights here! Would've loved to have longer. Thanks so much Tracy!!"
33885699,585582144,2019-12-31,107220077,Ros,"A big thank you to Tracey for providing such a clean and well appointed apartment for our stay in the Barossa. It was great to walk into the apartment to find the air conditioning on as it was a day of 43 degrees, much appreciated. We will definitely recommend Boseka to our friends. Have a fabulous 2020."
33885699,592429986,2020-01-12,165033137,Jennifer,"What is advertised is what you get .
A fresh clean and inviting place. As soon as you enter the apartment your eyes are drawn to open space with lots of natural light and a homely feel .
Tracy’s special touches of lovely decor and organic teas etc are only just a few of the treats you will be very delighted to see . 
Included is high quality linen with great comfort upstairs in the bedrooms and even though the bathroom is very small everything is exceptionally clean and modern . 
With only a short walk to the Main Street ,this little gem “Boseka” in Tanunda in the Barossa is in a great spot."

33885699,603981452,2020-02-10,14209714,Liam,The place was lovely and clean and rather spacious. The bed was incredibly comfortable and the high quality linen made it a hotel style experience. The extra inclusions of high quality local produce and stylish kitchen made it easy to stay in at times to cook and eat. The extra considerations toward organic and green products through out the place added to the well thought out hospitality this host provided. Easy walking distance to local places but the off street parking is reassuring towards the want to hire a car to really experience the wonderful places to visit in nearby areas. Perfect place to stay for a food and wine lover.
33885699,607855320,2020-02-19,213024176,Patricia,"Beautiful sparkling clean, modern apartment right behind the Main Street in Tanunda and close to all amenities. There is a great information centre nearby so we booked a winery tour from our front door. Brilliant place."

33885699,620979507,2020-03-26,46678324,Ina,"We were so well looked after even before arriving. In light of the COVID19 stress, Tracy went out of her way to not only keep the place clean and safe for us but also ensured we had food available and a clear list of where we could buy food to take home. Since we love the outdoors she also provided us with detailed descriptions of her favourite walks so we were well set up. On arrival the house was sparklingly clean and tastefully decorated. It was just as nice not going out in the evening when the place is so nice. We will be back!"

It was spotlessly clean and very cozy. We appreciated the high quality decor, linens and towels and the extra little touches that made it so welcoming. We were delighted with some lovely provisions of fresh bread, milk, eggs and organic tea and coffee that were left for us. 
The location is perfect for walking around the town to enjoy the scenery, visit the shops or enjoy a meal or drink.

You are one street back from the main street of Tanunda with lots of great cafes, dinner spots and boutique shops all within walking distance. The apartment exceeded expectations - it is tastefully decorated, cosy and has everything you need to feel at home from a capsule coffee machine, to smart tv, washing machine, air con etc. Tracy also has a very helpful list of recommendations which we frequently consulted. Will definitely stay again next time we're in the Barossa"

33885699,705238554,2020-10-31,336782911,Tahlia,"Our stay at the Loft was absolutely perfect. It was the perfect space for my Bridesmaids and I to get ready for the Wedding, and the perfect space for photo's - with such beautiful styling, fantastic natural light - and stunning features such as the windows, stairs and big circular mirror. 

Everything we could need was exactly where we would need it, and there was so many thoughtful touches such as the 'Thank you' soap products, local suggestions for food/experiences, coffee pods, eggs, olive oil, bread, milk and above bed lighting to name a few. 

We will definitely back, as it was such a special, relaxing space - we could not recommend it more."

The king bed was the comfiest of our trip since being in SA we slept great!! It was very well set up as an air bnb providing everything you need including basic but delicious local breakfast provisions. It is a very easy walk into tanunda township centre.

The house was absolutely beautiful, including a lovely pool that we enjoyed with our kids every day, and we also fell in love with town of Greenock. Janine thought of every little touch to make our stay special, including holiday decorations, incredible amenities, and delicious treats to enjoy during our stay. We explored local wineries, restaurants and breweries by foot and spent a few days exploring the Barossa Valley, Adelaide Hills and Adelaide by car. Our stay at The Clyde was the highlight of our trip and we will be back!!"
33968239,604625119,2020-02-12,17903140,Michael,A stylish and comfortable house ideally situated for exploring the Barossa and Clare Valleys. The hosts have taken a great deal of trouble in providing quality furnishings and equipment and have also been unusually generous in stocking it with provisions. The air-conditioning coped well with widely varying temperatures during our month long stay whilst the large TV screen with Netflix was a pleasant bonus. The only slight negative might be that light sleepers could find intrusive the noise from the surprisingly busy road in front of the house particularly in the master bedroom. However we would certainly hope to return to this house when making future trips to the region.
33968239,715971560,2020-12-17,25770228,Alistair,"The Clyde made our stay in Barossa Valley absolutely perfect.

34291502,485440942,2019-07-11,6795454,Guangfu,We absolutely love our stay at Achala’s place. Our experience of the SA farm is amazing. Definitely will return to this place in the future.
34291502,525463972,2019-09-08,268135422,Jodie,Achala and her family made us feel very welcome in their home. We were free to treat their home as our own. I found the kitchen easy to cook in. My kids loved the big smart TV and absolutely adored Achala’s gorgeous little girl. I think the highlight of their stay there was playing with her.
34661591,458246224,2019-05-25,261883132,Jaidan,"Josie and Andrews place was a very comfortable stay. Everything we needed was provided, and it was super cozy and warm. They supplied cheese and crackers and food for breakfast, which was such a nice little touch. I would highly recommend staying at their place!"
34661591,464561129,2019-06-06,94090123,Belinda,"Thoroughly enjoyed our stay here whilst visiting the Barossa! Josie and Andrew were wonderful hosts and went out of their way to help with food/winery suggestions and anything we needed. The cottage is newly revamped, super clean and has everything you will need, oh and some little extras to make it feel more like home. Beautiful outlook to vineyard at both front and back and even a cellar door to visit on the neighbouring property. Would highly recommend!"
34661591,465525628,2019-06-08,28285079,Dee,"We loved the location just out of town but near everything at the same time. Very comfortable Airbnb, we chose to stay in at night after winery lunches out. 
Beautiful Barossa sunsets from the front porch with a few wines, and lovely starry nights, hard to beat. Nice breakfasts, comfortable bed and all you need for a relaxing leisurely stay. 
Thanks Josie and Andrew."
34661591,474119619,2019-06-22,32021593,Claudia,"Josie and Andrew’s place was beautiful and set amongst the vines as described. Perfect for a weekend away, and in close proximity to everywhere you’d want to visit whilst in the Barossa. Would definitely recommend."
34661591,479446515,2019-07-01,17231312,Tom,This is an amazing guest house. It is private and has a wonderfully stocked fridge. Josie and Andrew have done a great job renovating the property and everything is sparkling clean. The location (within the vines) is perfect for a weekend or mid week getaway to explore the Barossa Valley. We highly recommend this property.
34661591,482715456,2019-07-07,114145061,Sam,"Josie & Andrew’s place is simply perfect. My girlfriend and I stayed here for a couple nights and we absolutely loved it. The cottage itself was extremely clean and felt brand new, kitchen and bathroom were full of all the amenities you could possibly need, bedroom was really comfortable and even had an electric blanket. The biggest stand out for us was the location, the cottage is located right in the middle of a vineyard so you literally look out the window onto the vines themselves. The hosts recommended we check out Tomfoolery winery which is the vineyard next door, and we were very glad we did because the wine tasting was amazing and it is only a minute walk from your front door! Everything else is within a short drive so we were never in the car for too long. Josie and Andrew could not have been more welcoming hosts. They were accommodating with our check in/out time and were very knowledgeable of all things Barossa and gave us some great tips. Truly lovely people and I hope we will cross paths in the future. Highly recommend staying here!

Sam & Emily"
34661591,487237446,2019-07-14,192434044,Sammy,Great people and a beautiful place to stay. Amazing view over the vine yards and very central to all the attractions of the Barossa. Highly recommend

The cottage was way more equipped than we expected, we could have rocked up with nothing and still had everything we needed! All the products they have stocked are either local or organic. Great local knowledge of events and places to visit, would highly recommend!"
34661591,517900896,2019-08-26,41127492,Andrew,"We'd happily encourage anyone to stay here if you're in the area. Josie & Andrew are great friendly hosts and the property is outstanding. The amount of little extra touches (and some amazing local produce) included make this feel more home than home stay. Great location close to the best the Barossa has to offer. A little out of town, so it's beautifully quiet among the vines, but only a couple of minutes to Nuriootpa."
34661591,521413801,2019-09-01,99463736,Nicolas,Wonderful romantic getaway cottage for anyone looking to relax or indulge in the heart of the Barossa. Close to everything you need and the most welcoming and helpful hosts. Would recommend to anyone

Josie and Andrew thought of everything at their listing, and it’s those little touches that made their place great. As a nurse, I loved the addition of a first aid kit in the bathroom.

Be sure to ask them about winery options as they are great for local tips, and the winery next door gives you 10 per cent off purchases of you mention them. Fantastic!"
34661591,533042861,2019-09-21,21351141,Sally,"Stayed for two nights, it was a great space with lots of homely touches.

34661591,539716114,2019-10-02,85702647,Ben,"Josie and Andrew were fabulous hosts. Their knowledge of the Barossa helped us make the most of our two days there. Josie went above and beyond to make sure we had a refrigerator stocked with vegan goodies, and the cottage was spotless (probably the cleaner Airbnb I’ve ever stayed in). Location was perfect for exploring the region - you can hit tons of wineries within 15 minutes. The kitchen is fully equipped for cooking. Great shower and spacious bathroom."

The guest cottage is located between vineyards, in a quiet and peaceful location in the heart of Barrosa Valley. Newly renovated with everything you need for a relaxing weekend. Josie and Andrew supplied local produce for breakfast (eggs, bread, milk & bacon -yummm!) That was such a lovely touch! 

Bed was comfy & views were amazing! Josie &Andrew gave us tips about local restaurants and family run vineyards.  Overall we had amazing long weekend  & We will definitelybe back!

It was most relaxing in beautiful surroundings. 
Light Pass is a lovely part of the Barossa, still close to all the towns and wineries. Lovely to look out over the vines and see the wildlife. 
Amenities were great and we were overwhelmed how well stocked the fridge was when we arrived. Local tourist tips were spot on.
We hope to return again"
34661591,590551434,2020-01-08,65572801,Michelle,"I cannot recommend Josie and Andrews place enough, one of my new favourite places in the world. Their hospitality is exceptional but not intrusive, they have great local knowledge and make the effort to understand what your interests are before making recommendations, all of which were spot on. 
The cottage is a home away from home, great cooking facilities and has a few lovely spots to enjoy a glass of wine. 
Little touches such as complementary breakfast options and delicious coffee were the cherry on the cake."

34661591,598337004,2020-01-26,17776570,Philippa,"Perfection - it's the only word to describe this experience. If you are visiting the Barossa and this place is free, don't hesitate - just book it! Outstanding hospitality from very thoughtful hosts, extremely comfortable and well-appointed accommodation where everything has been thought of, sparkling clean, and as for the location - you can walk to a winery *next door* to get a bottle or two. Spectacular sunsets, waking with birdsong every morning, a hammock for two....Josie and Andrew have thought of everything, and it shows. If we ever return to the Barossa, we wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. Thank you again for a wonderful relaxing time and for all the generous extras and helpful tips throughout our stay."
34661591,604360302,2020-02-11,54662990,Peter,"In the Vines has to be our best Airbnb experience to date. Jocelyn and Andrew have worked hard to ensure that the cottage provides an exceptional guest accommodation. The fit out and furnishings are of the highest quality and all done with thought and taste. The shower room is just amazing, perfect to wake you up or soothe you after a day in the hot Barossa sun. The hosts provide helpful local insights and tips to enable you to get the best out of your visit. Andrew has good taste in wineries, eateries and coffee shops! Watching the sunset in the evening form the verandah or double hammock is a highlight. I recommenda visit to the Tom Foolery tasting room just a few mins walk away. Enjoy!"

Josie & Andrew are lovely and met us on arrival to let us in and give some tips on things to do and see. Also had plenty of maps, and details about good restaurants and cellar doors. Tomfoolery cellar door is walking distance away, directly next door and well worth a visit."
34661591,633473111,2020-06-30,141020471,Mark,"Josie and Andrew were very friendly and welcoming on our arrival. We were offered a tour of the accommodation and offered one of their very own bottles of red wine which was of high quality. 
The accommodation was exemplary in terms of cleanliness. The fridge stocked with sufficient breakfast provisions including fresh bread, pod coffee and tea. The kitchen and bathroom modern and fresh. Little finishes such as maps of bush walks,  wineries  and local food options were highly helpful. 
The surroundings are magnificent. Nestled within acres of vines with great views from the lounge and kitchen. You have the feeling of being secluded yet close to many top quality wineries. Tomfoolery next door within a 2 minute walk is worth a visit. 
Our privacy and space was maintained throughout our 3 night stay. 
We recommend for couples looking to escape the city. Thanks again Josie and Andrew for your hospitality"

The bed and linens were superb quality. 

Only 5 min walk to the main road in town. Location was quiet. 

With all of the uncertainty right now around travel restrictions, Jerry was prompt with his responses to my questions and provided us with a platter and Prosecco on arrival which was well received and thoughtful.

I’ve now stayed in quite a few Air BnBs, This has to be up there for my favourite. I would without any hesitation recommend Jerry and his place to anyone."

34914043,471660255,2019-06-18,105650440,Damian,"What an incredible place to stay! A working farm still home to the 7th Generation of the family. 

The JHA stone cellar was an ultimate escape for us with all the luxuries and mod cons you could think of, full off hidden surprises to make us feel welcome.

A truly stunning renovation and extension that must be experienced to understand. 
Don’t change a thing at this property, it is perfect! From the old stone wall cellar room to the modern extension, underfloor heating and hot outdoor showers!

We are already planning our trip back at the end of the year!!!"
34914043,700504283,2020-10-15,49892351,Robin,"Staying at the JHÃ Stone Cellar is a truly special experience. What an amazing building formed from the restoration of an old stone barn melded with a modern addition to create something architecturally unique and spectacular. It sits on a rise and offers 270degree views over the peaceful rolling landscape. The house is so well appointed with thoughtful and luxurious fittings and stylishly decorated. The cooking facilities are a cooks delight and the opportunity to cook with an AGA oven and cooktop was something quite special. Our host, Jan, greeted us and gave us a quick but comprehensive orientation to the house and the region. Her recommendations were spot on. Don’t leave without taking the opportunity to have a tasting of The Hutton Vale Farm wines with John. There is a 10 minute drive into Angaston where you can get some Hutton Vale Farm lamb from the local butcher to cook at the house in the AGA or on the Weber Q. While you may just choose to stay in and enjoy the property and facilities, relaxing listening to vinyls on the record player, sipping local wines or g and t’s and taking in the views, it’s also an easy drive to see many of the highlights of the Barossa. I personally can’t wait to return for another stay at this property. Thank you Jan, John and Caitlin for providing such a beautiful space."

Great location for travel and exploration of the surrounding Barossa valley and to come home to at night to rest the weary legs. The house was sparkling clean. The beds were very comfortable.

I have rated 5 starts for cleanliness as the house was spotless.  Only negative was that the BBQ was dirty so didn't get used.  Jasmine was extremely apologetic when I messaged her and has said she will keep a closer eye on the cleaning.   Main living area is large open plan.  Bedrooms are generous sizes.  Was a perfect place for our big family gathering.  Would stay there again as a large group.

35617858,738774527,2021-03-14,19839101,Amy,"Beautiful house in a perfect Location. For ten of us very comfortably. Plenty of spaces for people to gather and also lots of little retreats for privacy. Gorgeous Barossa views and adorable farm animals to feed. 

If I had one small gripe, it would be the mattresses. They’re like concrete. But to be fair, after a long day of wine touring, you barely even notice.

Thanks for a great stay!!"
35660705,473541239,2019-06-21,75599769,Jo,"From the start, our stay couldn't have been more relaxing and enjoyable. The property was beautifully landscaped and on arrival, we were met by Chris who showed us around the farm and introduced the alpacas! The grounds were stunning, from the nearby rolling fields where we spotted a few late night kangaroos from the kitchen window to the paddocks further down the track, there was lots of space to explore should we wish too and an abundance of wildlife. The stars at night were some of the brightest I have seen and the Airbnb had its own, private entrance and truly felt like our very own tranquil escape. 

The log fire and cosy living room were dreamy, immaculately clean and with a homely feel. The bed was comfy, lovely linen sheets and despite the winter, the house never felt cold. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an escape that is still a stone's throw from the Barossa. Plenty of nearby places to eat (a short drive) and caring, respectful hosts, who have put a great effort into the finishing touches. A gem in SA!"
35660705,474120117,2019-06-22,268912292,Ceri,"This has to be the best air bnb I think I have ever stayed in! The setting was absolutely perfect, peaceful, homely and the hosts were amazing! They went above and beyond to ensure our stay was perfect but also left us to just enjoy the surroundings! A complementary bottle of wine whilst putting your feet up infront of the fire was the exact break anyone needs! Getting to meet and feed the alpacas was such a great experience and the hosts are so informative! 
We absolutely loved our stay and will be back!"
35660705,478340290,2019-06-29,70460686,Diana,"OMG Tracey and Chris have been amazing and we highly recommend it for anyone looking for a country stay. 

Property - Gorgeous & picturesque 
Animals - Hilarious 
Hosts - Tracy was away during our visit but Chris was great, funny and super accomodating to us city folk. 
Personalised Touches - OMG who has pillow-top beds in Air BnB's ? Tracy and Chris do !!! The flowers, the candles .. we just all loved the welcoming style of this house.
Atmosphere - Homey, ohhh that fire was amazing 

We just loved our little girls vaycay for the night, thank you for having such an amazing property and give our love to the cheeky alpaca's. 

Diana xo"
35660705,484504044,2019-07-09,14338318,Michael,"Wonderful stay! the space is gorgeous and has everything you could need for several or one night stay, the fire was going when we arrived so the living room was toasty, the living room windows look out over the alpaca area which is entertaining. We mostly engaged with Chris who was passionate about the farm and was very welcoming, giving us the freedom to walk around the farm, enjoying the scenery, as well as take part in feeding and interacting with the alpacas as much as we liked. highly recommend!"
35660705,487345803,2019-07-14,173468805,Beth,"Thank you for such a wonderful few days. We loved the house, especially the woodfire! It was exactly how it was presented in the pictures. Hosts were available to answer any questions, and continually stock up the wood pile. We loved our stay!"

An amazing place to stay!"
35660705,490609014,2019-07-19,5413842,Julie,"Tracy and Chris were very welcoming and generous with their time, always happy to accommodate you. The property has many lovely design touches and is being thoughtfully restored/renovated. It is a lovely spot to both relax and truly unwind, or there are many nearby towns and attractions. Likewise there is plenty to amuse the family on the property, you can go for a walk and see kangaroos and many other animals, or interact  with and feed the alpacas. We learnt a lot about the breeding and behaviour of alpacas and our son loved hanging out with them."
35660705,491243985,2019-07-20,139216963,Lucy,"This place was above and beyond expectations cottage was lovely, fire place was fantastic and the extra touch of bacon and eggs for breakfast was great. Then there are the Alpacas and other wildlife around the place was just great. We will be back again when we need a getaway from it all."
35660705,491947156,2019-07-21,126073313,Jeremy,"Tracey’s place is a beautiful, serene piece of farmland out in the Adelaide hills. On top of an amazing herd of alpacas, expect an enthusiastic welcome and roaring fire when you arrive along with a bottle of local wine, paddocks, woodlots and dams to explore if you feel like it, and a comfortable, modern set out of the house. 

In the morning, wake up to the sunrise over the hills from a spectacular view out the bedroom window, and complimentary breakfast supplies. 

We were lucky to join in the morning feeding of the alpacas too, which was a pretty special experience.

Would recommend!"

35660705,494778382,2019-07-25,38150944,Pearl,"Very tidy and well decorated house in the tranquil suburbs of Barossa. It is also convenient, only five minutes to the town for grocery shopping. 
Tracy and Chris the host couple are very considerate and nice.  They lit the fireplace for us in advance before our arrival and prepared so many wood for us. They also invited us to feed their alpacas which are so cute and furry. 
We also saw several kangaroos in the barn.  
Very pleasant experience.  Highly recommended!

35660705,544355335,2019-10-10,20649854,Emma & Aurelie,"We were checked in by Chris. He really loves what he does and Is very passionate about all his projects on the farm.  He showed us around the land and he let us feed the alpacas which was a lovely experience. The Airbnb is perfectly kitted out for everything you would need. (Pots, pans, kettle, coffee, tea and milk  etc)They even provided breakfast. It was also lovely to have a nice fire to relax in front after a long day of travel. The beds were extremely comfortable and gave for a great night sleep.  
The location is wonderful.  It really gives you the opportunity to have a snap shot into Chris and Tracy’s life on their alpaca farm.  With the alpacas, wild birds and neighbouring kangaroos all outside your window, you really couldn’t ask for more.  We would highly recommend this airbnb. 
Keep up the great work and we hope you get your tractor sorted out soon!"
35660705,545254584,2019-10-12,52441694,Lisa,Amazing stay at Tracy's place. Beautiful location and so quiet. Tracy and Chris were so welcoming and showed us around the farm and we met the alpacas who were adorable. Chris has done a great job with all the renovations. Breakfast provisions were provided in the large fridge as well as a lovely bottle of wine. Loved this place and would highly recommend it as an escape from the city. Will definitely be back when next in S.A.
35660705,545758046,2019-10-13,44781093,DoubleK,"First time farm stay expensive,  loving it.
Tracy and Chris both are super nice persons sharing how they renovate the farm, how B&B work and a lot of knowledge of the alpaca...
All alpacas are lovely and adorable.
Highly recommended ! Sure will come back next time"

35660705,553345511,2019-10-24,11738296,Rachel,"Tracy and her husband, Chris were fantastic and friendly hosts. They met us in arrival and were prompt in communicating with us and accommodating our late check in. We loved the opportunity to meet the alpacas and the walk of the property, there are so many wild kangaroos around. The fact that you can see the stars in the sky at night also really brings home the fact that you’re away in the country! 

The bnb is comfortable and fitted out well with beautiful furnishings (some made with alpaca fur, which can be purchased), also there is a full-functioning kitchen with utensils and ingredients for preparing meals. Tracy very generously left bacon and eggs for us in the fridge so we had breakfast in the bnb both mornings while we stayed there. Location-wise we were well placed to cover both Hahndorf and Barossa, both about half an hour away give or take.

We had a great time and would recommend this bnb to anyone who wants a farm stay away from the city, in the quiet of the country."
35660705,555687180,2019-10-27,139547303,Elise,We had an amazing stay with our host Tracy. We loved every minute of it.

Tracy is so welcoming and warm, the house is gorgeous, so comfortable, spacious and very stylish (we adored the super soft fluffy towels and the super comfy bed!). We went on an amazing walk with Tracy around the property, accompanied by her three gorgeous dogs and saw kangaroos and fed the lovely alpacas - it was the best Sunday morning we've had and really slept so late in the mornings as the property is so peaceful and quiet. We will definitely come back - would highly recommend. Thanks Tracy x"

35660705,567205392,2019-11-21,298149997,Timothy,"Staying at the fantastic place of Tracy and Chris was a wholesome and wonderful experience. They are so kind and nice hosts and we felt at home immediately. The separate house for guests is spacious, well equipped and super cosy. Interacting with the Alpacas was really fun and we got to learn a lot about them in the process.

One of the highlights is seeing millions of stars under night sky. It is so beautiful as there is absolutely no light pollution and it is something we all enjoyed which we can not do in the city.
 
I would highly recommend to stay at Gundaroo in the Barossa Valley."
35660705,569885173,2019-11-27,1597476,Daniel,"We loved our stay at Gundaroo Cottage. Tracy and Christ are delightful as are the herd of alpacas across the field. Highly recommended for a friendly, local and relaxed AirBnB experience. Thanks again!"

35660705,584989528,2019-12-30,182194725,Savanthi,"This is one of our best holidays ever. We were made to feel at home from the time we got off our vehicle. We loved every minute we spent at the farm. The accommodation is simple, elegant, stylish and homely. Tracey and Chris are truly super super hosts. They did a lot more than what we expected to make our stay beautiful. We loved being outdoor with the Alpacas, watching the sunset ( stunning indeed) , the quiet personified space, the local tips and the generosity of the hosts. Our daughter loved spending time outdoors in the tractor and being a little helper to Chris. ( not so sure if she actually helped)Tracey for taking her time off to escort us. Well I can go on and on, you got to stay here to really experience as words are not sufficient to explain !"
35660705,586496823,2020-01-01,7485599,Karina,"Tracy and Chris’ Airbnb is the perfect place for a relaxing getaway. The accommodation is located in the middle of several South Australian iconic areas including the Barossa Valley, Claire Valley, Adelaide Hills and Lobethal. 
We were warmly welcomed by both Chris and Tracy who graciously introduced  us to their beautiful property and alpacas! We even got to feed them which was a fun experience. 
The Airbnb was clean, tidy and fully equipped. We much appreciated the stocked fridge of breakfast supplies and bottle of wine! For anything else, shops were a short drive away. 

I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this Airbnb for anyone looking for a quiet and relaxing farm stay."

Tracy and Chris were absolutely wonderful hosts, and we really enjoyed our time at their AirBnB.  

We LOVED visiting and feeding the alpacas - they have such unique, interesting personalities!! Tracy took us on a tour around the property, and helped us set up a wine tour, which was perfect :-) We got to see some wild kangaroos on the property - very cool (except for the fact that they like to eat the grass, so maybe not so fun for the lawn). We also had an amazing BBQ dinner one night, and their 2 sweet doggos finally warmed up to us enough to hold for a bit (which I loved, because I missed my pup back home!)!

The renovations they have done on this property are amazing, they have a photo album to show what things looked like when they first bought it, and wow - very impressive! Excellent style choices for the renovations and decor!

Overall, a very fun, relaxing stay, and we would highly recommend this location to anyone! Thank you Chris and Tracy!!! <3"
35660705,595321529,2020-01-19,244426564,Fionn,Tracy and Chris have an amazing setup in the Barossa. They are the most wonderful hosts and designate so much of their time to ensuring we got the most enjoyment from our time with them.

35660705,597560707,2020-01-25,23316314,Melissa,"Tracy & Chris are such lovely people! They were a pleasure to get to know. It was our first time to Adelaide and they were definitely a contributing factor in making it an unforgettable experience. 

The Airbnb was very stylish and homey. The beds were super comfortable and the amenities were very clean. 

The highlight was being able to spend time with their adorable alpacas, dogs and cat. They took the time to educate us about the alpacas, and allowed us to pet and feed them. We must’ve taken thousands of pictures as they are incredibly cute. 

I would strongly recommend staying at this Airbnb as not only was the location convenient, but the experience is one of the best experiences I’ve ever had through Airbnb.

PS If you have the opportunity to see the property you will see how perfect they are in being contestants on The Block! Make sure you pester them about it, particularly Chris. He’ll get the hint soon enough."

They had everything thought of for our stay ( stocked kitchen,towels, full use of the kitchen, games , tv, fan , heater etc)Thank you fit the lovely bottle of wine  . I probably had the best sleep ever thanks to their amazing bed and even the couch was so soft and really comfy . The highlight of the stay was of course interacting with the alpacas , feeding and petting them . Tracy took a lot of time explaining all about Alpacas since we knew nothing much about them coming from Singapore.  They also have 2 very cute dogs and a friendly cat who allowed us to pet them as well .  I only wish we could have stayed on longer . One night is not enough in this wonderful place . Tracy and Chris are just such incredible people and I can’t wait to stay there again and hopefully be able to drop by soon to see the alpaca babies!  Once again, thank you Chris and Tracy and we wish you all the best in your future endeavours . ♥️"

And Tracy was more than happy to show us the animals and let us feed them.  The two dogs and cat also came to visit us which I loved. Super friendly hosts! We felt very welcomed. There are also alot of wild kangaroos on the property which is a plus. Perfect place for an animal lover like me. Will definitely be back again.

We had a great time with our friends on this weekend getaway and felt truly relaxed. Our only regret is not having more time there. Tracy took us to meet and feed her alpacas. She was also very accommodating in letting us check-out late so we could have lazy Sunday morning. They are kind, genuine people who have a passion for their animals and the Airbnb. Hope to come back again!"

My husband and I enjoyed our little getaway in the middle of raw nature - so peaceful and serene, with the cosiness of the fireplace being the cherry on top. The alpacas are the simple definition of love at first sight, we couldn't get enough of them. Best bit is the morning coffee on the deck overlooking the alpacas, wild joeys and morning mist. We wholeheartedly recommend this magical experience."

The house was lovely and cosy and the fireplace was already burning when we arrived which was so nice. The views of the farm and the alpacas from the house were beautiful and relaxing. The drive to the property was stunning and we saw so many kangaroos and farm animals. At night you can hear the crickets which is so beautiful. Only 30 mins from Angaston for a day trip and only 10 mins from a few other lovely towns. Would 100% recommend this place!
35660705,655819480,2020-08-24,105544039,Tegan,Amazing stay! Would highly recommend! This place is really not far from the city but feels so quiet and relaxing. We loved being close to the Barossa region and spent time exploring the local wineries. However we also loved being able to just relax in front of the fireplace and look out at the view. Definitely a perfect place for a winter getaway but would also be great to visit in summer. The alpacas of course are so gorgeous and truly a highlight! We were able to wander around the farm and see all the alpacas whenever we wanted. Tracy and Chris also took us for a walk around and let us feed the alpacas before we left which was fantastic! The place was clean and had all the amenities we needed with extra touches like breakfast a bottle of wine and plenty of firewood. We will be back!

All the essentials like oil, salt, rice, pepper etc were there and were even provided with bacon, eggs and milk. They also have a Nespresso machine! We loved waking up in the morning, having a leisurely breakfast on the deck with the sun beaming down on us. Then going for a beautiful walk through the farm, and giving the animals a pat. We traveled with our six year old who thought it was the best holiday ever because Tracy kindly took her for a ride on the tractor, we also loved taking the baby Alpacas for a walk on the lead, they are really cute and funny!! There are lots of kangaroos around the property as well who would race us in our car! Chris and Tracy were the best hosts ever, always made sure we had everything we needed and topped up our firewood every day. The house is about 10 minutes to Gumeracha and Birdwood which was fun visiting the big rocking horse and the Birdwood motor museum. There were also lots of board games in the cupboard which was a pleasant surprise. This vacation is perfect if you want a quiet getaway and love animals and nature we will be back!"

We loved having a glass of wine (that the hosts provided for us) on the couch by the fire while listening to the rain outside on the deck.

If you're lucky you'll get a visit from one of the furry friends!

Fantastic spot and will be back if we are in the area again!"
35660705,673107980,2020-10-11,207897647,Peter,"Tracy and Chris are really lovely people and they made us feel super welcome. The house is clean, comfortable, spacious well equipped and, thanks to a very efficient wood heater and a plentiful supply of firewood, beautifully warm. The alpacas are really gorgeous and we were lucky enough to be able to watch some being shorn - a first for both of us. The location is ideal, with the entire Barossa Valley within easy reach for a day trip and the northern Mount Lofty Ranges, with lots of fascinating little villages in the opposite direction, not to mention the National Motor Museum just down the road at Birdwood. There are 3 reservoirs nearby with opportunities for fishing, walking or birdwatching. With 4 conservation parks and Mt Crawford Forest in the surrounding area there are numerous walking trails including sections of the famous Heysen Trail. We will definitely be back."

Miss the naughty George, the cute KF Panda and Gold Star already (sorry don't remember all their names but they are all super cute.)  I'm back at work in Adelaide today and have been telling all my workmates how special it was to wake up and see alpacas moving in front of your bedroom window and kangaroos hopping around in the early morning outside the kitchen window. As expected, the house is clean and comfortable, we feel very much at home. There are all essentials in the pantry with fresh milk, eggs, bacon etc. in the fridge, as well as the complimentary bottle of wine.  There is a Nespresso machine with a variety of capsules and a wide range of Twinings tea provided. Tracy is quick in responding to my messages and has done a great job in managing this Airbnb property . As a local SA resident, now that we are not encouraged to travel interstate or overseas, I highly recommend this farm stay for a special weekend getaway. Kids will love the alpacas and there are so much to do in the neighborhood: The Big Rocking Horse is only 10 minutes away and the Whispering Wall 15 minutes drive. Thank you Tracy and Chris, all the best and Merry Christmas!"

We enjoyed our days waking up to the alpacas feeding on the hills and ending the evenings out on the deck watching the kangaroos, bird life and clear night skies. The cottage was set with everything we needed, with a comfortable bed and all the staples. Tracy and Chris were warm, welcoming and generous and even invited us to hand feed the alpacas!

A romantic space, with high end finishes 

What a lovely space, cottage, and we would have wished we could have stayed longer, and wish the Barossa region was fully operational at what it does best for tourists 

At  short notice Brooke and Peter were able to accomodate myself- someone who had just had chemotherapy- and ensure a high end clean accommodation and with covid - no contact. Utterly professional and amazing communication 
A beautiful area and space 
Hopeful that perhaps once the ‘C’ word (both covid and cancer) are finished with- we will able to return 

A clean and beautiful cottage design and high end finishes throughout, Amazing outdoor garden area 

Beds- mattress where high end and pillows where amazingly soft 
An amazing bath/ jet bath for those sore muscles

We truly drove 85kms out of our way to stay the night here, and it was worth it"

Functional kitchen for cooking, very comfortable bed which is difficult to get out of and a large bathroom with spa bath and shower which has great pressure. A bonus for me was the hair dryer that didn’t frizz the hair. There were some breakfast supplies and my husband was pretty happy with the coffee machine. The gardens were nice and was a peaceful location. Communication with Brooke was very efficient. Highly recommend."

36184899,630462372,2020-06-18,79369859,Rachel,"This is without doubt an outstanding experience in the heart of a South Australian wine region. The property and grounds are impeccably presented and the appointment and comfort was of the highest standard we could possibly have imagined when we arrived. Not only was every space thoughtfully appointed, designed and put together it was warm, welcoming, clean and classy. We felt safe and delighted to spend some time there - our only criticism was that we did not have enough time to stay longer! 

Our Hosts were able to help us with our activities and dinner bookings as well as providing us with assistance within minutes of inquiry. They were not only responsive, helpful and timely but so pleasant to deal with.

The wine and chocolate‘s were a beautiful touch, the linen on the beds perfectly crisp and of a high quality, the furniture stylish and comfortable, even the books on the bookcases were not only interesting but complimented the internal colour scheme and coordinated in hues of blue and mustard.  As an interior designer myself the property was one of the absolute best I have had the pleasure of staying in and I cannot wait to book again to spend more time with the filtered light coming through the windows and explore the plethora of interesting books.

The house is perfect and has so many little touches that just make your stay even better. The beds were very comfortable and the living room was perfect for reading a book, or drinking the complimentary bottle of wine while enjoying a movie. The kitchen is equipped with everything you could possibly need, and if you don’t feel like cooking there are plenty of restaurants a short drive from Lyndoch, as well as two pubs and a cafe in close proximity.

36184899,714186662,2020-12-07,78252652,Leigh,"Absolutely delightful stay in this beautiful fully restored cottage. The thoughtful extra touches and ammenities was beyond expectations. Hubby and I are huge animal lovers and it was great to feed the 2 possums that live in the outside wine cellar and come out at night in the almond tree to greet you. The cottage was cosy and homely and everything was so thoughtfully thought out. Breakfast cereal packets in the cupboard, coffee pods, cartons of milk, butter, other condiments and bathroom ammenities were all at hand if wanted, those touches are what sets this place above others. Our first experience staying at an Airbnb and we worried as to what we should expect but was definitely beyond all expectations, Brooke was only a message away if we needed her and she was always prompt and helpful with our questions. I have recommended this cottage to family and friends for their next stay in the Barossa. If your looking for a home base in the Barossa then you can’t go past Ironstone on Jollytown, trust me you will not be disappointed especially if you love animals and want to interact with Jolly the possum and her mate. Thankyou Brooke and Peter for a beautiful week at the Barossa ☺️ xx"

36498929,625831065,2020-05-24,49526102,Emil,"Great location, walking distance to lovely shops (Living by Design, Alabaster), terrific restaurants — Musque (the 5 course lunch is superb - so skip breakfast on the day), Vino Lokal (the Reuben is a religious experience), and Char Barossa (terrific burgers). Spacious house, nice living room, TV with great entertainment options, very comfy bed in Master bedroom.  Find time to visit the Barossa Chocolate Factory and drop by the Kalleske Cellar Door - primo vino lokal."
36498929,628838385,2020-06-11,165762194,Jasson,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying here and would’ve stayed longer if we had the time. Maz made the whole experience easy and seamless. The house is large enough for a small family or a couple of friends. 

The house comes equipped with everything you need. The laundry has a dryer and washer, bathroom has heating lamps with spare shampoo and hair dryer, lounge room has lots of streaming services, board games for families to play and a security blind for privacy.  The bedrooms are large with plenty of cupboards to hang clothes for long stays. The kitchen really does have everything you can want and then some. Maz thoughtfully left bacon, eggs, bread, milk and juice to start your day. 

It does get cold in Tanunda but there are heaters in most rooms including the kitchen. 

Every room is beautifully decorated and feels like home. I would definitely stay here again."

36498929,658087142,2020-08-30,92052096,Annie,"Maz’s home is the perfect place to base yourself for a weekend in the Barossa. So close to Tanunda’s Main Street restaurants and shops and not far from heaps of great wineries. 

The house is clean and tidy with plenty of comfy touches- however we recommend bringing a torch as the interior lighting can be confusing and some lights don’t work. 

The front porch is a great place to unwind with a local wine after a busy day tasting! We would definitely stay here again!"

36774681,551095443,2019-10-19,157426943,Hamish,"Perfect setting, well presented cottage, private cellar with some of the hosts own wine which he makes from the vineyards you overlook, plunge pool and driving range. Do you need any more than that!?

We got engaged in the plunge pool and couldn’t have hoped for a better spot for it!"
36774681,553743251,2019-10-25,61854783,Julia,"INCREDIBLE air bnb!! Plung pool overlooks vineyard, private wine cellar, a friendly dog to take you for a walk around the vineyard, a free bottle of wine, gin tasting and chocolate in the fridge. Definitely will be coming back!"

The house was really comfortable and well set up. 
And we loved the local treats left for us. 
We highly recommend this place and hope to return some day. 
Thank you!"
36774681,560496712,2019-11-07,304355461,Vince,"our family of 2 adults and 2 kids (2 and 4 year old) had an excellent stay. Scott was easy to communicate with and the extra touches to accommodate the kids were really appreciated including toys and books for them to play with, toasting marshmallows over the fire by the river, rides on the polaris to view the vineyard.
The property is very clean with all the modern amenities including a heated plunge pool overlooking the vineyards.
There is also a cellar which you can pick wine from to enjoy during your stay.
Highly recommend this property for families or for a romantic getaway."
36774681,568054709,2019-11-24,158230520,Catie,"We absolutely loved our stay at Scott’s place. There were so many thoughtful touches, including gin to sample, wine and chocolate. We really enjoyed using the beautiful plunge pool and thought all facilities were great. Would definitely stay here again and were very sad to leave!"

36774681,590211573,2020-01-07,14319675,Alysha,"Our stay at the little cottage was amazing! It has been restored very tastefully and has everything you could want in a relaxing setting. The plunge pool was exceptional and we made good use of it! The beds were super comfy and the linen and towels were high quality. We really enjoyed the cellar and the opportunity to try some of the wines grown and made at the vineyard. The house is in a great location, walking distance to Murray Street. We would absolutely stay again - fantastic, friendly hosts, always happy to share their local recommendations. Thank you Jan, Craig and Scott."
36774681,590919198,2020-01-10,14529801,Dani,"If we could give this place 6 stars, we would. The view is spectacular and the cottage has been beautifully renovated. The plunge pool is an absolute treat! Scott was incredibly accomodating and it was great talking with him about his vineyard and wines (which are amazing!)."
36774681,597609347,2020-01-26,65976620,Varda,"If we could have given Rogasch Cottage 10 stars we would have!  A superb little gem hidden away amongst the vines within 5 minutes walking distance to the main street bustling with cafe's and restaurants.  Scott was such a welcoming host along with Jan and Craig - nothing was too much trouble.  We enjoyed a private tour of the micro-vineyard as well as joining them fo (Website hidden by Airbnb) on our first night.  Beautifully renovated, the Cottage is a mix of old and new with all the luxuries one could ever ask for along with your very own stocked cellar.  Wine, local gin, chocolate and even a litre of milk in the fridge welcomed us on our arrival.   Carefully thought through touches make this place an absolute must stay.  Watching sunset in the plunge pool is something we will remember for a long time.  We were sad to leave but are already planning on a return stay!  Outstanding Air BnB :)"
36774681,599630076,2020-01-30,307126948,Nigel,Very comfortable cottage in a great location. Worth a stay just to watch the sunset from the pool.
36774681,600486121,2020-02-01,19082,Alana,This place is amazing! Staying here really made our trip to the Barossa extra special. The plunge pool with views over the vineyards was a highlight and my partner also had fun on the driving range next to the house. Each night you can go down into your private cellar and choose a bottle of wine which was a lovely touch. We cooked in the old fire oven on the balcony but there's also a fully equiped kitchen. There's local gins to taste with capi tonic in the fridge. Also chocolate! and milk for your nespresso is all provided. We never wanted to leave the house. It's also only 5 mins walk from town and close by to so many good wineries. Even though you're right in the thick of it you feel miles away. This would have to be one of my favourite airbnb's I've ever stayed in.
36774681,602171830,2020-02-05,239854999,Tanner,"Absolutely phenomenal place... nuff said...
Gorgeous view, great place for good times.


Jan, Craig , and Scott where awesome people very down to earth and relatable.

Can’t thank them enough for offering up this place!!"
36774681,606067481,2020-02-15,234928036,Brandon,"The cottage is setup to take advantage of the amazing vineyard views, it’s so relaxing either on the couch or in the pool. Was really happy with the quality of the appliances and furnishings. Retrieving a night cap from the cellar was a real novelty. Its walking distance from the coffee shops and restaurants on the main street which made it so easy after a night enjoying a couple of glasses of wine. Would definitely recommend a stay here."
36774681,609425968,2020-02-23,277750041,Camille,"If ever near the Barossa, look no further for accommodation...this place has it all. Perfect place to rest and relax with stunning views, sunsets and plunge pool!"
36774681,613833181,2020-03-03,55522830,Sydney,"Amazing renovated cottage in the heart of Barossa within walking distance of Tanunda’s main street. 
Every detail is thoughtfully taken care of and the facilities are of a very high standard. 
The hosts, Jan, Craig, Scott are very inviting and always available when required. 
Ten stars out of five."
36774681,616153107,2020-03-08,45124734,Tamara,"The place is lovely. Small, but high quality bed linen, modern features and views to die for. The pool was utterly gorgeous and everything was thought of down to kitchen provisions and the cool choose your own cellar feature.

Do I think it was worth $700 a night for a relatively small space that is basically an annex to next door? No. On our first night, I returned home to find a man urinating outside the property....witnessed by my small children and he was so drunk he splayed his genitalia around-they were upset to say the least. I contacted the host immediately who said he’d look into it...yet we received no response. This was utterly unacceptable. 

The house needs to be advertised as a tack on to the main house, there isn’t a lot of room or privacy, but the views, cellar (be careful of the door, my partner received a black eye as it dropped down on his face) were super cool. Great location 3/5 stars $1,400 a weekend? Totally overpriced."
36774681,618915274,2020-03-16,101597463,Simon,"Perfect place to explore the Barossa from, the location is a walk to the village and a short drive to most vineyards. The property is a tasteful mix of modern and period and very nicely finished. The pool and cellar are great touches, we loved our stay here"
36774681,619553478,2020-03-18,91389399,Brie,We absolutely loved our stay! The vineyard views were stunning and we loved the amazing spa and celler! The extra details such as complimentary wine and chocolate were lovely! We can’t wait to come back!

Scott and family went above and beyond - appreciated the wine tasting, quick responses to anything, the bedding was beautiful, heated pool was  fabulous and really appreciated such a thoughtful and unexpected birthday present. Would definitely stay again."
36774681,631595679,2020-06-23,113898501,Sophie,The most amazing central/hidden location! Thanks so much for an epic stay x
36774681,634667528,2020-07-04,349710449,Jamie,"Amazing location situated right in the heart of everything but still secluded and private. The cottage was absolutely beautiful and had so many added extras we never expected. High end bedding, towels and furniture made it feel like a luxury resort. Pool was a real winner for us with amazing views. Scott was absolutely amazing, couldn’t have asked for anyone better. He was so friendly and helpful organising us a tour of a winery close by and giving us a private tasting of his micro winery on the property. Would 100% recommend to everyone and we will definitely be back again!"
36774681,636314587,2020-07-10,179664837,Jennifer,"What a fabulous place! Everything you need to feel relaxed: beautiful views, heated pool, open fire, coffee and wine.  Conveniently close to everything but with privacy as well as lots of space to explore. The owners have done an excellent job with the finer details including beautiful linen, and also creating special spots to sit and relax both inside and out."
36774681,637006996,2020-07-11,39794726,Brooke,"We loved our stay so much, we can’t wait to organise another stay towards the end of the year as there really wasn’t enough time to enjoy how much your beautiful place has to offer!"
36774681,643125882,2020-07-27,257454628,Sarah,"Absolutely beautiful place and location. So much more than we expected, definitely worth the cost. The wine tasting and tour of the property with Scott and Craig, just made our last night so special. It was great to hear and see the history and taste the wine that has been produced from the vines we looked over during our stay. Perfect location in Tanunda, close to town but also very private, and the house is just spectacular."
36774681,649244309,2020-08-10,55980333,Luke,"This place is far better than the pictures show... Which is hard to believe.
Everything was perfect, and the free wine, gin and port was the icing on the cake.
The heated pool was unbelievable, we spent all day there.

And to top it off a free wine tasting, all Scott's wine were awesome, we are looking forward to purchasing some bottles when this vintage is released.

11/10 
Don't miss out on Booking this place!"

36774681,654015102,2020-08-21,101776612,Kym,Great place. Location is fantastic. Scotty was friendly and we enjoyed the wine tasting. Wish we went when it was warmer and less rain so we could enjoy the patio more.

36774681,656220058,2020-08-25,41241832,Dieter,"We had an amazing time at Scott's cottage! There are countless little gems throughout the accommodation from the amazing views in the heated pool to the private cellar stocked with wine made from the property's produce. We also did a tasting with Scott and really loved the experience. We couldn't have asked for a more relaxing experience, with our goal of getting out of the city. Looking forward to visiting again!"
36774681,660031152,2020-09-04,10719245,Rebekah,"Gorgeous spot. Highlights were the hot tub overlooking the vineyard, the fireplace and the little wine cellar. Lovely."
36774681,661974901,2020-09-08,329547467,Laura,"An absolutely gorgeous cottage in such a peaceful spot - you wouldn’t know you were only a minute from the main street. The plunge pool was as warm as a bath with beautiful views, and the cottage itself was bright & airy whilst maintaining the character and charm of the original home. 
Can’t wait to come back the next time we visit the Barossa."
36774681,664972584,2020-09-16,2975011,Nicole,"Fab stay! The plunge pool was amazing (and heated to 35 degrees!). Inside was stunning, cellar was cute and the bath tub! Wow!  
Netflix on the TV, Nespresso machine and only a short stroll to town It’s perfect!"
36774681,665905465,2020-09-19,139383519,Alysha,"We had the most amazing time. The pool and driving range were the highlights and we loved the location. My only recommendation would be some more basic pantry staples (butter, vegemite, cereals, etc) as this would have made our stay that little bit more convenient ☺️"
36774681,668929452,2020-09-28,356136929,Andrew,Amazing location and host. My partner and I had such a great time. From the beautiful plunge pool overlooking the vineyards to having our own cellar the weekend was just wonderful.

36774681,673689235,2020-10-12,3455767,Sarah,"With an excellent location just off the Tanunda Main Street, Rogasch Cottage is just the right balance of comfort, style, privacy and personal touches in a superbly renovated old cottage that will surprise and delight! Our young family enjoyed an indulgent weekend complete with sunset swims, vineyard views and cosy fires and found this to be the perfect setting to relax at the end of a busy day. Equally we could have stayed put the whole time with more than adequate amenities for self-catering and generally relaxing and unwinding in luxe surrounds. Scott was quick to respond to enquiries and went out of his way to ensure we had everything we needed. The micro tasting on the property was an absolute highlight and a nightcap in the cellar before bed time was not to be missed! Don’t deliberate. Just book!"
36774681,702247449,2020-10-20,235097248,Philip,"This place was amazing, awesome views the pictures don’t to it justice. Positioned close to everything, although you won’t want to leave this little oasis. Will be returning for sure."
36774681,702630693,2020-10-22,54953384,Andy,"A truly luxurious home that provided wonderful relaxation at the end of each day. All the homely touches including the gin, muscat, and wine samples by the private pool made it the highlight of the trip. Additionally, we found the house to be walking distance from anywhere in Tanunda including Turkey Flat winery.

I’d recommend the house to any as a staycation destination in itself, with trips out to the wineries as a bonus add-on."
36774681,703460476,2020-10-25,371884858,Brandon,"Perfect getaway spot at tanunda in barossa valley looking over the vineyard with a nice glass of wine from there private wine cellar is one of a kind. The heated 35 degree spa is amazing with the view. Gorgeous cottage to take the next step for a romatic proposal, nonetheless 5 star and couldnt ask for a better place to stay."
36774681,704360936,2020-10-27,71599778,Alex,"What a place!! From the kangaroos between the vines in the morning, to using the old bread oven for stone baked pizza in the evening. It’s an amazing place... and super close to Tanunda town centre. It was everything we hoped it would be and couldn’t give a higher recommendation. Scott makes some incredible wines too!!"
36774681,705572728,2020-10-31,277451306,Kelsi,Absolutely LOVELY getaway. The thoughtful touches around the house and efforts made by the hosts made the experience even better. Craig was an absolute legend for taking us around the vineyard for a wine tour. His hospitality was excellent and to take time out of his day to show us around didn’t go unappreciated. The place itself was stunning and very comfortable. It was just the perfect place to spend some time with my family for the weekend. My parents were even more impressed with the experience than I was. I’m so glad we were able to support such a deserving family on this stay! 10/10 stay!!

36774681,709824674,2020-11-19,365032157,Heather,Great location and amazing views and lovely hosts.
36774681,714614852,2020-12-10,88420405,Tracey,"Absolutely beautiful place to stay.
We had the best of both worlds. 
Week started off quite chilly,  so was great to sit by fireplace at night with  wine out of the cottage cellar ( 1 bottle a day included in stay), and then the weather became quite warm by end of our stay,  so was fantastic sitting in hot tub overlooking the vineyards.
The beds are so comfortable,  we slept like babies.
There is an outdoor bbq, plus an outdoor pizza oven.
We were able to walk around the property and into the vineyards, and Scott ( the host) even gave us a wine tasting from the barrels, and from the bottled wine.
5 min walk into main st of Tanunda.
Can't wait to stay here again"
36774681,715813061,2020-12-16,345431238,Kayla,"My wife and I were very much looking forward to rounding off our honeymoon with a few nights at Rogasch Cottage, and we weren’t disappointed. Every element of this stay is superbly thought out, from the coffee selections, having both beach and bath towels, TV and aircon in every room, and wine for each night you stay. We had a real blast doing the wine tasting with Scott, and even had the privilege of buying some AMAZING wine they produced on the property. Though an expensive stay, there is not a single cent wasted and we will definitely come back in the future. Well done guys! Elijah and Kayla"

Scott was a fantastic host he was prompt and very thorough with communicating to us and we were lucky to go on his micro brewery tour and learnt about his wine making and history about the cottage and vineyard. The view was amazing and the plunge pool was amazing. Everything listed was perfect and couldn’t have asked for a better stay. We will be recommending this to our friends and family.
36774681,722667455,2021-01-08,12189346,Predrag,"An amazing place, location, host and experience. Would gladly go back and will make sure to look for the wine brands in the future. Many thanks for an awesome time."

36774681,730272285,2021-02-10,4194666,Marc,"From start to finish it was a memorable stay. Scott helped me get in touch with a local boutique florist and when they delivered it prior to checkin, Scott placed them in a vase in the perfect spot. 
The plunge pool is pure bliss and always warm. Once you get in, you’ll struggle wanting to leave. Not only is the view of the vineyards iconic; but also the lack of light pollution at night gives you a beautiful look into the nights stars. 
There were many amazing touches, from a stocked wine cellar with a complimentary bottle, to a tipple of local gin. 
Thank you for hosting us!"
36774681,732083216,2021-02-17,385177247,Liam,"Was an amazing getaway, the view was fantastic, wine was delicious and lived up to all expectations.

36774681,736596410,2021-03-06,50119451,Richard,"A beautiful cottage which is both very comfortable and nicely appointed. 

The cottage / location has an interesting history (documented on-site) and a certain charm as a result. It’s quite remote (right on the edge of town) and is close to nature. The night skies (when cloudless) are spectacular.

It’s in a good location (Tanunda and it’s restaurants are in walking distance). The great views, plunge pool, usable fireplaces and wine cellar make it extra special.

Scott and Jan are hospitable hosts with a range of nice touches thrown in."

We were lucky enough to have a tour and private tasting of the Forage Supply Co wine list grown on the property which was a highlight of our stay, if you get a chance, make sure you do it too. 
I would highly recommend this property to anybody looking for a central, relaxing and picturesque base to their Barossa adventure."

The house is spacious, beds are very comfortable and the shower is great. The kitchen has everything you need to cook for yourself. We really appreciated being given some local muesli, bacon and fresh eggs to use during our stay. We would happily stay again."

Living and kitchen areas are very open with high ceilings and big windows. 
Tucked away on its own, but so close to the Main Street of Nuri, it’s a perfect spot for a family getaway. We stayed here to be close to family for Christmas and will be back for sure.
Rosa is lovely. Very quick to respond to all enquiries by text or email, and met us for a quick chat on checkout. Thank you "

Because the house is actually better than the pics shown. It’s a new house with immaculate condition. Very soft Sheridan towels and linens. The beds are comfortable. Kevin has bad back and he’s fussy of mattress, however he hasn’t complained his sleep. We highly recommend the house."

My only note for others with young kids would be that the portacot provided did not have a mattress (instead they had a folded up doona on wooden slats) but it wasn't an issue for us as we had coincidentally brought a mattress.

Would stay again!"

37733817,565817013,2019-11-17,44902521,John,"This house is an excellent base for a visit to the Barossa Valley. The house is so well equipped and furnished that it will satisfy the most demanding visitors. The supply of basic requirements and breakfast options is perfect. All you need to buy is fresh bread from the baker next door. 

Tanunda has some great restaurants all within an easy walk and the house guide gives you valuable tips. There is a very good supermarket close at hand and plenty of good coffee shops to choose from. A safe, secure and roomy garage for the car and easy access to the house for all guests. 

All in all a great find and we have no hesitation in strongly recommending it to others and if we are ever in the area again we would certainly look to book it."

37733817,615385900,2020-03-07,83684996,Anne,"Whilst this place is not cheap, it is set up with everything we needed and more, with multiple generous touches throughout the stay.  From start to finish, communication was brilliant, the house was all in tip top condition, the little extras including food and drinks and fine quality shampoos and so on added to the sense of enjoyment and value for money.  We wanted to leave a little later than the check out time as it worked for our next social engagement and the hosts allowed that with no quibble = we felt cared about."

37733817,640330766,2020-07-20,59964391,Rosemary,"This place was exactly what we were after. Comfortable - so much so that we could relax in the home. Perfect location - easy walking distance to all restaurants, cafes and hotels. 
The balance of this was ideal, as we live in a small town, eating out was important, and the ease of getting home was fabulous! 
The little touches that were included really did make the house a home - we travelled from 3hours away and get some snack when we arrived was great!! 
Thanks so much, we will stay again!"

Highly recommend Ruby’s Residence for a luxurious yet cozy stay in the Barossa.

Lizha and Geoff have gone above and beyond in terms of thoughtful amenities that you might forget, as well as leaving milk, orange juice, tea, nespresso coffee and a few little treats in the kitchen.
The house was clean, smelt lovely and during our stay we felt just like we were at home.
Lizha and Geoff responded promptly whenever I needed to message them. I would definitely stay here again."

The guest house is on the edge of the Barossa Valley but not far at all to drive to wineries and restaurants. We were also able to get a taxi from Altona to go out to dinner which was very convenient. The location is super quiet which is great for relaxing - and we even got to see some kangaroos! The guesthouse has everything that you could need, is beautifully decorated and extremely clean. I definitely recommend staying at Tamu Barossa."

We saw lots of kangaroos and birds. We went for walks in nature at the conservation park right across the road. We saw lots of beautiful wild flowers. 

The house is very clean and comfortable and quiet. The location is close enough to town to make it quick and convenient to jump in the car and get supplies or go out for a meal. Bianca’s dining suggestions are spot on. We had some of the best food experiences ever. 

Bianca and her family are lovely. 

We strongly recommend this place."

37926946,668947465,2020-09-28,140676856,Jane,"We enjoyed staying at ‘Tamu Barossa’ which looks even better in real life than the photos show.  The cabin has been upgraded, with a fully functional kitchen and quality fixtures throughout.   It is located in a quiet, private area with views onto trees.  There is a wonderful and large walking reserve just a couple of hundred metres down the road where we saw kangaroos and lots of birds.  Wineries and the sculture park are also close by.  ‘Tamu Barossa’ is located in a tucked away part of the Baroosa, often overlooked.  Bianca is a gracious and warm host and not at all intrusive.   We have no hesitation recommending her place."

37926946,711524719,2020-11-26,34243206,Julie,"Tamu Cottage is a little oasis situated on a small property.  It offers complete comfort and tranquility with all the amenities that one would expect.  The cottage is so very clean and the fixtures of high quality - why would you want to stay in a hotel when you can stay here for a fraction of the price and the ambiance it offers.

The inclusion of quality breakfast provisions and bottle of wine are the icing on a particularly delicious cake.
A brewery, wineries and the pub are all on your doorstep.
Light a fire and settle in on a cold winter's night and you won't want to be anywhere else.
Virginia is super responsive to messages and provides timely information.
The Old Telegraph Station at Greenock is highly recommended."

The view from the front balcony was nothing short of the serenity that you would expect from a place such as the Barossa Valley, or ""the valley"" as the locals call it.

The property was clean, modern and had everything one might need inside.  placed just outside of Tanunda,  all the gorgeous sites of the Barroasa Valley were close by."

40433618,585015940,2019-12-31,109406030,Julian,"Couldn't have been happier with the stay. It's a newly built, well finished space with brilliant views of the vineyard to wake up to each morning. Little touches like the freshly cut flowers from the garden, locally sourced ingredients for a breakfast (which were absolutely delicious!), made the stay! Comfortable queen bed, great aircon and close to all that Barossa has to offer. Will be back again in winter time!"

40433618,597595469,2020-01-26,24130762,Trent,"Vineyard Views is a great property with a lovely outlook in a central location, perfect for couples looking to spend a weekend exploring the Barossa. Karl is a responsive host, and the space is clean, modern and well equipped - we particularly enjoyed the kitchenette and local produce for brekkie! A small thing worth noting is that property is located in a shed in the backyard of the main house, with a small privacy screen seperating the two spaces. This wasn't a major deal, but did make the deck feel less selculded. Overall, we had a great time at Vineyard Views and would recommend Karl's place to anyone visiting the Barossa."
40433618,603950926,2020-02-09,229655873,Madison,"Had a lovely weekend stay at Vineyard views. Close to all the Barossa valley vineyards, had everything you needed and beautiful views. Thanks Karl!"

Place is fantastic, clean and fully equip kitchen. Luxury but not over doing it. Comfortable and spacious. Like the natural theme and sundeck to have drink or two or three, so close to vineyard."
40433618,607535935,2020-02-18,25638446,Lucy,"Absolutely incredible. Having been to the Barossa a few times previously, staying at Karl’s place has made this time the most special. 
The apartment is awesome, super clean and comfortable and incredible views of the surrounding vines - especially at sunset. 
Karl was really friendly and welcoming (as were Jazzy and Ginger) - he even bailed us out when we arrived too late to get food anywhere. 
We really, really didn’t want to check out. 100% recommend."

Everything from the styling to the surprise breakfast goodies were a hit - and the incredible views go without saying. The location is also great - we stayed in for dinner to be able to enjoy it all but we easily would have been able to get outselves around to local eateries. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for accommodation in the Barossa and hope to go back ourselves.
40433618,614354277,2020-03-04,51462245,Tara,"Karl’s place was lovely, the place is beautiful set in amongst the grape vines. Karl was very helpful and attentive. Could not recommend more."

Hentley Farm Wines, Hayes Family Wines, Henschke, ... In the evening we enjoyed the most beautiful sunset on the terrace and we discovered many kangaroos next to our accommodation. We had a delicious breakfast from Karl in the fridge. Homemade honey, bread, bacon, eggs, tomatoes and butter. We love it and we will come back! Thank you so much Karl!"
40433618,615398685,2020-03-08,11351782,Michael,Karl is a fantastic host and the place is a perfect little getaway in the heart of wine country. Everything you need is there and it’s sparkling clean.

We made best friends with their sooky ginger cats that just wanted lots of pats. Even the dog came up for a nice pat during our short stay. Will be using this at our next stay for sure

Karl and Natalie were so accommodating and were such nice hosts, going out of their way to look after us. The selection of local produce was also a lovely touch.

40433618,723795292,2021-01-12,119261882,Simone,"Karl and Nat are incredible hosts  - they want to ensure that you have the most enjoyable stay possible. I would describe them as the epitome of true South Australian warmth and hospitality. 

“Vineyard Views” is the most spectacular Barossa Valley AirBNB. It felt like a dream come true to stay in a place where I could enjoy an al fresco dinning space and overlook the vineyards. Get your camera ready for those exquisite sunsets. 

I adored the layout inside as well. It is incredibly spacious and comfortable. I loved the stylish colour schemes that added to a wonderful experience. 

The location is perfect as you are only a short drive to several wineries, the Mengler’s Hill Sculpture and Barossa Adventure Parks. 

Thank you so much for ensuring that I had a brilliant first time in the Barossa."

40433618,738007562,2021-03-10,97306248,Ashley,"Where do I even start on how amazing this spot is. 

We came to the Barossa for our Honeymoon, as we arrived we were greeted by Karl for a quick gday. It was great to know who he was and where we were staying. Karl was great on the text and communication with us and happy for a call or text anytime. 

The actual room itself was 10/10 with all the little comforts you want. 
To start with the photos are spot on, walking out from your lounge area you are directly on the deck very close to Karl’s vineyard. Awesome to have a bottle of wine at the end of the day right on a real working vineyard. 

The whole room is brand new, high ceilings. We however loved the little things like;
- free wifi
- Apple TV with the ability to sign into Netflix 
- real, big towels and bath mat for the shower 
- really good strong shower with hot water 
- powerpoints right beside the bed for Charing phones etc. 

Karls hospitality was sensational. He answered any questions we had and really went above in beyond with us which we can’t thank him enough for. 

We were left in peace the whole time did not see any of Karl or his family unless we wanted to. 

All the taxi’s we got to and from town knew the address from previous guests and we didn’t have to explain where to go or how to get there. 

This is like a classic Air BnB experience but revamped to the 21st century.

And the view of the surrounding hills is quite a sight to wake up to. I loved that it was peaceful as there are no close neighbours. However, you are only a short drive from the main strip in Tanunda. Very handy for dashing in and out of town. Would highly recommend and we hope to visit again."
41405916,705570730,2020-10-31,22751236,Brendan,The house is nice but a bit tired. The house was full of millipedes mostly outside but a significant amount inside as well. Both toilets were blocked by the time we left. The house location is nice but on a long dirt track so a bit bumpy. The blinds in the rooms are not block out and we could see the blue sky through them so expect to wake up whenever the sun comes up. Overall it's a nice place and very big but for the price we paid I don't think it was great value for money.

41405916,712554605,2020-11-30,119706482,Elisabeth,"Triple Creek is well located for a time in the Barossa if you want to spend more time out of the house than in. It's spacious and the beds are comfortable and the linen fresh. There was however a very unpleasant smell of plastic / vinyl which needed to be expelled from the house every time we went in. This unfortunately brought many of the bugs in - and there were a lot! Provision  of little things, like insect repellent, coffee, sugar, normal tea bags (only green or earl grey was provided), more than one tea towel, cling wrap, a vegetable peeler, or sieve would have made it a little more comfortable. The outside area was not really pleasant or user friendly with the verandas being quite narrow. A little too expensive for what we thought it was / provided."

The location is PERFECT for exploring Barossa Valley right between Nuri and Tanunda, just perfect. Incredible views.

41800154,600483976,2020-02-01,178740261,Kaede,"I really appreciated Liz and her husband, Rudi for welcoming me warmly. I was gonna leave very early morning a day after I stayed but my plan had to change, so I asked them to stay there a bit longer until late morning. They didn’t mind at all and suggested me some alternative plans to do during the day. 
As we talked through it’d be quite helpful for guests if they prepared some brochures  for sightseeing, especially the area is  known as wineries. 
Overall I did have a nice time with the hosts and their puppies  Hope more guests stay with you and get more inspiration from them! 
If I visit the area in the near future, I’ll definitely come and stay longer there. Highly recommend ✅"

Thankfully, we came across Louise's Place and sent an inquiry if we could book for that day and the following..with relief we received a messaged back within minutes and were all sorted for our two night stay in the Barossa (Website hidden by Airbnb) family can't thank Louise enough for her clear communication, friendly manner and customer service in ensuring we got to enjoy a well deserved family breakaway...The journey became on our arrival to this beautiful property. Loved everything about it...the 3 king beds with quality linen, gorgeous ensuites in each bedroom, master chef kitchen, heated flooring for the chilly mornings, great outdoor space for the 9 and 2 year old to play, minute walk to the Tanunda shops which was perfect for all and so so much more.

His hospitality was perfect and the little touches throughout only added to the comfort of our stay. The location is far enough off the beaten track that you think you feel you’ve escaped to a quieter, slower part of the world while being close enough to Tanunda and all the major wineries and restaurants. However nearby are a heap of great wineries within stumbling distance and a sensational  little bakery. You won’t go wrong staying here"

42667491,736866635,2021-03-06,21466493,Jenni,If it’s peace and quiet this is the perfect spot. For a couple that enjoy natural surrounds Jasmins place is great. 10 minute stroll into Angaston which offers everything you need.

42718676,705580007,2020-11-01,151476309,Paula,"The auction yard was really nice. If staying with another couple need to realise that there is no wall from floor to ceiling for the bedrooms so you can talk to eachother and hear everything, ie talking snoring ect . It was a very unique place to stay.  Be careful with the highly polished bathroom tiles, our friends commented on how slippery they are and about 1hr later my partner fell over on the wet tiles.  We stayed for 3 nights and ate lunch and dinner at the location however had to buy dishwasher tablets as there were only one for each night which wasnt enough given the time we spent there. We booked thru Airnbnb however should have booked thru Jasmines own web page as for the same time Airbnb was $250 dollars more expensive. jasmine tried to help us out with resolving that problem and went out of her way but we couldn.t cancel and rebook thru her. Big difference in price."
42718676,706809958,2020-11-05,29149017,Jenny,A spacious delightful open spaced 2 bedroom house. Very clean with comfortable beds and large en-suite. It is in walking distance to Angaston and very close to the start of the Angaston to Nuriootpa cycle path. Highly recommend this Airbnb

43047801,637631873,2020-07-13,152771325,Sarah,"Melissa's place was absolutely spotless, stylish and cosy. We stayed 2 nights with our two year old and felt right at home straight away but still got to experience those little touches of holiday luxury. The cottage is a ten-minute walk to the really pretty main street with heaps of cafes and amenities, including two beautiful playgrounds. Melissa was a dream to communicate with. I would highly recommend a stay at this perfect spot."
43047801,639674509,2020-07-19,351903691,Mikaela,"Melissa's cottage was the perfect backdrop for our girl's weekend away in the Barossa Valley. The cottage itself is gorgeously styled, fully stocked with everything we needed (and more!), and the extra touches were so thoughtful. Melissa's local recommendations were excellent and even though weren't able to experience them all, we can't wait to come back again to finish the list! We can't rave enough about how smooth and easy communicating with Melissa was, the location of the cottage and and how the host had thought of absolutely everything - we were so impressed and can't wait to come back!!"
43047801,642450172,2020-07-26,356469957,Lucy,"Mel is prompt in answering questions and has truly gone above and beyond to create a calm, relaxing and beautiful space. The backyard is picturesque and the amenities are second to none.
It’s perfect for a girls weekend away or if you’re a couple looking for a romantic get away in the Barossa.
Angaston and the Main Street has lots to offer and delicious food and coffee.
It was all the personal touches that Melissa had that truly made us feel special and made our stay extra amazing.
Couldn’t recommend highly enough and we will most definitely be back."

It is beautifully furnished, with lots of thoughtful touches (including my favourite candle!), it is amazingly clean, has comfortable bedding and the most gorgeous outlook - we enjoyed a few cold glasses of wine admiring the view whilst our girls happily played the provided lawn games.  Everything is on your doorstep. Holiday bliss!  Mel is simply a wonderful host. 10/10 from us, thanks again!"

43047801,701333612,2020-10-18,326621732,Joanna,Melissa’s place was fabulous. It is in a great location...you can walk into town and is only a short drive to many local wineries and other towns. Everything you need for an enjoyable comfortable stay is there. Melissa has local knowledge of the area and provides many little extras that made our stay wonderful.
43047801,703436487,2020-10-24,4759745,Kelli,"Mel’s place is amazing!! Such a lovely house in a great location. Mel was very quick with communication, and left a great selection of information about Angaston and the Barossa. I highly recommend you stay here!"
43047801,705591655,2020-11-01,25181424,Jess,"Thinking about staying here? DO IT! 
We were so impressed with the communication - especially given I am a bit crappy with communication, missing emails and texts (I'm the person who never knows where my phone is!). 
Mel even made sure the heating was on for our arrival and there were so many lovely touches like local bread, treats and wine which just made my day on arrival. 
The facilities are top notch and Mel has though of all the little things. 
We would so happily come back next time we are in the Barossa - great value and great location!"
43047801,707294964,2020-11-08,87680914,Austin,"The Perfect location from

Melissa was also very responsive and thoughtful about the public health environment. She was a fabulous host and we strongly recommend her place."
43047801,711380321,2020-11-25,21027588,Verity,"This cottage was immaculately presented and really comfortable. It was well-located with an easy walk up the main street  to the local cafes, shops, playgrounds and walking trails. Angaston is such a pretty town and close to other Barossa townships."
43047801,713583993,2020-12-05,6681952,Margaret,"If you're looking for a 'home away from home' while in the Barossa, Mel's place is IT! From the quality of fittings and stylish layout to the wonderful welcome pack and information on local Angaston and Barossa attractions and activities, Mel's place had it all. It is a gorgeously renovated cottage with sparkling new bathroom and laundry, quality kitchen fittings and very comfortable beds. Mel ensured it was spotlessly clean - including extra foil in the Smeg oven to catch any drips. The house was as depicted in the photos but with much more outdoor space to which photos just don't do justice.  Sitting in either of the covered outdoor areas with views across to the sheep and alpacas grazing on the hill while listening to the cockatoos and parrots in the creek-side gum trees made us feel as if we were a million miles away - but in fact, it was only a short walk up into the main part of Angaston where there is something for everyone. Being central to many wineries, taking a taxi was easy too. There were no 'downsides' to staying at Mel's place! Easy to find, great location, excellent communication - highly recommended."
43047801,717279771,2020-12-21,380249523,Thomas,"A lovely stay for a relaxing trip in the Barossa. The house is exceedingly comfortable and pretty, and Melissa was kind all the way through."
43047801,718548437,2020-12-26,166250351,Lucy,Absolutely awesome place to stay. The house is stunning and instantly put me in holiday mode. Felt like a home away from home and I really enjoyed being able to cook up a storm in the great kitchen. Would definitely recommend staying for a decent period of time to explore the area. Thanks Mel ☺️
43047801,722074967,2021-01-05,56796292,Melissa,"A wonderful stay to disconnect from city daily grind. Loved the kitchen facilities, kitchenware and extra touches in pantry; we cooked a lots of meals (due to allergies) during our stay and almost used everything at least once. Lovely new appliances with Miele dishwasher and Smeg stovetop/oven and mattresses were comfortable with some feather pillows. Mel was able to accommodate a late check out request which made us and the kids so happy. A short walk to playgrounds and shops which was amazing. Loved the space of the backyard and views of the hill with animals. Recommendations and tips by Mel in the book was very helpful and yes Kiel’s have SPECTACULAR coffee! Many thanks for your great communication and being a great host Mel. Hope to stay again in the near future."
43047801,722903129,2021-01-08,45694465,Megan,We really enjoyed our stay. The photos represented the place very well and the kitchen was particularly well outfitted. The property was very clean and well kept. Loved the outdoor area and view.
43047801,724705782,2021-01-16,378067471,Simon,"If you are looking for a property in Angaston - or the Barossa Valley in general - look no further. We have stayed in a number of Airbnb's around the Barossa and Mel's is the best we have found. Welcoming, clean, stylish, well stocked; it is pretty much everything you want in an Airbnb. Mel's communication was outstanding and she even left local wine and sourdough bread for our arrival. It is a 5 min walk to all the restaurants in Angaston and an easy drive everywhere else. Perfect for families or couples.
Mel is the definition of a superhost!"
43047801,736870077,2021-03-06,14919880,Judith,"Mel's place was a wonderful place to stay at. The house was sparkling clean and extremely well appointed. We loved the outside area, which provided a fabulous playground for our 2 young children. The property is fully fenced so we didn't need to worry about our kids running out onto the street. Mel provided some little extras, that made us feel very special, including fresh bread, fruit, coffee, etc. The beds were super comfortable and we ended up sleeping better and for longer than we do at home ;). We would be back in  heartbeat!"
43047801,738724393,2021-03-13,25048908,Melissa,"Beautiful place to stay in the Barossa. Melissa has thought of everything, and it’s an incredibly homely place to stay. Loved the bottle of wine and treats to help us settle in on arrival. Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend."

43118837,712087856,2020-11-29,233600734,Shannon,Great location. Just a short taxi to The Louise for a great dinner and close to some excellent wineries for tasting. Walking distance to Fino for lunch. Wonderful goodie basket on our arrival with terrific breakfast provisions. Dolce Gusto coffee machines with some pods provided.

43329785,707273721,2020-11-07,148847086,Matty,"Annika has a well presented accomodation situated on the beautiful Cirillo estate. The place is well positioned being five minutes out of Nuriootpa and a stones throw from the sights and tastes of the wider Barossa region.

The house is spacious, clean and well stocked with all the amenities you could need.

We made the most of the warm afternoons and spent time relaxing on the outdoor deck, withdrawing into the house with the onset of cooler night and retiring by the fire.

This place effectively had everything we needed and more."

The guest house was amazing, set within a great location of the vineyards on their property. They supplied breakfast and snacks which was fantastic and even a cake for my girlfriends birthday which was a nice touch. Marco hosted a wine tasting which was brilliant and made the day! (His wine is )

Thanks again and hopefully one day we can come back!

Craig, Donna, Ryan and Jessie"
43329785,731412155,2021-02-14,233715014,Stefan,"Truly the perfect Barossa Airbnb; absolutely exemplary in every aspect. The house is modern and stylish, light-filled and airy by day, snug and cosy by night, and positively teeming with supplies, amenities, and a bespoke selection of goodies that raised the bar for thoughtful hospitality and attention to detail. Its location strikes an ideal balance, with easy proximity to many iconic Barossa treasures and yet just removed enough from the town centres and arterial roads to ensure a serene and secluded escape. We’re also so grateful for the superb private Cirillo tasting with Marco — an absolute must for lovers of wine without the wank(!), it perfectly encapsulated the Cirillo experience: welcoming, generous, understated, deliberate, and the quality speaks for itself. Wholeheartedly recommend, and will certainly return! Huge thanks to Annika and Marco."

The space is so large and open too!
The location is beautiful and serene, and only 20 minutes drive from Tanunda, and only 5 or 10 minutes from the start of the wineries. It is so conveniently close to Gawler too, so we were able to pop in and grab some bits and pieces and make the most of the kitchen.

Greg and Mary's hospitality was amazing, and Greg truly went out of his way to help us with some left behind items.

The cottage itself was perfect for myself and my wife and had everything we could've asked for and more. It was clean and it has clearly been well kept. Debra was quick to respond to queries and provided us with local information that would cater to all age groups. We were also provided with breakfast which was a lovely touch. If anyone ever wants to stay within the Angaston area or surrounds, I would highly recommend staying at Debra's cottage."

44282424,671757287,2020-10-05,90855816,Felicity,"Debra’s cottage is so perfect for a relaxing stay in the Barossa. The bedroom is modern and stylish with a very comfortable bed overlooking the TV. There is a sparkling clean bathroom with a spacious shower. The kitchen is so well equipped with everything you need to prepare your own food, plus an awesome selection of teas. The air conditioner is very powerful and the cottage also includes a heated blanket and heated towel rack too. 

The location is ideal as it situated centrally to Angaston, Nuriootpa and Tanunda and we discovered that quite a few of the takeaway places in these towns will deliver to the cottage. It’s also very close to one of the major walking/bike trails too. The cottage is surrounded by beautiful gardens with vineyards all around. 

We absolutely loved staying here and will be back again in the future!"
44282424,703452069,2020-10-25,41871780,Jason And Louise,"We stayed at Debra’s cottage for two nights while we explored a tiny bit of the region. It’s a cosy, private, peaceful and clean cottage situated amongst the vineyards on Angaston Road. We thought it was going to be a bit out if the way, but not at all!! We walked to Atze’s Corner for tastings, to Vintner’s Bar and Grill for a superb dinner and could very easily catch taxis further a field. Debra had gone to a lit of trouble to make sure her cottage was well stocked and very comfortable. We highly recommend a stay here for a cosy, charming and good value getaway in the Barossa."

Rebecca's house is beautifully styled in all its furnishings, and immaculately clean. Such thoughtful touches throughout with fresh lavender and plants (I loved the potted olive tree in the dining area - I bought one at the Barossa nursery myself for home!). Great goodies provided, Barossa locally made bread and milk & breakfast essentials for breakfast! The outdoor area was gorgeous with a nice sized yard and beautifully clean pool, would love to come again in summer one time to use the pool. We did have a quick dip on the warmer day we were there and my son loved the floaty llama! Great for kids, puzzles, books, toys/blocks and a piano for them (and adults!) to play on. It is great as it has a bath too as well as seperate shower for families. Inside, the kitchen has absolutely everything you need and is very well designed with brand new appliances. Linen and bath towels were all very lush. Budburst House was a stylish home away from home, has everything you need as a family and close to all Tanunda shops. Thank you for being such a wonderful host Rebecca, we were very happy in choosing your lovely b&b for our getaway!!"

The little touches she put in (e.g. a little welcome note with some snacks and breakfast prepared for us, though it might look small, we really appreciated it as it saves us time to head to supermarket). Everything used in the house is of quality too. We absolutely enjoyed our stay. Communication with Rebecca was easy and quick.  We cannot fault a thing from our stay. There are 5 star hotels, and the Budburst House is definitely a 5 star airbnb. Highly recommended!"

The kitchen had absolutely everything we needed to cook up a storm.. we loved the premium quality knives and cookware and the huge island bench!  The spacious, open plan living with gorgeous raked ceilings has such a great vibe. The undercover outdoor area complete with bbq is great, but the highlight is definitely the sparkling clean pool.

We were about 10-15 mins from all the wineries that we visited. 2 min walk to the main street in Tanunda. Her place was very well equipped with everything we needed. She had a small brochure with recommendations which helped us with organising a Barossa taxi to take us from point to point! We really enjoyed our time staying at Di's place.

45855752,723802517,2021-01-12,234149640,Kate,"Our family of four with two young children (3 & 1), felt very much at home in this beautiful house. The location is walking distance to all that the main street offers, rooms are generous sizes, amenities to suit families, couples and business travellers. Dianne (host) was very responsive to messages - I highly recommend this house!"
45855752,724268434,2021-01-14,10220030,Michele,"Maggie's Place is very new, tastefully furnished and sparkling clean. There are lots of thoughtful touches, including the contents of the pantry and the welcome basket. We loved having 2 bathrooms, both with quality products (barsoap , organic shampoo & the luxurious Sheridan towels!) - & we appreciated having a kitchen handtowel, too - so rare these days. 
The location of Maggie's Place is excellent for exploring the town of Tanunda on foot -just a few minutes walk to all the shops & cafes - and for exploring the whole Barossa Valley by car (or by The Wine Wagon, as we did)."
45855752,724713652,2021-01-16,74370375,Dave,We had a wonderfully relaxing weekend in this lovely house. Central to all the action. Easy to driving around the Barossa wineries from throughout the day then park the car and walk along Tanunda main road for dinner and cosy drinks. Excellent . Thankyou Dianne for hosting us with special touches. Dave & Annemarie
45855752,726718064,2021-01-25,105668565,Elliot,Dianne was a good communicator and her place is in a great location.
45855752,737428731,2021-03-07,66536164,Graham,Great place in an outstanding location - just a block from the main street. Fantastic hospitality with quick communication. I'd definitely stay here again.
45855752,738722480,2021-03-13,293038898,Sue,"Fresh modern place with great amenities, location, bedding & kitchen.
Communication prompt, enquiries answered & helpful local advice given.
Happy to return "
45978778,718991175,2020-12-28,197270273,Ashley,"very well presented home with a lot of character, very quite and suite a family. Great location well worth the stay"
45978778,720250668,2020-12-31,93437900,Chris,Beautiful house. Han was very responsive. Breakfast was provided which was lovely.
45978778,735564449,2021-02-28,144260445,Bianca,"Dori's cottage was gorgeous. The location was excellent- a few steps from the Burge Family winery, a stone's throw from Lyndoch. A short drive to Tanunda, Gawler and an abundance of wineries. the provided breakfast was amazing, especially as we hadn't considered that supermarkets close earlier than we are used to."
45978778,737678390,2021-03-08,80181426,Georgina,If you want a true taste of living amongst the vines this is it- large homestead with big verandas - a little run down but charming- old orchards of pears and fig trees attract beautiful birds to the area - enjoy sitting out on the big veranda drinking a glass of local vino accompanied by cheese and local produce- taking in the views
47117855,721802792,2021-01-03,127334598,Darren,"Wonderful location and home to spend our first adventure in the Barossa. Walking distance to Angaston and a short drive to many great wineries and restaurants. Lovely cottage with contemporary amenities, which along with Adele's handwritten welcome note all made for a tranquil and enjoyable stay in the Barossa Valley."
47117855,723176657,2021-01-10,23882086,Sam,We absolutely loved Adele’s place. It is perfectly located - walking distance to town. It was a beautiful space that is comfortable and clean. I would not hesitate staying here again! (I almost want to keep it a secret!) Highly recommend! Thanks Adele!
47117855,724730387,2021-01-17,10087972,Hannah,Plum Cottage is a great find! Location was ideal and lovely and comfortable place to stay for a few nights. Would love to return one day!
47117855,726703915,2021-01-24,23800778,Cathlyn,"It was hard to find a fault with Adele's cottage. It is located barely 5 minutes walk from the town centre and within very close driving distance to so many wineries, breweries and distilleries. The photos do not do place justice. There is an amazing view from the backyard over Angaston which you can either enjoy in the backyard or from the comfort of the enclosed verandah. You will not find a shortage of places to eat at or things to do when you're here."
47117855,727813121,2021-01-31,156739505,Sam,Great property within walking distance to the Main Street and a short drive to hundreds of wineries. Perfect spot to stay whilst exploring Barossa
47117855,729770738,2021-02-07,109385881,Gaurav,We had a relaxing time in this beautiful country cottage. Thx Adele for your hospitality
47117855,730893609,2021-02-13,167870549,Ezray,"Lovely, quiet and peaceful stay. Amazing place to spend a weekend!"
47133437,722279712,2021-01-06,381025994,Jay,"We did 2 weeks of covid isolation at the cottage and Aloe couldn't have been more helpful. From delivering us homegrown eggs and mulberries to doing a shop for us and extending our stay. She regularly checked in to see if we needed anything or to help us out any way she could. The property is great with a beautiful garden area, Jacuzzi and well equipped kitchen. Another positive is the beds were super comfortable and having a washing machine and drier really helped out! Great spot in the barossa close to wineries and other attractions. Thanks so much to Aloe our iso hero!"
47133437,722892686,2021-01-08,93064918,Babita,It was a really nice place to stay with family.
47133437,723155302,2021-01-09,164927990,Tracey,"A quaint, eclectic little place. Everything you need for a barossa break as it is so handy to everything. The wine cellar was well used as the weather was very hot during our stay."
47133437,726276191,2021-01-23,243058005,Joedan,"Well worth the stay, jacuzzi was incredible and I would definitely stay here again."
47133437,728303255,2021-02-01,37207022,Rebecca,"This beautiful cottage has everything you could need! Set in a wonderful location, clean, well thought out, quirky and stylish! Loved the jacuzzi hut and garden especially"
47133437,729122554,2021-02-05,39616433,Manon,We had a great time during our stay at Aloe’s place. It was very quirky and interesting accommodation. Lovely jacuzzi in a beautiful garden at the front. Also super convenient to walk into cafe/restaurants in Barossa and easy parking! Would recommend!
47133437,736875644,2021-03-06,96519632,Mark,"Very quirky character cottage with the comfiest beds!  

Perfectly situated cottage in central Tanunda.  

Character dining room /wine cellar  is very intriguing and caused much chatter amongst our party."
47164084,737427477,2021-03-07,280607486,Marie,"This accommodation is so very perfect for a large family, so much so that we would like to stay there again sometime when international travel recommences and we can have ALL of our family together. 
There are 4 sitting areas and 2 dining areas inside, and spacious bedrooms, allowing for any amount of privacy for anybody who wanted it (children escaping from adults and vice-versa). When downstairs it's impossible to hear anybody upstairs, and even between rooms the sound-proofing is amazing.  One sitting area & the main dining room were large enough for everybody to congregate, and the kitchen was very well-equipped and large enough for many cooks to work together. 
The outside deck, sitting areas and barbecue spot overlooked the orchard and a vineyard, and we were encouraged to pick and eat as much fruit as we wanted, and also to help ourselves to any vegetables that were growing. The lawn areas were great for playing or relaxing on, and with no near neighbours, we could be as noisy as we wanted. 
The house has many doors and windows, allowing for flow-through fresh air, so whether we were inside or outdoors, we could always hear the birds chatting in the massive gum trees. 
I felt that the only possible improvement would be a swimming pool or tennis court. However it was all so perfect that we only went out for a few hours during the days, and at night nobody wanted to eat out; we all stayed home and cooked up our own banquets. We certainly appreciated the gift of some wines. 
This is a very homely, comfortable accommodation displaying history and character, and very perfect for families or groups of couples."
47298269,737409997,2021-03-07,79793975,Emily,"A great location, close to local wineries. Aloe gave really clear directions to find the property (off of dirt roads) to make it easy to find. We received fast responses to any questions we had. Would definitely stay here again."
47322117,723179397,2021-01-10,185831847,Dep,Very spacious house and lovely location overlooking the vineyards. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning here again.
47596521,724709194,2021-01-16,270197468,Harrison,Aloe’s house was perfect for a very spontaneous stay for our group of 6 with so many entertaining features including the tennis court many outdoor seating options. Thank you for having us!!
47596521,729124346,2021-02-05,69158367,Justus,Great location. 
47596521,729320539,2021-02-06,161749736,Guangan,"Great experience, excellent service, strongly recommend!"
47596521,735569168,2021-03-01,107497767,Brooke,Beautiful location close to wineries and has excellent space for large groups
47596521,738723152,2021-03-13,99187772,Ben,Great location and the house had everything we needed for a great weekend away!
47987559,730429083,2021-02-11,139902513,Alice,"This place is beautiful, the house is so clean and the view is amazing. Aloe is a great host and made us feel really welcome. This is the perfect place to relax, I highly recommend staying here "
47987559,735843153,2021-03-01,281377978,Marina,"Absolutely wonderful landscape, amazing place to explore, lots of kangaroos and beautiful old gum trees. The roads are super quiet too, and great for a walk or a jog, and Aloe’s property is also great fun to explore. The granny flat was a lovely, tidy little space, with a comfy bed and a small but very functional kitchen and bathroom. I loved the little patio area out front too - perfect spot for a cuppa. I recommend this stay very highly as a place to self-quarantine, as you can enjoy the granny flat and get as much fresh air as you like, plus socialise with the chooks, all without leaving the property."
47987559,739776902,2021-03-17,171196703,Rachel,"This place is surrounded by a nice landscape. However you cannot watch the landscape at night so it would have been nice to have a small TV. It is a very hard place to find so if you have bad phone reception, you will have to have an exact map of how to find it previous to heading out there. I’m with Telstra and I struggled. 
We had just worked all day and wanted to find our accommodation and put our feet up with a cup of tea however there was no kettle and no regular teabags. A little bit disappointing on the service and considering the place is quite a way out it would be a nice gesture to perhaps have bread and butter in the fridge. And watch out for the redbacks!!"
48307556,737422287,2021-03-07,310327267,Emily,Lovely quiet and comfortable abode
48307556,738773420,2021-03-14,83420622,Josh,"Thanks for having us! The unit was clean, comfortable and in a great spot close to everything in Tanunda."
48367802,736901792,2021-03-07,21673519,Lafayette,"We loved our stay and the generous hospitality at Little Eden. 
The cottage is beautiful, charming and relaxing. 
Watching the sun rise in the garden was a beautiful start to the day and staying here was a lovely experience."
48367802,737844338,2021-03-09,106841730,Anne,We really enjoyed our stay at Mike’s place. We travelled with our dog and it worked well for her. It was also in a great location to visit the Barossa Valley. We would stay again!
48367802,738746729,2021-03-13,148190539,Peter,Cute cottage in a nice little town.
