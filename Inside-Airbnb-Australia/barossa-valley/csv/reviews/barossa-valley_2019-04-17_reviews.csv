1125097,10081118,2014-01-29,1898281,Rus,"Great host and amazing accommodation!  

We went to celebrate Lizzy's 30th and the Coach House could not have been more perfect.

Flying into Adelaide, we stopped at the Central Market downtown and stocked up on supplies for the weekend.  After an leisurely hour and a bit drive we arrived at Strathlyn BNB where we were met by Heather. 

She took us to the Coach House on the back of the property and it couldnt have been nicer.

Great view out of the top level balcony overlooking the vineyard. 

A/C and fans proved to be invaluable on a 38 degree weekend!

All amenities are better than expected and all you could want.

This place is a short walk (5 mins) to Saltrams and a 20 min walk to the farmers market on Saturday morning.  

We hired bikes (had them delivered and picked up) and made an easy 25 km loop to quite a few wineries and Maggie Beer's Farm Shop.  There is a great bike path that starts in Angaston and goes into the heart of the Barossa.

1125097,10335170,2014-02-14,2725224,Teresa,"A lovely and convenient location, surrounded by grapes!  Far away enough from the main house to have as much privacy as you need.  Breakfast is included - eggs, bacon, juice and a bottle of wine.  If you are keen to cook some of the amazing local produce, there is an electric hot plate and microwave, but no oven.  Aircon works well.  "
1125097,10881952,2014-03-11,8982612,Kathy,A wonderful experience from start to finish . We will be back . Amazing location . Beautiful cottage . Immaculate attention to detail that made our stay just perfect . 
1125097,11872081,2014-04-17,10977428,Phillip,The coach house is in a lovely location. We were fortunate enough to be there watch the sun set to the west just as the moon came up over the vineyard to the west. The accommodation is clean and generously appointed. Recommended.
1125097,13189669,2014-05-21,1304769,Lilia,What a great place to stay in Barossa! Luxury private coach house overlooking a vineyard. We enjoyed watching the sunrise and the sunset from the deck. The host was very friendly and helpful.
1125097,14372675,2014-06-17,16453786,Bianca,We had a lovely weekend at Strathlyn Coach House. Heather was a fantastic host. She made us feel very welcome and made fantastic recommendations for our weekend in the Barossa. The Coach House was gorgeous - beautiful views & everything you'd possibly need. The location was great - very close to Angaston & still very private. We'd certainly stay here again.     
1125097,16560082,2014-07-29,1122028,Natasha,"Heather made us feel extremely welcome by telling us a little about the house, and with a bottle of wine and a packed fridge! She's very personably and willing to answer all questions. 
The location couldn't be more picturesque and made me so happy to have wine and cheese on the veranda which had uninterrupted views of the vineyard, with not a house in sight. 
We would definitely recommend to anyway thinking about staying. "
1125097,19676815,2014-09-16,76497,Chris,"A hidden gem, nestled in the vines between Angaston and Nuriootpa. So quiet and peaceful – I'd highly recommend this to anyone staying for a few days in the Barossa."
1125097,20504718,2014-09-30,20096212,Natalie,The coach house is set in a beautiful location and is conveniently located for exploring the Barossa. Heather was warm and welcoming and had stocked the fridge providing a delicious breakfast spread for us to enjoy at our leisure each morning. The house is well maintained and furnished comfortably. But best of all you can grab a glass of wine and sit on the upstairs balcony while enjoying the sunset and views over the vineyards. Highly recommended.  
1125097,21393629,2014-10-16,9457572,Mark,"The Coach House was very cosy and well appointed in a beautiful setting. Just what we were looking for. Heather made us feel very welcome, was able to answer all our questions regarding the area and gave us some fabulous suggestions regarding wineries, coffee and dining throughout the Barossa and even McLaren Vale."
1125097,22204359,2014-11-01,10624389,Cindy,Lovely stay at the Strathlyn Coach House.  Beautifully situated and conveniently located - we found it to be a great home base for us to explore the Barossa and Eden Valley regions!

1125097,23753581,2014-12-09,13683732,Renee,"Strathlyn was a great place to stay for a weekend away. Heather was really quick to respond and was very easy to contact on arrival etc. the studio was lovely with an amazing little balcony overlooking the vines, and in an easy position for sightseeing around the area. All was as expected from the listing! Would definitely recommend it to others. "
1125097,24020179,2014-12-17,16955023,David,A wonderful secluded place in the middle of a vineyard. The cottage was well stocked with breakfast goodies. Information on site was helpful. 
1125097,28774257,2015-03-30,21199797,Penelope,"We had a lovely stay at the Coach House which is a beautifully restored building. It was very comfortable and private, set on the edge of a vineyard. Heather the host was very helpful, there is so much to see and do in the area, great vineyards, cafés, restaurants and on a Saturday the Barossa Farmers Market is just down the road. We would definitely recommend staying at the Coach House!"
1125097,31734308,2015-05-09,26976969,Melissa,"We spent three nights at the coach house. Location was excellent, with nice views from the balcony.  The weather was blustery and cold at times, but there are two heaters provided in addition to the bedroom unit. Kitchen was stocked to make a nice breakfast and simple dinners. "
1125097,35211602,2015-06-16,25014261,Garry,"Our stay at The Coach house was delightful. Heather was friendly and helpful when it came to local info on where to go and what to do. I would recommend staying at Strathlyn yo anyone travelling to the Barossa, it's central and easy to get around to entire district. "

1125097,37380726,2015-07-06,34329031,Leonie,"Heather was very friendly on our arrival and made us feel welcome at the Strathlyn Estate. 
Everything that describes the Strathlyn Coach House on Airbnb is exactly what you get. The bed on mezzanine level was so comfortable with the sun shining through the door to the balcony each morning. You can't ask for anything more with views all round the Coach House. The bacon and eggs which were obviously from local produce were very fresh and yummy.
The Coach House is very private from the main house and has its on driveway so that you can come and go without feeling that you are opposing on the hosts.  
The Barossa Farmers Market is only a short walk from the Coach House and wow the homemade Beef & Red Wine pies and the fruit tarts were amazing.
If you need a relaxing and no fuss weekend or few days away this is the place to stay."
1125097,37899195,2015-07-11,20987637,Troy,We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn house in the Barossa. When we arrived there was a beautiful bottle of wine and breakfast provisions on hand. The accommodation was perfect for our short stay in the Valley. Its perfectly located between the main towns of the Barossa.
1125097,40978732,2015-08-03,33969993,Shara,"We LOVED our stay at Strathlyn coach house, it was such a quaint little stone cottage set in an idyllic setting, surrounded by vines and fruit trees. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect place to stay. And to top it all off Heather was a friendly and welcoming host. Cottage was well stocked and had everything we needed, great location also! Close to all the wineries. Will stay again :) "
1125097,45378530,2015-09-02,6576334,Duane,"We had a wonderful stay at Strathlyn coach house.  Heather made us feel very welcome and gave us some good insights to local places to visit.

She also provided plenty of cereal, eggs, bacon, bread and milk for breakfast.  It is right next door to Saltram winery and she also left us a bottle of their wine which we enjoyed.

It is a beautiful location nestled in amongst the vines and has a good view of the surrounding area.  The cottage is very private but only a minute walk to the main house.

The Barossa Valley is quite compact and it is an easy drive to most of the wineries.  Angaston is only a minute drive away and Nuriootpa is only about 5 minutes drive.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
1125097,46889500,2015-09-14,12560317,Natalie,"Heather was a wonderful host. She was very flexible in regards to our check-in time which was very kind. Heather was also very helpful in providing advice on where to visit in the area and things to do. The accommodation is beautiful and very peaceful, with a generous stock of food for breakfast. We used the gym during our stay, the facilities in the gym were perfect for what we needed. 

I would highly recommend Heather as a host, and we hope to stay again next time we are visiting the Barossa."

1125097,50177730,2015-10-10,41666843,Hamish,Heather was an absolutely amazing host! Would highly recommend this for accomodation in the Barossa! All the information you need to navigate your way through the wineries is neatly arranged for you by Heather. Breakfast was provided and Heather was always helpful when we needed help on where to head in the valley. An incredibly central location and picturesque surrounds. We were absolutely amazed at how secluded we were yet still so close to everything. Will definitely be back again! Thanks again heather! 
1125097,51364168,2015-10-19,45858541,John,Heather was very friendly welcoming and helpful.  The Coach house is lovely and the setting is peaceful and relaxing. Loved breakfast on te balcony at the back overlooking the vineyards.  It is within walking distance of Saltram's winery and a slightly longer walk or very short drive to the Barossa Farmers Market.
1125097,52206756,2015-10-27,34543599,Teresa,"Very comfortable, clean and quiet cottage. Most enjoyable stay at a delightful property. Very private with lovely views.

1125097,54110068,2015-11-16,37655181,Lara,"Heather was very welcoming and had stocked the house with everything we needed for an enjoyable stay. 

The coach house was as pretty in real life as it is in all the pictures and the perfect place for a romantic weekend away for two. We had a lovely afternoon sitting on the balcony overlooking the vineyards with some cheese and wine bought nearby. 

There was also a new laundry and gym which unfortunately we didn't have time to use but would definitely be useful if you were planning a longer stay. "
1125097,55975423,2015-12-07,10646560,Hayley,Beautiful converted barn in a stunning setting. Fab wine tasting venue next door and fantastic restaurant down the road in walking distance. We had a lovely time. Heather is very helpful and the barn has everything you could possibly need for a romantic break in the Barossa. The little extras Heather left help you get started and relax you into the break. Thank you.
1125097,56841927,2015-12-19,7769196,Gill,We had a great time at Heathers coach house. Great location and everything you need to explore this fabulous region. Heather was very friendly and gave us good eating tips. A private and beautiful place. 
1125097,57362528,2015-12-25,26235245,Julie,"What a fabulous location for guests spending time in the Barossa Valley.   The coach house was unique, quaint and private but still so close to Angaston for restaurants ect.  Heather provided supplies for a bacon and egg breakfast and a lovely bottle of wine.  We enjoyed having a drink on the rear balcony overlooking the Vineyard.  Recommend the coach house for a stay with a touch of history. Very enjoyable, thank you Heather."
1125097,58938449,2016-01-05,2975981,Kyle,"Great accommodation in the heart of the Barossa.

The coach house is tucked around the back so we felt like we had plenty of privacy. Inside it was clean and comfortable.

Angaston is a cute little town with a small grocery store and some yummy places to eat."
1125097,60378905,2016-01-23,10463054,Kate,Heather is a very welcoming and generous host. Very knowledgeable and accommodating. We had a wonderful stay at the Coach House. Great location.
1125097,61490586,2016-02-05,52824036,Michael,"We had a great stay at Strathlyn Coach House in February 2016.
The accommodation was neat, tidy and comfortable, Heather made us feel very welcome and was flawless organised.
This is a great spot to stay if you'd like to be near plenty of local wineries, but not in the heart of Tanunda/Barossa; but have very peaceful and secluded nights.
The view was outstanding, surrounding pleasants and overall was a great find for us."
1125097,62571412,2016-02-15,6920494,Maria,"The Coach house has kept all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. 

Heather stocked the fridge with lots of breakfast goodies including bacon, eggs, bread, milk, oj and even a bottle of moscato!

The deck out the back gives a panoramic view of vineyards and was perfect for star gazing and watching the sunrise!

Thank you for your hospitality and sharing your charming cottage with us!"
1125097,64934831,2016-03-09,9474833,Rand,We had a fantastic time in the Barossa and from the get go we felt welcome and at home at Strathlyn. It was very very hot when we arrived and Heather had made sure to cool the coach house down by putting on the aircon earlier. These kinds of thoughtful touches sum up the experience. Situated amongst the vineyards this is a wonderful place to stay in the region.
1125097,66349987,2016-03-22,37121832,Ian,"We really had the most fabulous short break in the Barossa.  Thanks to Heather's suggestions, we got to enjoy the scrumptious fresh produce at the Farmers market, great food and service at Vintner's and Wanera.  We tasted some great wines and met some really friendly and knowledgeable staff at Taste Eden Valley, Turkey Flat, Rockford's, MSV and TeAro.  A highlight was staying in the Coach house @ Strathlyn surrounded by Saltram's vineyards and enjoying a glass or two on the rear deck watching the sun go down or a morning cuppa watching the hot air balloons meander around the valley.  Heather was the perfect host and has added her personal touch to make your stay even more enjoyable.  It was only 4 days but we left feeling relaxed and re-charged!!!  We highly recommend Strathlyn as a great base for a real Barossa experience."
1125097,68506417,2016-04-05,18611402,Lanny,The coach house was very homely and had everything we needed for our two night stay. Heather was very welcoming and even had breakfast for us!

1125097,77207376,2016-05-30,31717142,Elizabeth And Peter,"The Strathlyn Coach House was as cute and comfortable as described.

The property perfectly matched the description and was really lovely. The view of the vineyard from the balcony in the morning was wonderful! This is the perfect location in the Barossa as it's close to everything but secluded.
1125097,78975989,2016-06-10,53997653,Dan,A truly beautiful cottage set amongst the vines - a spectacular and unique experience.

1125097,79798120,2016-06-14,10029038,David,"Heather was very helpful in showing us the lovely converted coach house and even had the heating on for us. Generous cooked brekky supplies were included as was an excellent bottle of red, Pepperjack one of our favs! They even have a Nespresso machine. This unique location overlooks the vineyard directly with its own balcony. It's also located minutes away from Salters (who make Pepperjack) & Vintners restaurants; we dined at both and they were excellent.. particularly the award winning Vintners. Here's some photos of this wonderful property & surrounds. (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1125097,86898919,2016-07-18,73709119,Bridget,"We had a lovely stay at the Strathlyn Coach House. Very scenic views of the vineyards directly from the balcony attached to the bedroom.

1125097,102943582,2016-09-19,84798428,Matt,"Thank you Heather for making us feel so welcome and comfortable during our stay. The coach house was exactly like we imagined and the pictures and description don't do it justice, it was warm and cosy and the views are outstanding. It's very private and secluded away from main dwelling, perfect for a romantic getaway for a few nights but also accommodating for a long stay. We had such a lovely time here, it will stay with us forever! Thanks"

1125097,114937262,2016-11-20,83888401,Alan,"We had a fantastic stay at the coach house. It was a gorgeous setting, nestled in rolling hills of vineyards and beautifully kept gardens surrounding the property. The coach house was clean, spacious and nicely furnished. The newly renovated balcony overlooking the vineyards was perfect for enjoying the complimentary local Riesling. The location was great for tripping around the Barossa Valley. We hired bikes one day and cycled some of the new bike trail, highly recommended. 
Thanks again Heather for being a wonderful host."

1125097,136646949,2017-03-11,50436829,Samuel,"An absolutely fantastic air bnb in an absolutely sensational location. Hands down the most incredible experience I have had. The place was cosy and romantic, had a little bit of history and was perfect to come back to after a day on the wineries! The only thing better than this air bnb is Heather herself, who has made (and continues to make for the entirety of your stay) an incredible effort to make your time a memorable one. Five stars does not do this place justice and I will be staying here whenever I return to the Barossa (as long as it isnt booked out!)"
1125097,138077116,2017-03-18,49906487,Chuck,We had a lovely stay here during March. Was great to have some quiet time on beautiful surrounds.

1125097,203887009,2017-10-15,153059432,Raymond,The coach house was everything we needed on our 2 day trip to the Barossa Valley. It was secluded yet reasonable driving distance to all the places we wanted to visit. Heather was a 5/5 house.
1125097,206737793,2017-10-26,34949341,Roberta,"The Coach House is very well positioned for exploring the delights of the Barossa.  It is very quiet and peaceful and the deck off the bedroom is lovely for a cuppa or glass of wine while admiring the view, including a kangaroo and her joey during our stay.
Heather is very helpful and the taxi company she recommended were great.  They took us to restaurants for dinner and were a mine of information.
The downstairs area of the Coach House is quite small although the bedroom is large and airy.  It's an old stone building that was renovated about 20+ years ago set in lovely gardens that are quiet and private."

Quaint cottage with awesome view over the vineyards. Very close to Angaston, which is a lovely town to explore. ""Country breakfast"" provisions were delicious and very thoughtful."

1125097,271973914,2018-06-02,48133639,Eugene,"Exactly the type of place you wish for when thinking of a weekend in a wine region. The place is private and quiet with beautiful views directly over a local vineyard. A converted coach house with a loft bedroom, it is just the right size for 2 people.

Heather was a lovely host who ran us through the local attractions, and provided us with some breakfast ingredients, wine and other essentials!"
1125097,275390380,2018-06-11,192626455,Madi,Great location and home  for a weekend getaway.
1125097,287219884,2018-07-08,57077026,Natalia,Thank you to Heather for being an amazing host. Our accommodation was so cozy and was perfect for a winter retreat! After our outings to the wineries in the Barossa Valley we were always excited to return to the coach house.
1125097,313703722,2018-08-26,5543656,Mark,"Amazing property, beautiful views and everything you need (including local kangaroos)."
1125097,323566717,2018-09-16,41033800,Emily,A beautiful place in the heart of the Barossa! The beautiful outdoor area with views across the vines was to die for. Highly recommend to others - we have the most perfect stay. Thank you!
1125097,325854906,2018-09-21,27335138,Karen,"A great place to rest and unwind. Perfectly set in the vines of the Barossa. Heather was a great host with lots of information on the area, plus great provisions for breakfasts. Highly recommend this cottage."
1125097,326706052,2018-09-23,213654328,Pete,"A wonderful treasure, in an amazing place creating a lovely environment which you cannot help but to enjoy"
1125097,331187203,2018-10-02,179667904,Josh,A beautiful cottage with a private balcony overlooking the wonderful grape vines. Perfect getaway for couples. Heather was an amazing host and couldn’t recommend staying here highly enough.
1125097,333095988,2018-10-06,114600514,Phoenix,"I'm glad to be in your house. Your room is very comfortable. We had a good two days.
We saw beautiful sunsets and sunrises, as well as kangaroos."
1125097,339732921,2018-10-22,22863083,Ben,"Absolutely loved the Strathlyn coach house. Check in and communication were seamless, the space was lovely and stocked with everything we could need, and the views are incredible. We loved the thoughtful touches. Would highly recommend and already looking forward to returning."
1125097,403486011,2019-01-21,21821894,Julia,Lovely location set amongst the vines and very private.
1125097,405892980,2019-01-27,51377389,James,Great place to stay with stunning views and close to everything the Barossa has to offer. Heather was lovely and gave some great tips. We will defo be back!
1125097,410202959,2019-02-09,239376120,Julia,Beautiful place and great location. Would highly recommend.
1125097,414184733,2019-02-18,3263629,Chad,"Cute cottage tucked away in a vineyard. What more could a person want? It will be difficult to forget sitting on that back porch watching the sun go down. 
Walking distance to Vitners Bar And Grill, (one of the best meals we had on our 3 week Australian vacation).
The bonus was heading out onto the deck for morning coffee and seeing a family of kangaroo (mama, pop and little Joey)20 feet from deck."
1125097,415954331,2019-02-24,214772418,Tim,Awesome weekend away !
1125097,418717075,2019-03-02,174329038,Paige,"Breathtaking views. Homely and just a very special place to relax and enjoy the wine region. Love it and was a perfect touch for my birthday. So close to everything. 
Heather thought of everything!"
1133195,20499578,2014-09-30,2941754,Suz,"Heather was brilliant, very welcoming and helpful. Her booklet inside the apartment was very helpful explaining how to do things and interesting ideas. Thanks for the bottle of wine in the fridge in addition to the great kitchen set up."
1133195,22080257,2014-10-29,22510871,Chelsea,"Lemon Tree Spa apartment was a beautiful place for a weekend away. There is a great view outside the windows of vineyards and well kept flowers. Heather has the appartment well stocked with groceries to make a good breakfast to start the day, the nepresso machine is a nice touch. Our first night was spent cracking open the complimentary wine, watching the dvds provided and scouring through the tonnes of information Heather provides about what is around. Heather even provides the bubble bath for the spa. Angaston is a lovely town with a supermarket open til 8, and is close to everything Barossa, yet far enough away to feel completely lost amongst the vineyards. You're in walking distance of Saltram Winery and Vitners Bar and Grill aswell as the town of Angaston if feeling like stretching the legs."
1133195,27775483,2015-03-11,23922905,Aidan,Heather made us feel very welcome and when we had some flight arrival changes she was more than happy to help. The property was exactly as described and I truly wish I could have stayed longer. Beautiful atmosphere and a great leaping point for adventures in the Barossa Valley.
1133195,49651331,2015-10-05,29355110,Kath,"Great location, so close to everything, the bottle of chilled wine in the fridge was a nice touch. Helpful host, very accommodating, lovely relaxing holiday, thank you!"
1133195,54727592,2015-11-23,46445701,Antony,"Great cottage to explore the barossa from, Heather was helpful and very accommodating.
Would definitely book again"
1133195,71522102,2016-04-25,63056452,Lee,"We were very happy with our stay at the Lemon Tree Spa at Strathlyn. Our host Heather was wonderful, and very helpful when we needed to make an unexpected trip home to attend to an urgent family matter, offering flexibility at the end of our stay after we were able to return. Her genuine interest and generosity was very much appreciated.
 The cottage is full of old worlde charm, comfortable and close to all the Barrosa offers, yet set in the middle of vineyards and an orchard, so very peaceful."
1133195,79750733,2016-06-14,72394166,Mitchell,"Heather was a great host, the cottage itself was perfect for a weekend away. A warm welcome with a great explanation on what to do around the area. The Lodge is very close to nearby wineries and small beautiful towns. While the house itself sits on a vinyard. Amazing weekend away, will no doubt be back again soon. "
1133195,86950935,2016-07-18,56456959,Just,"Heather made us feel very welcome and provided some really handy tips for the local area. The accommodation was clean, comfortable and had all the amenities we needed. The gardens are gorgeous! 
Thank you Heather for your beautiful accommodation. "
1133195,144942158,2017-04-16,2879875,Georg,"Heather is a fantastic host - and has a super friendly family. The lemon tree spa is a cute little house with all you need - full friedge for breakfast -  wirepool, DVD player and a selection of movies, a large garden and a well equipped gym facility! We would definitely recommend anyone to stay here. If you want even better views on the vinyarda just book heathers second accommodation. "
1133195,147122794,2017-04-25,124538850,Caryl,"Easy to find and as requested, Heather left us to our privacy for the whole three days. Lovely."
1133195,159887943,2017-06-12,3364193,Jojo,"We had such a lovely stay at Strathlyn Lemon Tree Spa! My boyfriend and I stayed for 2 nights over the long weekend. We had a bottle of wine waiting for us in the fridge along with enough bacon, eggs and bread for an epic fry up the next day. It's an absolutely gorgeous spot, really picturesque, and Heather told us a little bit about the history of the big house. The bed was large and gloriously comfortable. The spa was bubbly and luxurious! We had a wonderful time and would absolutely recommend the place to friends. Ideally located close to Angaston, it's the perfect spot from which to explore the Barossa's Cellar Doors. In fact, I've written a list of the ones we most enjoyed in case it helps anyone! (Website hidden by Airbnb)"
1133195,199421135,2017-10-01,112438406,Carolyn,"We spent three nights at the Lemon Tree Spa, and couldn't have been happier with our choice. The cottage is nestled in beautiful grounds - there were flowers blooming everywhere when we visited and the view across the adjoining vineyard is stunning. Each night we sat outside with a glass of wine in hand and watched the sun go down over the vines. Just gorgeous. The location is fantastic - about a kilometre from the historic village of Angaston, just off the main road but set back enough to be peaceful and quiet, with all the delights of the Barossa wineries close at hand. 

The cottage is fully self-contained and completely separate from the main house. And while it doesn't look fancy from the outside, don't let this fool you! Inside it's beautifully and comfortably furnished, and feels light, airy and spacious.  I've stayed in other B&Bs that are pretty and picturesque, but so cramped that you trip over the furniture all the time. None of that here - there was plenty of room to unpack our things and spread out and relax. We had everything we needed, including pots and pans and kitchen equipment if we wanted to cook, DVDs to watch and magazines and books to read. The fridge was stocked with breakfast supplies and a bottle of wine was thoughtfully provided. I particularly appreciated the little dressing table in the spa area, where I could spread out my cosmetics and 'girly stuff' without getting in the way of my partner. (It's worth noting that while the spa is in a corner of the bedroom, the bathroom itself is located separately and totally private.) 

Heather was a genuinely warm and thoughtful host. We were travelling in an open-topped vintage car that needed protection from the weather, and she kindly allowed us to use her private garage. Thanks Heather!

The only issue we had was patchy wi-fi, but apparently this is a problem with the new NBN and out of the host's control. And when the setting is so beautiful, why would you want to stare at your device? 

I loved my first trip to the beautiful Barossa, and can't wait to visit again. I won't bother to research accommodation options next time - I'll just book into the Lemon Tree confident that I'll have a wonderful experience. Very highly recommended!"
1133195,202121433,2017-10-10,151746755,Brooke,"This is such a lovely place to stay for a weekend getaway. Heather was a very lovely and welcoming host. The house is very lovely and the spa is great to relax in. It is in a good location within walking distance to a winery and close bike riding or driving distance to Nuriootpa, Tanunda and a variety of wineries around. It's surrounded by a beautiful vineyard which is lovely to go for a walk through. We will definitely be staying again :)"
1133195,206122492,2017-10-23,150479373,Karen,"Strathlyn B&B is a lovely little cottage to spend a few days at.  Very handy to lots of nice restaurants and wineries.  Thoroughly enjoyed our few days there in October 2017.

It’s a great location and we would highly recommend a guided tour to visit wineries. We thoroughly enjoyed our full day tour with Barossa valley (Website hidden by Airbnb)

1133236,12001254,2014-04-21,7388589,Justin,Thoroughly enjoyed my Barossa experience and staying at Strathlyn Spa was fantastic. Great location so close to Saltram and also the Barossa Farmers Market. Heather was gracious host and a pleasure to deal with. Thank you so much for having us there.
1133236,20694436,2014-10-04,14777600,Lee,We had a wonderful overnight stay here with Heather's caring and generous hospitality and left refreshed for the next leg of our trip. It really is just as lovely as the pictures! Strathlyn is really handy to Saltram winery and a fantastic restaurant and bar just up the road for an evening meal. And Heather's brekky really hit the spot! We hope to return again some day - thank you. 
1133236,30806619,2015-04-27,24310701,Kate,"We had the most wonderful stay at Strathlyn. Heathers hospitality, delightful breakfast, beautiful property and spot on tour and restaurant recommendations meant we had a 10/10 experience in the Barossa"

1133236,52150483,2015-10-26,2302739,Duncan,Thank you Heather for making our 30th wedding anniversary such a memorable one. We had a fantastic weekend staying in the lovely Lily Room.

1133236,255898739,2018-04-22,17740875,Chris,We absolutely loved Heathers place and wished we could have stayed longer. Such a beautiful old homestead surrounded by lovely gardens and picturesque vineyard landscape. We really enjoyed the old world charm of the room and taking pictures in the Autumn colours around the property. Heather was very easy to communicate with and also gave us some great tips on places to eat nearby. Also Heather went out of her way to locate some information that I was seeking on the history of a particular wine maker that had been in the region for a long time. The check in was a breeze and heather was very flexible with the times. We look forward to returning to heathers beautiful home in the near future. Highly recommended.

1710462,8503728,2013-11-03,5924987,Uyen,"A huge thanks to Tom and Kylie for making our trip through the barossa valley such a memorable experience. They were amazing hosts who went above and beyond our expectations. Tom, we are so grateful for your knowledge, experience and most of all your generosity in taking out the time to share that with us. This was definitely an awesome place to stay, highly recommended!"
1710462,8578734,2013-11-05,2187145,Sunni,"Kylie & Tom were thoughtful and caring hosts who made sure we had everything we needed and let us know they were nearby while leaving us to relax in peace in their quiet studio.
It's a good value bolt hole and the location is great if you're looking to tour the Barossa by car. It's lovely to be in the vines on their property. Thanks again!"
1710462,9137601,2013-12-09,724537,Alison & Jean-Philippe,"The Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed was a great base for a weekend of winery touring in the Barossa Valley. Very affordable (so you can spend more money on wine and food!), extremely comfortable, with high quality appliances and mostly Ikea furnishings. Even though we came prepared with soap and shampoo, it was all supplied, which was a lovely surprise. The setting was also lovely, set amongst the vineyards. It would be hard to get accommodation of this quality at the same price in the Barossa. Why would you stay at a dodgy, dated motor inn, when you can stay in a modern, inviting place like Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed! "
1710462,9368992,2013-12-24,10180676,Justin,"We had a great stay at the ""Shed."" It's located a little bit away from the main towns in the Barossa, but is very convenient and a perfect location for visiting the local wineries. In fact, being outside of town was a big plus for us. It has everything you'll need on site as well - we were able to enjoy a couple of relaxed nights in while cooking our own meals and enjoying local wines. A great spot for a visit to wine country. "
1710462,9465200,2013-12-30,3648835,Sitihassulaini,"We stayed for 2 night at Kylie and Tom's.  This is really an eye opener experience for us.  The location of the studio is awesome.  I love the idea of staying in the middle of grape field.  Our GPS broke down and we got lost on our way to the studio.  Tom is very helpful, he fetched us when we lost and the check in  went very smooth.  The Studio is very nice and clean. All I can say, I love everything about our stay and Barrossa Valley is very unique.  Thanks a lot to Tom & Kylie"
1710462,9543341,2014-01-02,4876046,Saa,"Lovely self sufficient studio, left with some personal touches. Great location if you want to stay a little bit away from the wineries. Would highly recommend it!"
1710462,9757596,2014-01-08,3371250,Martin,"The Studio in the Vineyard is just beautiful! Very clean, spacious and the most perfect location. I would recommend it to everybody who's going to explore the Barossa Valley!"

1710462,10065706,2014-01-28,6534569,Aaron,Great litttle bouncing board for our little  3 night trip to the Barossa.    Gave us the opportunity to sample the cullinary delights of the Barossa at our leisure.   The property is located pretty much 15 mins away from anywhere you might want to get to to sample the local produce.   The Studio is privately situated and had everything we needed for 3 nights stay.   Clean and comfortable at a very competitive price.  Would definitely come back.
1710462,10160631,2014-02-03,11466874,Mark&Jiseon,"Great location in the middle of a paddock and vineyard, the hosts have thought of every little detail to make your stay perfect. We got a bunch of nice food and from the area and used the fully equipped kitchen to make an amazing meal. The weather on our stay was over 40 but we were cool in the house thanks to a/c and fans. "
1710462,10410038,2014-02-17,6706172,Tim,"It was a real pleasure to stay in this ""shed"". Very relaxing, quiet and private with wonderful views over the vineyards. Accommodations just as described and very well equipped. Kylie and Tom were great hosts. Highly recommended."

1710462,10981800,2014-03-16,9130694,Jane,"Kylie and Tom's studio amongst the vines is a modern and spacious place to stay in. Well situated on the Sturt Highway at the entrance to the Barossa Valley, the studio had everything you would need and more. Kylie was very generous offering us a later checkout even when we hadn't requested it. "
1710462,11115286,2014-03-21,9271107,Erin,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Shea Oak Log and Kylie and Tom were great hosts - very helpful when we needed something, but otherwise left us on our own. The studio has a great kitchen for cooking and is just a nice, comfortable space to relax in."
1710462,11463951,2014-04-04,10708879,Lisa,"Kylie and Tom have a beautiful shed in Shea-Oak Log with a comfortable bed and a great kitchen and they are excellent and very helpful hosts. The apartment is located just off Sturt Highway, so it is easily accessible from Adelaide and a perfect spot for exploring the Barossa Valley."
1710462,11536228,2014-04-07,11645618,Carol,"We stayed for two nights in the Shea-Oak vineyard studio in early April and really enjoyed both the rural environment and the Barossa Valley wine. We were on a long trip so it was especially good to have a good bed, quiet, and a good place to cook for ourselves. The interior of the studio is smart and comfortable. Many thanks!"
1710462,11814570,2014-04-15,5037288,Jamie,"We loved our stay at the Shea-Oak studio! Set right amongst the vineyards and only a 10 minute drive to town we were perfectly positioned to get the most out of our stay in Barossa. The unit is actually a 1 bedroom (not a one room studio as I first assumed as an American) and comfortably spacious. The kitchen is fully renovated and equipped with everything you might need to cook a meal at home - important when you are buying wine during the day for evening consumption! The bed was extremely comfortable (loved the heating pad). All in all, great unit and excellent value for the Barossa!"
1710462,11890736,2014-04-18,12975854,Gerry,"A superb place to stay - it's got all the necessities and is situated in a terrifically convenient location. It takes just 45-60 mins to get into the heart of the Barossa (if you take the scenic route, like we did) but if you need to get to Gawler quickly, it's just 15 mins away.

Lovely hosts and a great spot. "
1710462,11976823,2014-04-20,9397048,Linda,"We nestled in Kylie & Tom's studio shed right away. Stayed 2 nights, with a comfortable bed, clean amenities and a convenient drive to the Barossa Valley. Beautiful wine region. Kylie and Tom were friendly and made sure we got to the place ok. Our morning was amazing with the sun shining in the studio with the view of vineyards around us. Will definitely visit again."
1710462,12057023,2014-04-22,4276223,Rónán,Great place. Has everything you need for the perfect stay in the Barossa. 
1710462,12149391,2014-04-24,3871540,Lucy,We had a great time staying in the studio. It is much larger than we expected and we appointed! The accommodation is very comfortable and clean and the hosts were available if needed. The location is near to the highway approaching the Barossa Valley so we enjoyed only having to travel for 10 minutes to get to many of the cellar doors. Thanks for the great stay Kylie and Tom!
1710462,12218976,2014-04-26,14066354,Demetrio,A fantastic few days in the Barossa in this beautiful studio fitted with all the essentials and close to all the best parts of the Barossa. Highly recommend and would stay again. 
1710462,12717157,2014-05-09,13425770,Natasa,"We had an enjoyable 2-night stay at the Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio Shed. Kylie and Tom responded promptly to our emails before we arrived. Directions on the listing were spot-on and check-in/check-out was easy. The studio shed was clean and spacious. The kitchen was well-appointed which was great for dining in. Good supply of tea, coffee, milk and cereal. We loved being so close to the vines. A fabulous base to explore the wineries in the Barossa Valley!"
1710462,13248626,2014-05-23,13275565,Kriz,"This accommodation was well above expectations - the picture was very accurate of the clean,well designed accommodation"
1710462,14083250,2014-06-11,14529878,Rebekah,"We absolutely loved our stay. The cabin was in a central position in the Barossa and it was exceptionally clean. 
 
Kylie and Tom were great hosts. We would definitely go back. "
1710462,14305134,2014-06-16,9274232,Thoa,"We loved staying at Kylie and Tom's converted shed - great location, all the modern amenities, cozy and perfect for all our needs. They were gracious and thoughtful and had the place warmed up for us by the time we arrived as we walked in on a very stormy day. Looked forward to getting back every night after a full day of local sightseeing and wine tasting. Thanks again Kylie and Tom!"
1710462,14635627,2014-06-23,9155378,Han,"Amazing place! It was so beautiful, so cozy, but with all the amenities. Kylie had the heating turned on ready for our arrival, and Tom - our hero - met us with his tractor to drag us out of a bog - serious service!! It was such a cute place, and was an easy drive to the wineries. "
1710462,15596680,2014-07-12,14535456,Col,"Kylie and Tom provide private and comfortable accomodation with great facilities. We found the Shed to be a perfect launching pad into the Barossa and Kylie had the Air con on so even though outside was 5 degrees we immediately felt cosy! 
Facilities were great - comfy bed with chocolate supplied! and a choice of teas and coffees!
Would highly recommend The Shed to all - in fact I have already told half a dozen of my friends - reasonable rates and excellent hosts!"
1710462,15848847,2014-07-16,3239808,Belinda,"What a great experience.  It would have to be the cleanest and best equipped air bnb I have stayed in.  Kylie and Tom were great to deal with and very accommodating.  A great gateway to the Barossa Wineries.  I can highly recommend, and I will be back. "
1710462,15987578,2014-07-19,3858886,Angela,"A clean, cosy and convenient place to stay while exploring the Barossa. We did not meet Kylie and Tom as you are able to come and go and enjoy the space privately. But a little schnauzer did come say hello. It is great value when compared to the other available accommodation in the area, equipped with a very handy kitchen and a very comfortable and beautifully presented bed. The hosts left a great list of vineyard recommendations all of which we loved visiting. "
1710462,16986046,2014-08-05,16640283,Josie,"Wonderful accommodation on a beautiful little vineyard, in a great location to visit the Barossa Vineyards"
1710462,17884058,2014-08-18,4785244,Geri,"Check in and finding the property was easy, and it was a close drive to the Barossa. Room was super comfortable and we had everything we needed available, with lovely considerate small touches. Would stay again :)"
1710462,18152390,2014-08-22,14839062,Carlene & Tony,"We had a wonderful stay In the Barossa.  The converted shed is really cozy, had everything we needed, comfy and warm bed.  It was a lovely retreat whilst exploring the Barossa.  Was a little noise from traffic in the morning but only as a light sleeper would notice.  Great accommodation, thanks Tom and Kylie for having us and porridge which I hadn't had in years - delicious! "
1710462,18317893,2014-08-25,17585817,Laura,"The property was exactly what we needed for touring the Barossa, the pictures fairly represent what you get, it was clean and well equipped.  The shower was excellent, bed was good and the electric blanket was a godsend on the cold spring nights.  It is worth noting however that there is road noise 24/7 so bring some ear plugs if you are a light sleeper.  Overall excellent value for money and very well situated."
1710462,20491348,2014-09-30,7337390,Robert,The Studio was a great base for exploring the Barossa. It is really well equipped and very comfortable and while nothing is within walking distance all of the main centres are within a short drive. We did not meet Kylie and Tom but they were great with communications including arrival instructions.
1710462,20740559,2014-10-05,13928153,Pat And Rob,Perfect in every way!    Wonderful place. 
1710462,20891426,2014-10-07,1472976,Dylan & Charlie,"Accommodation was perfect, in a great location.  Everything as per the pictures."
1710462,21505291,2014-10-19,16554299,Jillana,"We never met our host, but everything was waiting for us when we arrived in Barossa.  The place was FANTASTIC, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and location.  This property is a gem!  The only thing we wanted for was wi-fi, which was found in local coffee houses nearby."
1710462,21664969,2014-10-21,16267536,Nadia,"We had a great stay at Kylie and Tom's. Spacious and modern accommodation, great location- great for a weekend exploring the Barossa! Kylie and Tom were communicative and friendly. Definitely recommend!  "
1710462,22015819,2014-10-28,7045592,Shelley,"Kylie and Tom's Shea-Oak Vineyard Studio was very clean and well presented. It was well priced and in a good location about 15 minutes drive from most of the vineyards and nearby towns. Kylie and Tom were helpful hosts. When we needed to contact them they were available. They left us welcoming chocolate biscuits, as well as tea, coffee and some milk. The studio was well priced. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay on the edge of the Barossa Valley."
1710462,22288796,2014-11-03,15064936,Michael,Cosy and comfortable place to stay close to the Barossa. Close to the Sturt Hwy for easy drives to the main wineries.
1710462,22600268,2014-11-10,8079668,Monique,"The place was lovely, it had everything we needed and then some. The kitchen was so well stocked with cooking utensils it was so easy to cook without having to make any compromises. The bed is so comfy too. Overall it's a great little place to stay out of the way but still with great access to the central towns of the Barossa Valley. The couple of times we needed to speak to Kylie she was very friendly and helpful. We would love to stay there again & recommend it to everyone."
1710462,22902979,2014-11-17,567406,Sarah,Amazing place! Literally right on a vineyard with everything you could want in an accommodation. A must stay for your Barossa trip. We'll be back.
1710462,23014819,2014-11-20,23198083,Bronwyn,"Accurate description. Hosts always friendly and available if needed but happy to let us keep to ourselves. Good communication. Loved the locality, spacious quarters, very clean, comfortable, well equipped and pleasant decor. Set back from the road but fairly busy truck route-not too noisy but noticeable. Easy drive to Barossa Valley attractions, pleasant drive to Adelaide area, Adelaide Hills, Clare Valley."
1710462,23421516,2014-12-01,12947304,Aaron," Our hosts Kylie and Tom were keen, friendly and helpful communicators and at the same time allowed us privacy during our stay. Kylie and Tom's set up at Shea-Oak Log Vineyard Studio is comfortable, neat and tidy, with nice quality furniture and fittings throughout and are all appreciated after a hard day's exploring. In particular, the kitchen is well-equipped and the bedroom furniture appears new. The bed is very comfortable. It is also well-situated as a base to explore the nearby wine regions. Highly recommended accommodation."
1710462,23936393,2014-12-15,2942799,Sandra,"We had a wonderful time staying at Shea-Oak Log vineyard studio.   The studio was more than the pictures : with chocolates on our pillows, extra bedding for our kids, strong shower with hot water, fully equipped kitchen with wine glasses, organized cutlery and cooking utensils, including cable TV.  There was even an electric blanket for us, little details but so thoughtful for guests.   The location is perfect to drive up to Adelaide Hills and explore Barossa Valley on a daily basis.  Short drives and easy access to come home every day.  A perfect retreat with all the comforts of a studio."
1710462,24130741,2014-12-21,16645757,Vaurian,"Beautifully appointed studio, cosy and comfortable with everything you need for a stay in the Barossa. About 15 minutes to Nuriootpa and a few more to Tanunda and Angaston which is great for day trips to winery's but maybe a little far if you want to go in for dinner, we only went out 1 night in 3.
Kylie and Tom live in a fabulous part of Australi"
1710462,24599377,2014-12-31,14404888,Sonny,"Our stay at Kylie and Tom's studio shed was very pleasant and comfortable. The hosts were flexible and accommodating in arrival & departure times. Everything just went very smooth and seamless. The kitchen is fully equipped and has cutlery, pots & pans to cook. The bathroom comes with towels. It was a perfect base to explore Barossa! Highly recommended."
1710462,25016945,2015-01-05,15239363,Simon,"'The Shed' was a fantastic spot for our stay, surrounded by vines with no-one around other than Kylie and Tom's home about 500m away, this really did feel like our very own quiet slice of the Barossa. The studio had everything we needed including aircon which Kylie switched on for us before our arrival (it was very warm on the two days we were there 40+). Although we had very little contact with Kylie and Tom they left us with everything we needed, including breakfast. A brilliant place to stay for any couple's Barossa experience!"
1710462,25467753,2015-01-17,23759431,Deirdre,"We stayed at Shea-Oak whilst exploring the Barossa. It was a great location, away from the hustle & bustle but close enough to enjoy everything. The house was clean, relaxing, spacious & had everything we needed. It was a great place to stay. "
1710462,25559127,2015-01-19,25440952,Kenneth,"Awesome place and not too far from where all the action is. Tom was awesome and personally brought us some brand new wine glasses when there was only 1 there. 
Cute and cozy place. Nice and convenient "
1710462,25666032,2015-01-22,8888331,Jacqui,Kylie and Tom left us to our own devices which was convenient for us. They were available by telephone and made sure we knew that they were approachable. We had to call them when we were having issues with the oven and Kylie came quickly to the rescue! We had an excellent weekend and felt like the Studio Shed was our little home for the short time we had there. 
1710462,25858239,2015-01-27,20840948,Kate,We loved our stay at the studio! Kylie and Tom where so lovely and not only did we feel at home we had everything we could possibly need! A little gem that we would highly recommend! 
1710462,26054531,2015-02-02,25040051,Mitchell,"Everything was perfect from the chocolates on the pillows to the full stocked kitchen and even a wine delivery from your daughter Belle!! (Great wine by the way)

A great way to see the Barossa and we will recommend the studio to all of our friends.
 
Thank you for an amazing trip.
 
Kind Regards
A very happy customer,
Mitch"
1710462,26589063,2015-02-16,16399411,Johan,"We had a great stay over the Valentines Day weekend. Kylie&Tom were a pleasure to communicate with pleasure and left us to our own devices. The Barossa Valley townships were easily accessible and the apartment was modern, clean and stocked with basics. It was 40 degrees outside but between two air conditioners and a fan, it was fine. Some reviews talk of truck noice from the highway 100m away but I'm a light sleeper and had no troubles at all. Would stay again!!"
1710462,27144564,2015-02-26,8677799,Kate,"Kylie and Tom were very prompt in responding to our requests and even worked out with us to stay an extra night in their gorgeous studio (in the midst of their grapevines).  They have a wonderful eye for design and detail, with nothing was left out that you could need - a range of great teas, and even a couple of buttons in case you lose yours!  We stayed for 3 nights and were glad we did.  The location is perfect for wine tasting throughout the Barossa Valley - and close enough to grocery stores and other amenities.  

A great respite at the end of the day!"
1710462,27321864,2015-03-02,13015952,Scott,We were very happy with our stay at Shea-Oak Log. It was not necessary for us to have face to face contact with Kylie and Tom but we had their contact details if there were any issues. The photos and description are exactly what we found and the details provided prior to our arrival on how to get there and get in etc were very easy to follow. Thank you for a very enjoyable stay!
1710462,27638408,2015-03-09,14580306,Kelly,"The house was really easy to find and in a really nice spot. It was closer to the main highway than I first thought, but that did make exploring the area really lovely. The house was really well decorated and nice and cosy. Perfect for a couple of days. "
1710462,28238198,2015-03-20,9732202,Mia,Loved every minute of it. Easy to find situated amongst beautiful vineries. Went for a walk. Very close to all the Barossa has to offer. Great little getaway from Adelaide.
1710462,28488038,2015-03-24,8805125,Jie,"My partner and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Studio. The Studio was very equipped and has everything we could possibly need. The place is bright, spacious and spotless. I would highly recommend anyone who is planning to visit Barrosa to stay at this studio. The place is perfect for a weekend away or staying for longer. "
1710462,29051945,2015-04-03,26333353,Kimberley,"Had a lovely stay at Shea Oak, easily accessible to the Barossa which was lots of fun. Enjoyed staying amongst the vines. Would definitely stay again and recommend it to others!"
1710462,29384374,2015-04-07,15578359,Alicia,"they provided very easy instructions, the studio was fully stocked, quick access to highway. There was lots of information on local wineries provided. 
Didn't meet Kylie or Tom but knew they were available if needed. 

costs about $50 to catch a cab to the nearest town Tanunda

highway could be a little loud BUT it's not a busy highway and it probably only seems loud because the countryside is so quiet! 

comfy bed and HEAPS of pillows."
1710462,29577713,2015-04-09,25770204,Kelly,"We really enjoyed our 2 night stay at the Studio. The location couldn't be anymore convenient to where we wanted to be in the Barossa. Our hosts had included all the comforts that we would need and made it ideal for making breakfasts easy with their lovely additions in the morning (jams, porridge, coffee, tea). 
Will be recommending to any friends who are travelling that way! "
1710462,30020137,2015-04-16,7813972,Brad,The studio was a nice place to see the Barossa. It had everything that we needed and was about 15 minutes from shops of Tanunda. We enjoyed a great wine tour from mark at Barossa cruisin'.
1710462,30185077,2015-04-19,7473198,Kristina,"Kylie and Tom's vineyard shed is the perfect place for a Barossa getaway! Cosy and beautifully modern, with all the comforts and facilities that you could need to relax. Lovely breakfast goodies put out for us, fresh towels and immaculately clean.
The vineyard setting is great, and very easy to find off the main highway. Great brochures and recommendations of what to do and see in the Barossa Valley - all within a 30 minute drive from the Studio shed.
Thank you for a wonderful stay. Will be back!"
1710462,30392816,2015-04-21,28903316,Palash,"The accommodation was neat and clean - everything we expected. Tom and Kylie were superb with their communication. I could see their house - what seemed like 500 metres away - however, the unit we booked was secluded and we felt like we had the vines to ourselves. We dined at Hentley Farm - which was a $40 cab fare. We were able to order pizza delivery for dinner (as we couldn't drive upon our return) - so the shack itself is serviced by everything that is needed. I'd recommend it. Big comfy bed. Tea and breakfast provisions. The barossa on your door step - excellent place to stay and well priced."
1710462,30778334,2015-04-27,15334505,Madeleine,"I did not get to meet the hosts personally, but the place was set up perfectly for us. We arrived late, and they left the lights and heats on for us. It was a great base for us exploring the Barossa. i especially enjoyed the electric blankets and shower!"
1710462,31318859,2015-05-04,29431306,James,"Thank you Kylie & Tom! What a wonderful place you have in the Barossa! Just perfect for a weekend getaway, removed from town but only a short distance to everything you need in the area! Great unique accommodation, hosts & views. "
1710462,32251903,2015-05-16,5216646,Laura,"The studio shed was perfect for our short stay in the Barossa! Easy drive to everything, and the studio itself was very spacious and comfortable. I have already recommended it to friends for their Barossa trips!!"
1710462,32611034,2015-05-19,7295651,Andrea,"To describe that place in one word... WOW... But if you like awesome is fine (Website hidden by Airbnb) a bit isolate, so you need the car, but that's a plus if you are looking for a week end for you and your family/lover. If your arrival is during twilight you will find the light that drives you.. Open the door and you will see how the shed has been set-up for you... You feel like at home... My suggestion is to take with you everything you might need:food and good wine ,from Barossa,of course. You will find all the information to visit Barossa and if you might need something more, text them and they will let you know whatever you after!
Absolutely recommend!!"
1710462,32886614,2015-05-23,25921141,Sophie,"We had a great 2 nights stay in this lovely apartment on the vineyard. Very peaceful and a great spot to explore the Barossa from. Very comfortable and would definitely recommend it to friends and family. 
Thanks Kylie and Tom"
1710462,33228725,2015-05-26,2188730,Thomas,"Clean, comfortable and modern self contained place ten minutes from tanunda. Kylie & tom were lovely hosts and made our stay easy and were even able to accommodate our pug Giuseppe. Being surrounded by all the vines on an operational vineyard was a great way to experience the Barossa. Highly recommended!"
1710462,34538554,2015-06-09,1475985,Kaitlin,We loved staying here. A perfect place to base yourself in the Barossa. I have already recommended it to many friends.
1710462,35243826,2015-06-16,163922,Benedict,Kylie and Tom were great hosts. The place was well setup and made a good base camp to explore the Barossa. We felt very welcome (thanks for providing an infant cot!) and definitely recommend staying here.
1710462,35912120,2015-06-23,12167438,Thomas,"Kylie reached out well before we arrived and ensured the place was ready for us, very good communication. Very good spot and nice and quiet, the unit was exactly as described. Perfect for a weekend getaway in the Barossa."
1710462,36898496,2015-07-02,11139261,Graham,The studio was a fantastic place to stay and explore the Barossa from. Very clean and private with everything you need. Highly recommend it!
1710462,37162918,2015-07-05,7123914,Sonya,"My husband and I really loved our stay at The Studio, it was beautifully laid out and so comfortable. We also loved the horse that came to greet is each morning and night when we returned from a day out. It took us 15-20 minutes to drive wherever we wanted to go in the Barossa Valley and we left feeling totally refreshed. We also loved being able to cook after a few nights on the road."
1710462,38128568,2015-07-13,33636911,Rick,"Cute pleasant place, bed is warm and comfortable and the hot water runs freely.  Hosts were communicative throughout: thanks."
1710462,38496743,2015-07-16,21593129,Lauren,We had a lovely stay at the Shed. It was so homely and comfortable. The location is excellent being close enough to all the wineries. I would recommend the 'shed' to anyone. Very relaxing! 
1710462,40898966,2015-08-03,10955856,Ali,"She-oak Studio was a gorgeous place to stay for our Barossa weekend. A cosy cottage with all the mod cons we needed. Kylie and Tom made sure we were warm and comfy despite out late (and cold!)evening arrival; lights and heater were on for us, and brekkie goodies were left for us too.
Delighted by the horse in the paddock adjacent the studio, who was keen for a pat and to say hello! 
Thanks guys!"
1710462,42173532,2015-08-11,36150022,Jill,"What a fantastic experience-Tom and Kylie were utterly lovely to deal with from go-to-woah, nothing was too much trouble. The property was perfect - extremely clean, very affordable, well-stocked with everything we might need and then some, private, plus perfectly located for exploring the beautiful Barossa. We had an absolute blast during our stay, and would highly recommend this home away from home and it's wonderful hosts. Was lovely to meet Vinnie the pony too "
1710462,46036094,2015-09-07,42332381,Laura,We absolutely adored this property! It's in the perfect location to explore the Barossa and was very much a home away from home! Kylie and Tom had thought of all the little details to make our stay comfortable and the views on their property are stunning! 
1710462,47036427,2015-09-15,11087307,Quynh,"If you want privacy and a home away from home, this is where you should stay in the Barossa. With a baby, we were provided with a cot and having a full kitchen allowed us to stay in at night and make dinner. The sunrise every morning was spectacular. "
1710462,47987171,2015-09-22,31636865,Rosmaya,The studio is even lovelier than the pictures. We really enjoyed the stay albeit it's only one night. It's serene and peaceful and yet close to key attractions and wineries. You can even view sunset from the lounge. Kylie and Tom were very kind to allow us to stay for one night only and lots of care had been put in to welcome us. We also had a little surprise on our pillows - individual Tim Tam ;-) and we loved watching your friendly pony. The only regret was we wished we could stay longer. We highly recommend this place to anyone. Thanks.
1710462,49003576,2015-09-30,10859271,Jill,"We had a terrific stay at Kylie & Tom's studio at Shea Oak Log. It was very clean, comfortable and stylish. As we stayed there for 3 nights, we appreciated the full kitchen which was very well equipped and a nice touch with the De Longhi machine and pods. The bed was very comfortable and it was a great base to explore the Barossa. "
1710462,49310500,2015-10-03,15829956,James,Great holiday studio. It was even better than the photos and made the perfect base for a barossa trip. The hosts Kylie and Tom were very welcoming although not obtrusive at all.
1710462,50062081,2015-10-09,10725760,Karina,"Loved staying at the cabin, perfect for exploring the Barossa and was nice and private. Thanks for a great stay  Kylie and Tom!"

1710462,52064619,2015-10-26,10496185,Rose,"What a gem in the middle of the Barossa Valley! Only a short drive the vineyards and local restaurants and shops. Kylie and Tom have thought of everything one might need for a stay in the Barossa (i.e. comfortable bed, maps of the Barossa, coffee machine, fully equipped kitchen, winery recommendations, etc). It was lovely to stay on a vineyard (right outside the door), and still have the privacy of a hotel. Highly recommend! Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer. Thank you Kylie and Tom for making our first trip to the Barossa a memorable one."

The kitchen had lots of amenities, and the hot water promised lovely hot showers morning and night. The chocolates on our pillow were just the loveliest touch, and their terribly cute pony, Red, would greet us everyday as he stayed in a nearby paddock. The location was very convenient, as it's just a short drive to endless wineries and only about 10 minutes to local shops/restaurants.

Kylie and Tom went above and beyond to make me feel welcome and also helped me out of the mud when I found myself bogged! 
This B&B played a huge part in why my trip to SA was so magical. 
It had everything I needed and so much more. 
Two heaters to keep you cosy all cooking appliances and lots of hot water!

We had to get picked up for a wine tour prior to checking in to their accomodation and they were very flexible with allowing us to leave our car on site. The facilities were everything we needed with some helpful information to help us navigate our way around the Barossa region. Location was nice and removed from the main parts of town but only a short car trip away. Also lovely to meet the pony and sheep in the paddock close by. Thanks again Kylie and Tom.

Cheers Mat and Hannah"

1710462,113430324,2016-11-12,3623468,Amy,"The studio was the perfect place to base ourselves for visiting the Barossa and extremely comfy. The bedroom has a blackout blind and the bed is enormous so we slept far longer than we'd planned to! It's a very quiet location and the windows overlook fields so you feel very remote, which we loved. It's so picturesque!

The studio had everything we needed for our stay, including an iron for those who, like me, always end up with screwed up clothes in the suitcase!

I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting the area and are looking for a peaceful, relaxing stay. Thank you Kylie and Tom :)"
1710462,114962305,2016-11-20,31772126,Cassandra,"My partner and I stayed at Kylie and Tom's place over the weekend for A Day on the Green. These guys were super friendly and helpful, quickly responding to my questions via the AirBnB app. Furthermore, the actual 'converted shed' is an absolute delight; once you're inside it feels like a small apartment, except you have the gorgeous backdrop of their property! A comfortable bed, clean and updated kitchen, and convenient parking were all extra pluses. An outstanding, 5/5 stay in the Barossa. Thanks so much, both of you!"

1710462,116087276,2016-11-27,11501087,Michael And Alexandra,"The Studio is situated about 10 minutes by car to a range of excellent vineyards.  Kylie and Tom have created a self contained studio, perfect for those wishing to wind down quietly after a busy day being a tourist.  It is so private in fact we never even met our hosts but they were only a phone call away had we needed to make contact.

The Studio has a full kitchen should you wish to cook. 

Check in and out was really simple - thank you. 

Great value for money!"
1710462,120021693,2016-12-07,15332350,Ros,We loved our stay at the Studio in She Oak Log! It was easy to find with the clearly communicated directions given to us by Kylie and Tom. It was a lovely base to explore the Barossa and come 'home' to at the end of the day.

1710462,123803113,2016-12-30,49383160,Olga,"Whilst the property is located a little further from the main Barossa towns of Tanunda or Angaston, it's very easy to get around, with most places being within 10 mins drive.  It's very close to Gawler, a very pleasant historical town that we really enjoyed.  The cottage has everything one needs for a comfortable stay.  As expected, we paid a little bit of a premium for staying during the Christmas/New Years time.  However, the non-peak rates seem to be an excellent value.  Would definitely consider staying there again. "
1710462,125075530,2017-01-03,34611462,Yvonne,"Instructions to the shed were clear and easy to get to. The space was cosy and comfortable. The noise from the road did not bother us. Although we did not meet Kylie and Tom, communication was very easy and friendly! Great value for money. We would stay there again. "
1710462,126047681,2017-01-08,91240147,Katelyn,Beautiful little studio. Very convent location and had everything you need. 
1710462,126432024,2017-01-11,98499265,Kate,Fantastic communication from hosts! 
1710462,126822543,2017-01-14,108051353,Matthew,"Amazing place to stay, secluded but nothing is too far away. A perfect balance!"
1710462,127621908,2017-01-19,7885092,Michele,"Unique and comfortable and quiet even though it not far from the highway, very good sound proof installation. Very amazed with the interior when the outside looks like a shed but the he interior is homely and welcoming."
1710462,128451343,2017-01-24,41509670,Laura,Perfectly located for exploring all the Barossa has to offer! Great place to stay with everything you will need! Loved the Nespresso machine! 
1710462,128840786,2017-01-27,109952006,John,"This is an ideal place to stay when visiting people in Gawler. A nice quite retreat 10 minutes away from Gawler itself to avoid the traffic congestion Gawler seems to suffer from but close enough to be handy for meals etc. Very nice accommodation indeed with everything a traveler could want and more.  This was a great find I will happily stay again and recommend it to freinds.
Cheers John "
1710462,129715592,2017-02-01,96740492,Nina,"Fabulous place so long as one of you will drive after wine tasting or take a tour!! So peaceful, so relaxing & such a great place with all the little creature comforts thought of "
1710462,133335912,2017-02-21,30673138,Melanie,"The studio is very cosy and well equipped. Very close to some great wineries in the Barossa . Kylie and Tom were great hosts, would happily stay here again."
1710462,134549697,2017-02-27,67272998,Amandine,"Good value for money. A lovely self contained studio. A bit of noise from the road however stunning stargazing opportunity, charming livestock, and abundance of privacy. "
1710462,135364385,2017-03-04,23904530,Joanna And Lachlan,"The Studio is gorgeous, comfortable and well located near many of the wineries. We felt right at home but were also in awe of the beautiful location and friendly animals. We were so relaxed and can't wait to come back--would highly recommend! "
1710462,136454698,2017-03-10,72465910,Elaine,"My husband and i stayed in shea oak studio in Feb 2017. The initial thing we noticed was that it wasn't a working vineyard, which we were hoping for as we come from an area in Tasmania with Vineyards all around us, and we knew it was getting close for the Barossa for their harvesting. But the Vineyard is quit rundown. The Studio on first impression was lovley, very clean, and had a few condiments in the fridge, tea , coffee, and a coffee making machine. Surprisingly quiet when the doors were shut, as it is close to the highway, but had not much impact on our stay. Nice touch with chocolates on our bed pillows. Need to be a bit careful in the bathroom when you get out of shower, as the tiles are very slippery, and as the shower door doesn't shut properly, it lets water out on the floor. You cant put the shower rug close to the door as the shower door will not open .  But other than that our stay was quit enjoyable. If we are every back in the Barossa, we would probably be staying in Tanunda, so we are close to restaurants and shops, as it was a little annoying that we has to drive to dinner , but couldn't have a few nice wines together due to driving back to the studio. But is that doesn't bother you, then this is a lovely place to stay, and fantastic value. "
1710462,136662356,2017-03-11,10490141,Megan,We loved our stay at Kylie and Tom's place! Great kitchen that we used to cook dinner with groceries from a nearby store. Perfect stay for our little family!
1710462,137013426,2017-03-12,6311453,Amy,"What a perfect spot to stay amongst the vines in the beautiful Barossa. The perfect size for two people, the converted shed is comfortable and cozy. Although Kylie and Tom weren't there when we visited, Kylie was in touch before our arrival and very easy to contact to organise check in. 
If ever we find ourselves back in the Barossa we will be sure to stay again. Thanks again !! "
1710462,138478726,2017-03-19,12748562,Caitlin,"Great apartment, very clean but not located centrally to wineries otherwise it was good. "
1710462,139521613,2017-03-25,24234101,Jennifer,"Amazing experience!!! Beautiful place with pretty central location. Kayle and Tom are very attentive and welcome. 
Happy to discover this part of Australia! "
1710462,140115279,2017-03-27,120605188,Stela,"Great little studio perfect for a couple to stay very private and close to barossa. We were impressed with all the amenities they thought of everything including foil and gladwrap to pack a lunch for the day, also cooking staples provided like oil salt and even spices. We would stay there again!"
1710462,142172092,2017-04-07,124328906,Lisa,"Sensational bed. Super comfy. Great facilities and little extras. Close to Gawal, Tanunda and Lyndoch. Kylie was warm and welcoming and allowed me to enjoy private use of her gorgeous little place. I'd visit again without any problem."
1710462,142597500,2017-04-08,121615261,Toby,"Super hosts, great communication-perfect for our lunch in the Barossa"
1710462,144928429,2017-04-16,4770762,Eleanor,"Kylie and Tom's studio was a wonderful place to spend a long weekend. It has an extremely well equipped kitchen which was great as we cooked in every night. The open plan kitchen and living was a great space; lovely and bright during the day, and cosy at night. Check in and out was super easy. The location was lovely, there was a little bit of road noise, but nothing to be worried about. It was very easy to reach nearby towns in the Barossa.
Overall it was a great place and we would thoroughly recommend!  "
1710462,145763439,2017-04-19,67184434,Tim,"Great value accommodation near the Barossa region.
Lovely little studio to just relax in between checking out the wineries and restaurants of the region."
1710462,146837787,2017-04-23,116187747,Hannah,"Had everything we needed for a few nights in the Barossa. Was easy to drive to all the towns from here- was a tiny further out from what we expected but we are new to the Barossa and it was clear in the description. 
Overall exactly what we needed, there was a bit of noise from the highway so if your a light sleeper I'd say bring ear plugs - my husband had no trouble at all though! Barossa is beautiful and well worth a visit!"
1710462,148078547,2017-04-30,29556400,William,Comfy and cozy base from which to explore the Baross
1710462,151236354,2017-05-11,70098691,Alan,"We stayed for a week in early May at Kylie and Tom's studio unit. It is just off the main highway, around half way between Gawler and the main Barossa towns such as Tanunda, Nuriootpa and Angaston and just on the edge of the Barossa Valley. By car , the main areas of interest are still very accessible, being around 10-15 min drive away on very good roads. The unit itself was excellent, especially well set up for self catering (which is what we wanted). The accommodation was very comfortable and good value. We would definitely use this unit again if we were back in the Barossa."
1710462,151671995,2017-05-13,47531335,Jonas,"This cottage was a fantastic base for exploring the Barossa Valley.  We had a hassle free stay with check-in, check-out being straight forward.  Only a 10 minute drive to Gawler for all our necessities."
1710462,154517932,2017-05-25,92861100,Benjamin,"Spent a beautiful three nights in the secluded shea oak log, only a 15 min drive to tanunda and a truly beautiful spot to visit. The space was great and had everything you needed. There was no wifi, but phone reception was great so it didn't matter."
1710462,154957193,2017-05-26,39788700,Kathryn,Loved it. Everything we needed.   Close to McLeod Country. Great place to come back to and relax. I would stay again and re recommend to others 
1710462,155266693,2017-05-28,101803340,Monica,Beautiful well-equipped cottage with lots of extras such as plush linen and travel tips of the area. Can highly recommend it. 
1710462,159872060,2017-06-12,51096850,Sarah,Quiet and private space that's still close to the region's attractions.  This was a perfect base to explore the Barossa. 
1710462,161407310,2017-06-18,1310075,Georgina,"Very comfortable and warm - even though it was freezing outside. :)
Would stay here again!"
1710462,164037077,2017-06-26,6849761,Sarah & Bernard,"What an amazing bungalow! 
We had such an wonderful stay at Kylie and Tom's converted shed. It had absolutely everything we needed. They have done a fantastic job at setting up the place fully equipped with everything you'd need for a weekend away. The kitchen was perfect for cooking in, comfortable bed and a spacious living area. 
We were a bit concerned about the location before arriving, however if you have a car, it's no issue at all! Very easy to drive to wineries. Just keep in mind, if you were to get a cab to any of the wineries, it will cost at least $80 return for only a 10 minute drive down the road! 
Some reviews suggested a lot of road noice. This was not an issue for us at all and slept peacefully every night. 
We will definitely be returning to Shea-Oak Log! 
"
1710462,165753174,2017-07-02,6951044,Katia,"Kylie & Tom's place was fabulous - secluded and quiet, but only a short drive from the nearest towns and the best of the Barossa. The unit was clean, spacious and modern, which is to say extremely comfortable - we could have stayed for a week! Absolutely loved it. "
1710462,166907651,2017-07-05,101591125,Sian,"The studio is a beautiful retreat! It was quiet and private, a perfect home away from home. With only a 15 minute drive to basically everything Barossa it was a great base to explore and warm and cozy to return to for the night in the middle of winter. Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job making it immaculate and throughly thought of everything you could need. Definitely recommended!"
1710462,167195693,2017-07-06,7278813,Margie,"Kylie and Tom are excellent hosts and the studio is a beautifully furnished and equipped, private haven. Although it is located quite close to the highway we found that the road noise was not a problem once we were inside the studio. and soon the revegetation planting will be tall enough to muffle it even more. We enjoyed everything about our stay and would highly recommend it."
1710462,168141518,2017-07-09,3582125,John,"Kylie & Tom's place was a great base for us during our stay.  It has everything you'll need, Kylie and Tom are easy to get in touch with and made the whole experience really easy.

Would highly recommend! "

Lots of added extras like suggestions on where to visit, how to get around, undercover parking, lovely linen and covers, electric blankets and great heating options. Thank you for fantastic studio accomodation !"
1710462,172110608,2017-07-20,15789620,Harvey,Well priced for a very comfortable and well supplied apartment. By car it's not too far to Gawler and the Barossa. We especially enjoyed cycling the Barossa Bike Trail- this time from Gawler to Tanunda - a dedicated bitumen track through the beautiful Barossa Valley  (once you've overcome the challenge of finding where it starts).
1710462,173180749,2017-07-23,6737753,Beth,"This was one of the best equipped airbnbs we've ever stayed in! Kitchen had everything we needed to make some tasty meals with produce we bought from the region. Can't recommend enough, very close to all the Barossa has to offer. We didn't meet the hosts but they were very clearly there for us if we needed anything (provided us with a host of phone numbers if necessary). Thanks for a positive experience!"
1710462,175833324,2017-07-30,42006095,Tory,Absolute bliss! We loved our stay at Shea-Oak! Thank you Kylie and Tom!

1710462,178164626,2017-08-05,6312338,Emily,"Kylie and Tom are great hosts! They were super communicative with our check-in and directions, gave us a couple of tips (maps and brochures) and even left a couple lights on for us to find the place as we arrived quite late (11pm). 
The place itself has a big and spacious living room, fully equipped kitchen and a super cosy bedroom with the most comfortable bed for relaxing after a day of exploring the Barossa. We only wished we stayed longer!"
1710462,178641161,2017-08-06,140199074,Lachlan,Great little place. Cosy and close to tanunda!
1710462,185563103,2017-08-22,41528318,Melvin,"This studio is highly recommended for anyone who wants a base in Barossa valley..! Great place with modern amenities. Check-in was super easy. Couldn't meet Kylie or Tom but they were reachable over the phone.
Would come back anytime.
Thanks Kylie & Tom."
1710462,189846097,2017-09-03,1192737,Wei Ai,"We had a great time at Kylie and Tom's studio. Everything we needed was available in the spacious one-bedroom studio. The bed is very comfortable after a long day wine-tasting, well-equipped kitchen and plenty of maps and brochures to find out things to do in the area. It's conveniently located just off the Sturt Hwy, a short drive to the many wineries of the Barossa. Definitely recommend!"
1710462,191808992,2017-09-09,83605226,Bek,"This was our first time using Air BnB and we weren't sure what to expect. We loved our stay, the studio is just perfect! Great communication and the animals are super cute. Highly recommend and such a bargain!"
1710462,193009070,2017-09-12,10576888,Kristina,"This is my second time stay at Kylie & Tom's log and it was even better than the first time! I love the privacy, the location, the utilities and how amazing the hosts are!

1710462,199766240,2017-10-03,138274449,Helen,"The Studio is sparkling as if brand new, yet it is beautifully set up to be intimate and cosy. Its hosts are near but not intrusive. The location is quiet, easy to find and perfect for Heysen Trail walkers or Barossa visitors who have visiting the region's excellent wineries and restaurants and markets on their mind. It is easy to see why many guests intend to stay here again."
1710462,201214059,2017-10-08,147496912,Anthony,We loved the place to the point where we felt like we could live in it long-term.
1710462,202348534,2017-10-11,90549559,Barbara,"Wow! We thought we arrived in a luxury hotel when we entered the studio. Everything you could want or need was there, it was very clean and lovely touches like the chocolate on the pillow just made us feel so welcome. Thank you so much, Kylie and Tom."
1710462,203047346,2017-10-14,46214105,Kristina,"A perfect place to stay! The surrounding views were beautiful, the place itself was cosy and comfortable with everything you'd need. Great value for money and good for visiting the Barossa if you have a car. Thanks so much Kylie and Tom"
1710462,203327374,2017-10-15,2072132,Louise,"We had a great time at the studio! It was perfect for us with a little bubba, and kylie set up a porta cot for us, making out stay extra easy. After leaving a few things at the studio, kylie had very generously offered to post them back to us- we couldn't have asked for better hosts, and it was such a perfect location in the Barossa."
1710462,204392449,2017-10-18,31728464,Chloe,"Kylie and Tom's place was great for a couple of nights in the Barossa, it is fully equipped, but a little way from any main shops/towns such as Tanunda/Lyndoch, but if you have a car it's a beautiful area to drive around.  I didn't meet Kylie or Tom, but received all the info I needed for our stay a couple of days before our arrival, and knew they were just a call away should I need anything else. "
1710462,205330430,2017-10-22,131268812,David,Lovely studio.  Well appointed and close to the wineries. Had a great stay.

1710462,207786168,2017-10-29,155046778,Laura,"A lovely little shed at first glance, but definitely a home away from home! Beautiful location and very friendly hosts in the stunning area of the Barossa Valley. Would love to stay again one day soon. Thanks Kylie and Tom"

1710462,209747461,2017-11-05,81173080,Iain,"Great communication, clean and modern place .  Well equipped for a good price. Only fault I have is the traffic noise."

1710462,212668462,2017-11-18,7029905,Silvia,"Very lovely place to stay! Kylie and Tom have done a wonderful job styling and decorating and if we stayed more than one night the kitchen would have come in very handy!  It's in an excellent location for the wineries, and is situated at a nice and private part of the property. An excellent get away! :-)"
1710462,214127346,2017-11-24,138613341,Rebecca,"We stayed at Kylie and Tom's place for three nights. It was a secluded and private building far back from the highway and it provided us with all the comforts at home. It was wonderful for us to be able to collapse on the comfortable couche under the air conditioner after a long hard day sampling the delights of the Barossa. It is a well-located and ideal place to explore the region, and I cannot recommend it enough! Thank you, Nick and Rebecca"
1710462,215144814,2017-11-27,42155496,Cherie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the quiet of rural surrounds (although you do get some muffled traffic noise from the main road) - and enjoyed the space looking out towards the hills, and over the fields etc.  This is actually a one-bedroom place, and was beautifully setup and clean with everything we needed. The nespresso machine was an extra bonus! A very refreshing time there!"
1710462,216007451,2017-12-02,3398589,Robert,Great location less than 10 minutes to amazing wineries and restaurants. Lovely place with wonderful hosts. Highly recommended. Look forward to staying again!
1710462,218749808,2017-12-14,106968577,Zak,The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

1710462,220775987,2017-12-23,153562066,Meryl,"Private with great amenities. Kylie and Tom were close but left me to myself - just what I needed. Good location for the activities I wanted to do  - an easy drive to the Barossa, Clare Valley and Gawler. And the pony saying 'hello' one morning was a cheerful bonus."
1710462,224688405,2018-01-04,18393551,Kayla-Lynn,"Communication was extremely quick. They left us to our vices, but were available if we needed anything. The place was very tidy and you would never guess that you were staying a shed from the inside. The location was very convenient, but a little noisier than expected due to it's location off a major highway. That being said traffic was very limited during the late hours. Great local suggestions were provided to explore during our stay. Would recommend :)"
1710462,225534301,2018-01-06,17269400,Amy,"Perfect location for exploring the Barossa Valley- you’re only 15 mins outside of the main town Tanunda. 
This apartment is such great value for money! We were blown away by it. Good communication- Kylie responded promptly to any emails or text messages I sent and were happy to engage with us when we wanted. 
I’ll definitely be staying here again on my next visit!"
1710462,243989768,2018-03-17,51196874,Angelique,"For a  weekend getaway to the Barossa, Kylie and Tom’s place was perfect. From the reserved location to the quality of the linen and towels, it truly was lovely to be able to rewind at their air bnb after a full day of wining and dining. The folder full of local recommendations was a great touch too!

Thank you!"
1710462,246155823,2018-03-25,42821325,Sandy,Great spot halfway between Barossa and Gawler
1710462,247842355,2018-03-30,116665777,Bianca,"A beautiful studio away from the busy city in a quiet secluded area. Very easy to find and it is a short drive from Barossa Valley. The studio has everything you need for a weekend away, we will definitely be back again."

1710462,257913702,2018-04-28,26927616,Deborah,"This is an easy place to find and a good location to explore the valley. Kylie and Tom were unobtrusive but there if needed, and responded to our concerns, making us feel welcome. The decor and attention to detail made this place feel like your own. Everything you would need was there and more.
Traffic noise in the quiet of the country could annoy, if you let it, but the comfort of the place far outweighed what some earplugs would provide."
1710462,258257213,2018-04-29,157862729,Cj,Perfectly clean! Quite a bit of highway noise but the glass doors block some of it out. Thanks for having us!
1710462,261134828,2018-05-06,173087716,Brooke,A perfect little studio close to great wineries in the Barossa. Had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Will be back again!
1710462,263806740,2018-05-13,68804067,Lynn,"Kylie and Tom’s studio was great for our short stay in the Barossa. 
We were very comfortable.
It’s a little out of town but the clear directions given made it easy to find and we loved  being out in the countryside.
We would recommend and would love to stay again."
1710462,266297396,2018-05-20,72251927,Evan,"We had a lovely stay. Tanunda and great wineries all close by, and the Barossa Farmers market. We especially loved our sheep and calf neighbours, they're very friendly and like to say hi through the fence."
1710462,266954178,2018-05-20,23406354,Leith,Take some earplugs if traffic noise bothers you but this is one of the best value and more unique stays I've experienced thru Airbnb. Would love to come again in the future and see how Kylie and Tom have progressed since the bushfire damaged the property. Good luck guys!
1710462,269168556,2018-05-27,29201754,Lija,Had a great stay at Kylie and Tom's place. Awesome little place right near the Barossa. super easy to get to all of the wineries. Definitely recommend!!

1710462,303643523,2018-08-08,26566910,Tilly,"An affordable little cabin on the edge of the Yarra Valley however id recommend staying in Tanunda as opposed to here, as right on the main highway. "
1710462,309186325,2018-08-18,21357683,Jordan,A great place to stay for the night. Easy to find and comfortable

1710462,325854005,2018-09-21,56158532,Heidi,Suited our needs as we were waiting for our house to become available as we are moving to the valley.  Loved the outlook and privacy and still close enough to everything. Would be a good place to base yourself if holidaying.
1710462,327983838,2018-09-25,3825195,Randi,Easy check in & pretty close to everything. Great central spot for exploring the Barossa Valley.

1710462,330745663,2018-10-01,8011110,David,"This studio was perfect for an overnight stay, clean, modern and spacious. It's in the middle of a field but the vineyards and towns are just a short drive away."
1710462,332261949,2018-10-05,145465507,Donna,Sheaoak Log Studio is a great little place for exploring the Barossa region.  It is conveniently located just off the Sturt Highway and a short drive to Greenock or Seppeltsfield (about 5 minutes) or a longer drive to Tanunda (about 10 minutes).  You definitely require a car to stay here. The Studio contains a full kitchen which we appreciated. Bed was comfortable. Air conditioning was appreciated.  A great place to stay to explore the Barossa region.  Thank you
1710462,333122532,2018-10-07,169178143,Trish,"Great place, nicely situated but very close to a noisy road."
1710462,336066752,2018-10-13,18594882,Cynthia,Shea-Oak Log Shed is a great place to stay with all of the comforts of home near the Barossa Valley.  Check in was super easy too.

1710462,339739241,2018-10-22,211097140,Simone,"Nice open space on a beautiful property. Comfortable space with everything you need. Kylie and Tom are really welcoming and thoughtful hosts.
Definitely recommended"
1710462,346247102,2018-11-08,26839878,Colleen,"Great amenities and space for 2 guests. The kitchen had everything we needed, along with some other unexpected touches. Good location providing you have a car, as it was easier to tour the Barossa Valley.  The only negative thing was that the Sturt Highway ran past the place and it took a bit to get off to sleep. Thankfully I packed some ear plugs. Pillows were the most comfortable I've had yet at an airbnb!"
1710462,346781071,2018-11-09,35679494,Matt,"Great stay and great hosts. Very clean and very cute space. Very handy for touring Barossa valley and great value for money. Great communication. Place is just of the main highway, but set amongst fields and soon to be vines and doesn’t detract from the stay at all."
1710462,347144353,2018-11-11,46347578,Jennifer,"Great, relaxing overnight stay. Clean and thoughtfully presented..even providing plenty of coffee pods. Friendly communication with hosts...thank you Kylie and Tom. Recommended!"

1710462,349579750,2018-11-17,28142739,Monik,We had a great time at your studio. The overall experience exceeded our expectation and the communication was clear and helpful right from the start. Thanks Kylie and Tom!
1710462,351433353,2018-11-22,181679594,Colleen,"Dispute the usual weather of rain, wind and cold we loved our stay.... even spent time talking and patting the lamb.
Beautiful place to stay, close to everything and was given lots of privacy."

1710462,354448375,2018-12-01,64504803,Lauren,"Kylie & Tom were really responsive and informative. Their place was very private, easy to find and had everything that we needed. We had wine and platter for dinner with local produce and breakfast and had everything we needed. The place was clean and had nice touches like soft towels and couch throws and candles."
1710462,355415193,2018-12-04,41881299,Sandy,"Pleasant stay, spacious surroundings. A bit of noise from traffic yet no big deal. NOTE: There is NO wi fi provided in the cabin which can be a problem as one has to use their own data and not everyone has unlimited data. Cleanliness needs improving."
1710462,356653635,2018-12-09,220472999,Jill,"we experienced a clean, sizeable and well presented accomodation. Everything we needed was there. Well worth it."

1710462,358549238,2018-12-14,10162034,Rachel,"Kylie and Tom’s studio was a perfect oasis following a long day’s walk. Spotlessly clean, with everything I needed for a very relaxing stay. Kylie had even left some extra food provisions for me which was a thoughtful touch. While the studio is on the Sturt Highway, it still feels like a real haven, and I would definitely consider coming back for a few quiet days to myself. I must say the lack of wifi was a real treat - a break from social media can be so refreshing...! Best wishes Kylie and Tom - I hope to visit again some time."
1710462,359467416,2018-12-17,230125727,Avril,Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Was a lovely area. Nice clean and spacious accommodation. Quite private also
1710462,359992498,2018-12-18,197630258,Trevor,"If you are looking for a modern, comfortable well appointed place to stay that is central and close to major attractions of the Barossa, then the Sheo-Oak Log Studio is the place you should stay. Definitely on our our list to revisit."
1710462,361921647,2018-12-25,37762496,Kasthoori,"we had a great stay at Kylie's and Tom's. The place is as described,  very clean and stylish. Great hub to see all the Barossa valley wineries from. Excellent commutation from Kylie to ensure we were comfortable at their place.  We really enjoyed our stay here."
1710462,362665559,2018-12-26,84805732,Jacki,Lovely place close to Barossa Valley. Has everything you’d need - I wish I’d been able to stay longer than one night! Hosts are quick with communication too which is always a plus. Thanks Kylie/Tom!
1710462,363488910,2018-12-28,23318614,Alisha,"We enjoyed a casual few days staying at Kylie and Tom's place. it was at the start of the Barossa and 15 mins drive from everything. Great space, perfect size, well stocked supplies and great air-conditioning for our super hot days."
1710462,365012847,2018-12-31,12945216,Jordan,"A really neat place in a great location. We had lunch for my partners birthday at St Hugo then took the short drive to Kylie and Tom’s place for our one night stay. A very comfortable place with great cooking amenities, and a very comfy bed!"
1710462,366609443,2019-01-03,53627553,Rebecca,"Kylie and Tom’s Studio was the perfect place to stay while exploring the Barossa region. We had everything we could possibly have needed and would highly recommend this space. 

Kylie and Tom also mentioned their work on planting new vines around the property - what a treat that will be when finished!"
1710462,367448031,2019-01-04,1552865,Chris,"we loved the studio and found it perfectly relaxing for our Barossa visit, great full sized kitchen"
1710462,368445757,2019-01-06,141976526,Chris,A lovely stay just outside the main towns in the Barossa. Excellent value overall.
1710462,401754176,2019-01-15,48444533,James,This is a wonderful place to stay as a base if you are cruising around the Barossa. We had a splendid time in this lovely accommodation.
1710462,405250688,2019-01-26,129383161,Jessica,Beautiful and peaceful accomodation in the Barossa. Great facilities and easy check in and out. Hope to stay again in the future!

Easy to find, just off the highway, with good communication and instructions."
1710462,413005748,2019-02-17,109530299,Teresa,"A great little AIRbnb, stylish accommodation and everything supplied and so close to Adelaide but also a gateway to the winery region.  Very close to Seppeltsfield Winery.  Will be back for a longer stay.  Highly recommended."
1710462,413689246,2019-02-17,202580592,Minjee,"I've stayed before, so I've stayed again this time because I liked it."

1710462,421215159,2019-03-09,101573971,Ann,Lovely country setting so close to Barossa wineries as well as bustling Gawler. Private cabin but our hosts were so prompt when we contacted them.
1710462,422363645,2019-03-11,31632323,Sabrina,Home away from home
1710462,425774223,2019-03-19,247694987,Neil,"Great value, and only a ten-minute drive from the edge of the Barossa. At only 100 metres from the highway, I thought I’d have trouble sleeping, but the noise didn’t bother me. Nicely decorated, though a few little things needed repair. The main problem was cooling down the bedroom. No wi-fi, no washing machine, but overall, not bad."
1710462,429114133,2019-03-27,9154629,Nancy,"Don’t be fooled into thinking Shea-Oak Log is too far away from the town or wineries you want to visit!  Come stay for awhile and enjoy the friendly sheep and calm country ambience.  The space was perfectly clean and tidy, the bed was extra-comfortable and delivered a superb night of rest, and the views of the valley and surrounding hillside couldn’t be lovelier."
1710462,429408198,2019-03-27,105374633,Albert,Clean and stylish but exposed to some traffic noise throughout the night.
1787389,58884569,2016-01-05,12017568,Kate,"We stayed here for 3 nights as two adults couples. This is a great apartment just off the Main Street of Tanunda. It is well appointed and clean with access to a laundry and pool which is great. The kitchen was perfect for light dinners, after big lunches in the region. 
Communication and checking in and out were easy. 
The only thing I would say, is that for international travelers, the lack of free wifi ($10/day instead) may be a drawback. Being from Australia we could use our own internet, but it seems like something that could be easily fixed. 
We would definitely stay again. "
1787389,60566666,2016-01-25,2408520,John,"What a lovely place to stay, the apartment was & loooked better than the online photos. The location was perfect, it was clean and well appointed. The only negative for me was that for the price I think the pillows could have been better. I would stay here again. 
Thank you Kym. "
1787389,62584076,2016-02-15,18795783,Helen,"This is a great apartment, spacious and well maintained.

Our rental was situated in a prime location, downtown Tanunda.  The check-in process was easy, always a plus.

I would recommend the Valley Apartments for a stay in the Barossa."
1787389,80152078,2016-06-16,12487731,Marina,"Very efficient process in order to obtain the key. 
Lovely, clean and modern apartments very central to the main street.

1787389,90569749,2016-08-01,12852497,Samantha,"The apartment was spacious, clean and well equipped. There were fresh towels and sheets and hotel-like toiletries. Kim was helpful and quick to respond to our needs. 

The apartment would have been better if there was a little bit more entertainment such as a selection of DVDs, an Apple TV (or equivalent) and some cards or board games. "

1787389,199757450,2017-10-03,117252826,Michael,Was a nice comfortable place to stay. Only two of us stayed so Apartment was too big but none the less was nice. I believe the apartment was a little bit over priced but that's just personal preference. 
1787389,202112322,2017-10-10,74753265,Rick,Great apartment
1787389,337895536,2018-10-18,217986758,Jesmond,"A well appointed and well located place close to shops, cafes and restaurants. Would stay there again, especially with a second couple."

2327616,29336940,2015-04-06,29769094,Warren,"Everything about our stay exceeded our expectations.  Our hosts were extremely friendly, hospitable and informative.  Bill even took us out to help feed the sheep on his farm!  If you're looking to stay on a peaceful farm in a homely granny flat that is just a short drive from Adelaide and Barossa Valley, Bill's place is perfect.       "
2327616,30841121,2015-04-27,27717042,Andy,Bill and Angela made us feel very welcome and were accommodating of an unexpectedly late arrival. The bungalow was comfortable and cosy and set in the midst of their large farm but close to Gawler. We enjoyed our stay.
2327616,37149302,2015-07-05,1089693,Dong,"Bill and Angela are very nice and prepared all the things we need, with sunny smile and local knowledge.

The whole family enjoyed the quiet farm, sighting the new lambs being born, sunrise. 

Great experience and thanks a lot!"
2327616,43322471,2015-08-18,9495634,Celeste,"The kindest people. Angela made sure we settled in warmly. Bill took time off work on his farm to plan our day trip. We had the honour of meeting their friends too. One of the good fellows even followed up with an itinerary for our trip to KI. 

(The sweetest dogs too. Millie came to sit with us often. Max was always ready to play.)    

The property sits within an hour from Adelaide CBD and Gawler Town, and approximately two hours to Cape Jervis (if you're heading over to KI). You will need a car and to drive on unsurfaced road to reach the farm. (Website hidden by Airbnb) The room with ensuite bathroom is fitted with a very comfortable queen bed (with electric blanket), one extra single bed, heater in both rooms, television and fridge. There were also bread, cereal, juice and milk, on top of cutlery and dishware. 

I would say the pictures are an understatement of how beautiful the property is, especially with the view outside. You will also wake up to the sheep bleating and birds chirping. The perfect getaway with wonderful hosts."
2327616,46649544,2015-09-12,43058481,Suzanne,A pleasant stay on a working farm the highlight of which was the opportunity to see a shearer in action.
2327616,48735343,2015-09-28,42234441,Catherine,"A warm and welcoming couple that we enjoyed chatting with.

A very pleasant little slice of country life, with all care taken to provide homely comforts."
2327616,55254916,2015-11-29,45178332,Will,"What a truly wonderful and relaxing experience! Bill and Angela are both delightful, the views are stunning and  Bills homemade bread in the morning just topped it off. Will definitely be back!"
2327616,58126122,2016-01-01,16888654,Denis,"Hosts Bill and Angela are congenial hosts making us most welcome on arrival and providing helpful advice in advance.
Our nine night stay, covering the final week of December, was very comfortable even with the seasonally high temps.  As listed, the unit is well appointed. The unit and it's outside seating make for a most relaxing view of an attractive ornamental garden and views extending across the fields to the hills of the nearby Barossa.
It is only a short distance of unsealed road to access the property and the reward of experiencing the comforts and hospitality offered are well worth a return visit.

2327616,61935743,2016-02-09,28337268,Julie,"Bill and Angela ( and wonder dog Max!) were fabulous hosts we arrived in time to watch some of the shearing of their stud sheep and were then shown through our self sufficient accomodation adjacent to the house in a lovely garden aspect. We had heard all about Bills home made bread from previous vistor reviews and weren't disappointed every morning a couple of large thick slices were waiting for us in the fridge, along with, jam, fresh orange juice, milk and a selection of cereals plus tea and coffee. The location was perfect for us a short drive across the main highway to Gawler and our family we came to visit but quiet enough for us who usually live in the country. Highly recommend and look forward to staying again when we next return to SA. "
2327616,74057490,2016-05-12,5901211,Maree,"Bill and Angela welcomed us warmly. Angela pointed out the location of the food and amenities that they had provided for our breakfasts. As it was late and the shops closed she suggested a local tavern where we could  get some dinner. We really appreciated Angela's advice. Bill was very busy with lambing but took time out to talk with us and explain the operations of the farm. Our flat was very cosy, clean and comfortable. We really felt ""at home""and would love to return some time. Bill's bread made for nice crispy toast!! We really enjoyed being in a country farm environment. Thanks Angela and Bill."
2327616,79067614,2016-06-11,11594164,Ip Na,"Angel and bill were so nice , we had a perfect dinner , share our story and country curtlure , we were really enjoyable , beautiful house , beautiful view ! I think I will never forget this day , thanks so much ! Hope can see u guys in somewhere again ! "
2327616,79442755,2016-06-12,64821446,Kylie,"Bill and angela are just good  decent country people that would take the shirt off their backs for you. My visit was short but amazing, they feed me at short notice after the weather turn rather horrible as i was heading out  but decided not to. Bills bread that he cooks fresh for breakfast is amazing. Wish i had more time to spend with them and would of loved to see more of there beautiful property. If im ever in the area again i would be staying with them with out a doubt. Thanks again for my lovely stay."
2327616,90807021,2016-08-02,15321985,Laura,"Thankyou Bill and Angela for being so accomodating. I had a lovely, short stay- wish it was longer! The space was clean, bed was super comfortable and there was lots of goodies provided. 
Thankyou once again for a good, carefree stay. "
2327616,106928887,2016-10-08,96651769,Karen,I am glad that I found this property and met Bill and Angela.  They made my weekend of having to work locally much more bearable.  Very welcoming and comfortable place to stay.  I hope to be back again and bring hubby with me next time for a longer stay.  Even the family dog made me feel very welcome.
2327616,124835118,2017-01-02,9126247,Kevin,"We really enjoyed our stay on the farm and Bill and Angela were excellent hosts.  They were very friendly and helpful, ensuring we enjoyed our stay.  We would really recommend this accommodation for anyone wanting a quiet country escape.  Max the dog was a real plus!"
2327616,126063428,2017-01-08,78406518,Debbie,We bad a lovely stay at Bill and Angela's. Angela was very obliging when we needed a couple of things. Thanks Bill and Angela for your hospitality. 
2327616,126831882,2017-01-14,74573435,Joel,"Had a great stay, very comfortable and clean. Hosts both very accommodating and friendly"
2327616,145568301,2017-04-18,22390318,Chris,"Bill and Angela are exceptional hosts. They made us feel at home and looked after us well. I'm a single dad with primary school age children who love farms and animals. Bill let us join in all his farm work and he was brilliant with the kids - so patient and inclusive.  We visited in time for the start of the lambing season. Bottle feeding lambs was a treat for the kids. 
The farm is absolutely beautiful. We were lucky enough to see a lot of the land and some of the old buildings made of local materials. 
Comfortable beds and quality linen had us sleeping well after our days of fun, fresh air and exercise. The cottage is very clean and was freshly painted before our visit. 
Finding the farm was easy. Bill's directions are accurate and the address is easy to find on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps also. 
We will be back for sure. "
2327616,147832333,2017-04-28,68589494,Kerry,"This place is a real get-away from everything, very relaxing and super friendly hosts. Especially good if you want to experience some farm-life. Nice B&B style, and not too far to drive for dinner etc. "
2327616,179594163,2017-08-08,22390318,Chris,This was my second visit with my kids. We loved our first visit so much the kids were begging me to go back. This place is so pretty in the winter when it's all green. Bill and Angela are wonderful hosts and made us feel very welcome once again.  
2327616,213128057,2017-11-19,102785054,Andy,Great self contained room - brought my own food which I didn't have to as there was breakfast laid on every day which I didn't use.
2327616,215819268,2017-12-01,34500288,Daisy ( Thuy),"Bill’s place was just magnificent, you get the idea of peace and serenity immediately you arrive, we will be looking forward to another stay in future."
2327616,217329726,2017-12-08,21545893,John,"Bill and Angela are fantastic hosts; they are friendly and hospitable and I found the farming operation very interesting. They look after you well with home-baked bread and condiments, and are very happy to share their local knowledge. The cottage is very comfortable with lovely views out across the countryside, and a very pleasant outdoor patio to enjoy ""sundowners"" and snacks in the evening. The trip into the northern parts of Adelaide is quick and convenient (approx 30 mins). The proximity to the Barossa is an added bonus. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb."
2327616,224691403,2018-01-04,125948660,Caitlin,Small space but perfect for 2-3 people. About 30 mins from Tanunda (main town of the Barossa Valley). They have kettle and tea/coffee but no microwave or kitchen amenities. Hosts are wonderful and very friendly and helpful :) the accommodation is on their farm next to their house but still feels private.
2327616,236317464,2018-02-19,21910251,Chantelle,We really enjoyed the location and beautiful surroundings of the property. The apartment is small but cosy. The proximity to the main house is very close but we happened to stay while the owners were away which made it very quiet and private. Unfortunately the wifi only worked for the first night and then would not work again. Also the apartment was quite dusty and had cobweb corners. But everything else was clean and tidy. The continental breakfast provided was very nice and it was nice to have our dishes cleaned up for us each day. Overall we did enjoy our stay and found it comfortable.
2327616,237672007,2018-02-23,135431348,Jacob,Great little space with beautiful views and beautiful hosts.
2327616,239702256,2018-03-02,95956096,Carla,"Bill and Angela’s hospitality was outstanding, they helped us during the stress of moving house. Their beautiful home has helped us de-stress and relax during this crazy time, fresh bread everyday and a little tour of the farm made our stay extra special."
2327616,243997510,2018-03-17,97857527,Rowena,Great location to explore the mid North from. Very friendly hosts and generous continental breakfast.
2327616,249295021,2018-04-02,79411860,Patsy,"We had an excellent experience staying at Bill's place. The place was very relaxing and provided my husband and myself a much needed break. His two dogs provided excellent pet therapy! Bill & his wife were very friendly and offered plenty of suggestions for places to eat, things to do etc. The daily provision of freshly baked bread was just the icing on the cake! We look forward to staying here again when we visit next."
2327616,254152074,2018-04-15,159127277,Sindy,So comfortable and great views

2327616,320426754,2018-09-09,46889079,Tomoko,"I stayed at their place with my 2 kids 
to visit my friend lives nearby.
They all are very beautiful, my kids could have a precious farm experience and we really loved everything.

The room is not so big, no kicthen amenity, but good enough for us, 
we had great scenery from the window and it was greater experience  for kids than to stay luxually hotel!

Will visit again!!
Thank you!"
2327616,333128440,2018-10-07,95079074,Peter,If you are staying in Angle Vale is it very close to shops and entertainment . I do recommend it.

2327616,358844749,2018-12-15,230534370,Luqman,"Great experience for a recharge. Very clean and tidy place. Max the sheep-dog is addicted to a tummy rub, so be ready to give some love and receive some."
2327616,363496317,2018-12-28,229492009,Sukitti,We had a wonderful time staying at Bill's place. We especially loved the farm tour. It was amazing! We learned a lot about sheep and farming. The room was great as well. Space greatly used. Perfect for a family or a group of friends. Super comfy beds and the shower pressure is outstanding! It definitely felt like a home away from home. And the surroundings are beautiful. Bill and Angela were such warm and welcoming host. Thank you!
2327616,367016964,2019-01-03,181401066,Wendy,"Bill's place is a lovely quiet space right next to his home but overlooking the patio, grape arbour and distant hills. Bill welcomed our young son to feed the sheep which was special. We really looked forward to going 'home' to the farm after long touristy days."
2327616,400063080,2019-01-10,29293106,Maria,"We booked this accommodation for two of our workers who needed to complete a job in the area.  The location was excellent and as far as I can ascertain, all went without a hitch with the booking.  There were no complaints from our guys and the accommodation worked out well."
2327616,400388786,2019-01-12,130962324,Isha,Excellent spot for star gazing!!!
2327616,401517794,2019-01-14,144369792,Tracy,"A cute little place with outstanding hospitality, and an excellent taste of farm life. Close enough to explore around the Barossa Valley by car. I would definitely recommend a stay with Bill & Angela."
2327616,402922463,2019-01-20,30952964,Dayna,"We stayed for 2 nights at Bill and Angela’s. My daughter said the best holiday ever and must stay place at Adelaide. Really loved farm staying, appreciated Bill and Angela’s great hospitality. hopefully we visit you sometime soon!"
2327616,408611040,2019-02-04,195775173,Brenda,Love the country setting. It was peaceful and would definitely go back if I am in the area. The host were very generous!!
2327616,413011836,2019-02-17,224624229,佳,it is really a good choice
2327616,415117543,2019-02-21,243046165,Monique,"Bill, Angela and family are fantastic hosts. They are extremely welcoming, they offer local knowledge and are great to talk to. The country home is clean, welcoming, spacious and has a real country touch to it. As an animal person I loved being able to play with the dogs each night when I got home. I would definitely recommend staying at Bill and Angela’s."
2327616,420822960,2019-03-07,39554467,Ken,"We really enjoyed staying in the guest cabin, with Bill and Angela as our hosts. They could not have been better hosts, providing us with an experience well above our expectations.
We were particularly pleased with the help Bill and Angela provided with an unexpected complication. Nothing was too much trouble.  given the property was a very busy working farm, Bill was only too happy to explain how the property operated and it has given us a more informed view of farm life in Australia.

We will happily seek to stay here again when visiting SA.

An added bonus is the two dogs we got to play with, Max and Rosi.  We thought about taking Max home with us but decided Max would miss being a sheepdog.  Bill told us that Max thinks he's a sheep dog but he's not very good at it.  Nevertheless , it was fun to see Max jump onto the hay ute each morning, chase the sheep and think he's doing a great job.  And Rosie is just a little sweetie who likes a bit of attention.

We would recommend this stay to anybody who seeks a totally different AirBnB experience in SA.

And the bread Bill makes each day for breakfast is simply the best toast we have ever had."
2567051,22607724,2014-11-10,22738488,Danya,"We spent the most fabulous weekend in the stunning Miners cottage in an idyllic setting, overlooking a beautiful creek, gum trees and teeming with indigenous wild life. 
The cottage was very well appointed with a good eye to detail and very comfortable beds. We received a warm welcome and great hospitality with a well stocked fridge and provisions, even down to home made bread . If one wants to combine a true getaway and authentic experience in the Barossa this is your answer.
"
2567051,27211222,2015-02-28,1873759,Donnie,"Rebecca and Nick are wonderful hosts. In the evening you are treated to Kangaroos just outside your door, in the morning Rebecca has all of the fixings for a wonderful farm-fresh breakfast. 

The cottage is wonderfully restored, and beautifully decorated. It's a great place to relax, or as a base to see the Barossa Valley."
2567051,27819668,2015-03-12,28893291,Wade,"Great location, great food. A pleasure to stay here, especially seeing the kangaroos on the lawn at night."
2567051,43089240,2015-08-17,38367815,Anna,Dealing with Rebecca was very easy and effortless. She was able to answer any queries I had - in a timely manner as well.

Well positioned to explore the Barossa region. A++"
2567051,51720709,2015-10-24,6564369,Clare,"We enjoyed a ""mini moon"" for a couple of nights post our wedding. The miners cottage was perfect accommodation. Beautiful outlook, enjoyed dining outside, breakfasts were amazing and the bath lovely. "
2567051,52842249,2015-11-02,8805242,Renae,"Wow what a fabulous place for a cousin retreat. We had such a lovely time. Rebecca made sure we had everything plus some for relaxing getaway.

2567051,70449764,2016-04-17,66518786,James,"10/10 weekend...
Our intentions were to have a romantic weekend away and not be tied up with a busy schedule. Upon being greeted by Rebecca when my partner and I walked into the cottage we instantly said the photos don't do it justice. Even though on the website it's a beautiful cottage the warmth and the atmosphere was amazing. 

We were greeted with decanted port, fresh eggs, chocolates, breakfast, candles, we made our own bread and enjoyed an amazing open fire place. Highly recommended and Rebecca was a great host whenever we needed. Will be staying again for sure. "
2567051,74585535,2016-05-16,7287378,Adrian,Absolutely fantastic. 
2567051,91830700,2016-08-06,47428399,Janelle,"I surprised my husband with a stay at the miner's cottage for 30th and it was perfect. We really enjoyed our stay, it was so comfortable and was a great couple of days of relaxation. Rebecca was a fantastic host, very accomodating and thought of every little detail. It is a beautiful property in Barossa Valley and we loved meeting dog, cat and goats. We would definitely recommend the cottage to others and believe rooms such as the bathroom looked better than the photos.
Great work Rebecca and family."
2567051,103694091,2016-09-23,7309519,Lis,"The cottage was beyond expectations and absolutely gorgeous. The milky way shone brightly at night, the garden grounds and birds chirped cheerily at the back, the comfortable bed was a refuge for dreams and the gorgeous bath a relaxation space in the warm bathroom. Every little detail has been thought through...including the delicious fresh bread! An incredible place to stay."
2567051,105455264,2016-10-02,78178074,David,"What a great location. Rebecca and Nick were great hosts. The cottage was very romantic. Loved the fireplace. The extra things like fresh milk, bacon and eggs, coffee machine were a bonus. Thanks guys it was great.  "

Definitely one of the most romantic getaways in South Australia. "
2567051,159384683,2017-06-11,23407621,Jessica,"The Miner's Cottage is a lovely, quiet place to stay. A bit outside of the main towns, but a really pretty area to relax and have a BBQ out back! We enjoyed the fireplace and making some fresh baked bread in the mornings for breakfast. Rebecca and Nick were really friendly and communicative - we had no troubles checking in or sorting anything that we needed. Would recommend their place for sure! "
2567051,199452702,2017-10-02,2498395,Andrea,An amazing experience! Perfectly picturesque with every imaginable comfort of a 5 star accommodation.

2567051,361612637,2018-12-24,88572037,Meghan,"Cute cottage in a gorgeous amongst nature and kangaroos!  Rebecca’s place was lovely, updated yet with the charm and character you’d hope for. And, pet friendly on top of all that!!

Breakfast came with fruit, yogurt, cereal, bacon and more. High end bathroom amenities, plush comfy bed and a beautiful, peaceful setting. Great place to getaway and de-stress. 

The only suggest I would make to future guests is to use plenty of bug repellent as there are lots of mosquitoes. (Rebecca does provide bug repellent though).

All in all, there isn’t much else I could have asked for."

2891547,33752824,2015-05-31,13282288,Georgina,"The House was perfectly presented. A very homely, luxurious feel. The  house is located perfectly to experience the best of the Barossa. Whyndham and Patricia were extremely welcoming and helpful and very friendly. Having their winery to welcome you with a tasting was a lovely touch that sets them apart from other properties on Air BnB in this area. We are coming back for the winter festival! "
2891547,34484167,2015-06-08,34229037,Stefanie,My family and I had a great weekend in the barossa made better by our accommodation. The French villa was spacious and cosy and exactly what we needed for the weekend

The house was absolutely lovely and even nicer than it looks in the pictures - it was really roomy. It's right near central Tanunda, and within walking distance to restaurants and cafes. It's also within easy driving distance to some of the best wineries and attractions in the Barossa. We highly recommend staying here if you have the chance."
2891547,49710670,2015-10-05,34786994,Chad,"My first experience using airbnb. So much better than staying at a hotel.  The hosts were fantastic and attentive and the house was perfectly located and just as described. Couldn't recommend Wyndam, Heather and their house more highly.   "

The accommodation was well appointed and eclectic with super comfortable beds."
2891547,52820041,2015-11-02,5097626,Ross,"Many thanks to Wyndham and Patricia for welcoming us to their beautiful villa.
The villa was exactly as described and photographed, comfortable, spacious with all the amenities you could wish for.
Quality throughout including bedding, towels and amenities.
The Villa is located in a quiet street, close to Tanunda town centre and a great bakery nearby.
Wyndham provided us with some great options on restaurants and dining options and the welcome at the winery was an added bonus and a great way to start our adventure in the Barossa Valley. 
Highly recommend this property."

It was comfortable, quiet and all the amenities were available. The location couldn't have been better. We were greeted with a selection of Moorooroo Park wines (at cellar door prices) which was a great introduction to the Barossa."
2891547,55656413,2015-12-04,10439792,Robyn,"Thank you 
Wyndham, Trish, Charlotte and Harriott for making our stay in the Villa so relaxing.
We were lucky enough to be able to stay for a whole week and it was lovely to be apart of the local community because of where the villa is situated, we could walk into Tanunda but also well located to all the other towns in the Barossa.
Charlottes recommendation list was a great help.
The Villa is something quite unique from the sumptuous beds and the relaxing sofa's a gourmet kitchen with all the basics. It was all we hoped for and more. We will definitely be recommending the Villa to family and friends as the only place to stay in the Barossa 
Warm Regards 
Robyn & Leica

2891547,91758770,2016-08-06,23202072,Leana,"My three girlfriends and I enjoyed 2 wonderful nights at the Winemaker's Retreat. The interior is stunning - the photos don't quite do this place justice - the antiques, rugs, prints on the wall, the marvellous kitchen... we left inspired! And the garden is gorgeous!
Wyndham and Patricia went to exceptional lengths to make us feel welcome and ensure all was well with our stay. The breakfast was delightful - especially the syrupy almond croissants - which were were fortunate to stumble across again at El Estanco on the way home so our weary, deserving spouses, (who looked after our nine kids all aged under 6 at home for the weekend) could have a small taste of our experience. The house is scrupulously clean and comfortable. We will be back! "

2891547,143003710,2017-04-09,3037680,Kerrie,We stayed at Wyndham's house for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  The location is fantastic as you are right in the middle of everything and the beds were the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  Check in and out process was easy and house was very well stocked with everything we needed.  The location was extremely quiet.  The house is on a Battle-axe block and we were in the back house.  It is very private and there are no issues or noise from the house in front which Wyndham also rents out.  We would recommend this house if you are looking for somewhere central to stay and getting a good nights sleep and a well stocked and comfortable house.
2891547,146178785,2017-04-21,3365341,William,"Wyndham's place was great, large, roomy and modern. He provided lots of breakfast stuff and generally was great. Highly, highly recommended."
2891547,146847344,2017-04-23,5772869,David,"Wyndham' place ticked all the boxes for our stay, close to all the attractions, lots of space and very comfortable. Look forward to coming back."

2891547,152902102,2017-05-19,103482076,David,"A wonderful, spacious, clean, well appointed home. Interesting ambience, delightfully presented.
Close to town, quiet, peaceful, with parking for two cars.
A home away from home. We could not recommend this accomodation more highly."
2891547,253553368,2018-04-14,33096383,Stephanie,"I cant speak highly enough of the experience we had with Wyndham and his family at Moorooroo. The check-in provided us an opportunity to visit the family cellar door (wines are a must try!!) before being escorted to the property in the town centre. The property was welcoming, super clean and well located - we had a car but you could take a short walk into Tanunda Main Street. Would highly recommend and can’t wait to come back!"
2891547,297457112,2018-07-28,44797785,Vincent,A beautiful place to stay and close to everything with everything you need.

Beds were comfortable and the house was lovely and warm. We enjoyed our stay thoroughly. "
2891547,310730996,2018-08-20,66155053,Gus And Sarah,"The Winemakers 11 is a gorgeous home in the heart of Tanunda. 

The location is perfect. We were a minute drive from the Barossa Marathon and a minute drive from the cafes and restaurants in the Main Street.

We were welcomed to the house with the heater, lights and music on. It was a welcoming touch. We loved Wyndham’s home cooked sour dough! The beds were comfy and having shampoo, conditioner and body wash available was a great touch.

We highly recommend Winemakers 11. Oh and their wine is delicious."
2891547,313761172,2018-08-26,166741045,Lauren,Beautiful space! Would definitely visit again!
2891547,317953648,2018-09-03,41960561,Zoya,"Thank you very much Wyndham and family for such a lovely stay in the Barossa! The place was spacious, beautifully kept, clean and so centrally located. We had such a comfortable stay and really appreciated the local suggestions from our hosts as well.
Also, they are winemakers and their 2014 Shiraz is definitely worth trying. We enjoyed everything about our stay."
2891547,324393822,2018-09-17,43057279,Erin,"Whydham’s place is spatious, sparklingly clean and confortble and made a great base for exploring the beautiful Barossa Valley. It’s beautifully decorated,  private and has a lovely big outdoor area too. Great to have two bathrooms for when two couples are travelling together. Whyndam was very happy for us to bring our baby (unlike some hosts) and we felt very welcome. Highly recommended!"
2891547,327485480,2018-09-24,25086137,Aesha,Amazing! Great location and hospitality!
2891547,329011545,2018-09-27,167420178,Sam,This place is truly a next level amazing place to stay in central Barossa!
2891547,333152268,2018-10-07,45620034,Patrick,We really enjoyed our stay at the Wyndham’s place. A great thank you to our hosts for the human touch and a lovely home. We left with great family memories. The hospitality touches made it truly special. Thank you so much.
2891547,341415045,2018-10-26,25177860,Jane,"This Airbnb is very comfortable and a great relaxing space. It is well equipped,  modern and very clean. This is worth a re-visit."
2891547,342576324,2018-10-29,38880884,John,"PROS: great location, quiet, spotlessly clean, comfortable beds, linen. generally good amenities. great bakery 5min walk away. pleasant hosts. nice complimentary loaf bread .
CONS: value/expensive AU$735 for 2 nights/4 persons, check in via owners own winery cellar door awkward, which is a distance and a little time consuming, they also require credit card details outside of Airbnb scope to supposedly cover any bar fridge purchase (4 bottles of their own winery wines in the fridge ? and not cheap ). House could be v. hot in summer as only fans in rooms and one aircon at other end of the house. Furniture a bit akward and uncomfortable. very limited breakfast option provided. As breakfast is ""provided"" perhaps a little fruit or cereal would be nice for non-bread breakfast guests.
   Nil complimentary bottle of anything, at this price point and in what is the premier wine region of Australia... a little tight."
2891547,344126023,2018-11-02,66728954,Sally,"The Winemakers 11 is an outstanding property. Beautifully furnished, a quiet little oasis, scrupulously clean, with everything you need for a lovely stay in the Barossa. 
We were greeted by softly playing music, calming our frazzled nerves after travelling through rush hour traffic from the airport! 
Fresh bread, butter, jam and fruit juice was left for our breakfast. 
All in all a perfect stay and thoroughly recommended."
2891547,349611656,2018-11-18,166505599,David,"Wyndham’s place is stylishly decorated, super clean and in a very handy location for a walk into Tanunda. Whilst we didn’t cook, the kitchen is well equipped if you want to whip something up with the local produce. 

We enjoyed sitting in the outdoor area  late in the afternoon after a hard day’s wine tasting. 

The drive to pick up the keys takes under 10 minutes from the centre of Tanunda."
2891547,354462921,2018-12-01,96943459,Michele,"Great location, beautiful facilities, generous spaces, immaculate and spotlessly clean, complimentary welcome gift was a lovely touch"
2891547,356664908,2018-12-09,76994311,Liz,"Wyndham's place is absolutely beautiful.  It is a perfect gem for a Barossa weekend of wine and food.  Luxuriously comfortable, incredibly cool on a 40 degree day and generous hosts that offered abundance of valuable information on the region.  We felt warmly welcomed and all queries were responded to swiftly.  
The place is within walking distance of great places to eat and shop and a short drive to some exquisite wineries.
Thanks again for providing the perfect backdrop for an absolutely fabulous girls weekend in the Barossa."
2891547,363981086,2018-12-29,48058851,Edel,"A beautiful home in the heart of the Barossa.  Spacious, thoughtfully appointed and many welcoming touches including fresh bread and all the basics for a tasty breakfast and lots of great reading on all the great wineries and activities in the area.   The air conditioning was a blessing on days that exceeded 40 degrees. Our contact Jodie was available at a moments notice - regardless of the hour!  The house is an easy walk to all the restaurants and cafes in the heart of charming Tanunda.  We could not have picked a better location or better hosts."
2891547,365917667,2019-01-01,98842230,Daniel,"Great spot, must visit, very close to town, hosts are friendly. Place is super clean and very spacious!"

3948179,42576734,2015-08-14,39245649,Nishan,"Couldn't have hoped for a better location right in the heart of the Barossa Valley in amongst the wineries. Sharon was warm and helpful. The log cabin was in an immaculate condition, spacious and clean. Free wi-fi was useable most of the time (be sure to turn your bluetooth on). Will come back here again! :)"
3948179,46713049,2015-09-13,36932692,Nicole,"What a beautiful place! Thank you Sharon for being wonderfully accommodating and assisting me through the booking process, your email communication was extremely helpful and responsive.

We all had the most wonderful time at these gorgeous cabins. There were 9 of us who stayed in two of the cabins for a two night weekend getaway. Beds were extremely comfortable, bathroom was spacious and equipped with a spa + very generous waterfall shower head. These accommodations definitely exceeded all of our expectations

One of the highlights of our stay was definitely the fire-pit, we spent two enjoyable nights relaxing by the fire whilst soaking up the beautiful outdoors. BBQ was also fantastic, we had everything we needed to cook up a storm.

We didn't get to meet Sharon until the morning of our departure, but she was incredibly warm and friendly and we will definitely be back some time in the not-so-distant future!"
3948179,57865802,2015-12-30,8242771,Kate,"Our stay in the Barossa Valley was lovely.  Sharon has created a relaxed getaway with her property in Seppeltsfield, which is centrally located to many vineyards and pretty small towns.  The cabins are basic but very comfortable and the kids had a blast at the trampoline and playground.  Thanks again Sharon!"
3948179,59164910,2016-01-07,28888924,Vibeke,"We loved your stay. Sharon welcomed us and expained everything. Then she introduced our kids to the animals: patchy the pony become they boys' best friend. We loved the cabin, the location and everything in the Barossa Valley was easy to reach.
"

3948179,87168707,2016-07-18,9137480,Tracy,"Easy to find and a beautiful area to stay.  All you need for an escape. The kitchenette meant we could cook some of the lovely food we picked up at the farmers market. Really loved the wood fire, so warm even in the middle of winter.  Close to many of the best wineries and restaurants. Hentley Farm is just down the road and a wonderful experience.  "

3948179,122611654,2016-12-24,14740200,Ksenia,"My four friends and I stayed in the cabin, it was nice and cosy, but quite tight on space, especially given that one of us slept on the fold out bed :) Sharon did provide all the details about it beforehand and we were aware of that.  The aircon came in handy on a hot Xmas Eve day. It is great location to explore the valley and we enjoyed it a lot. "

3948179,258241967,2018-04-28,179833739,Lyn,Tiny cabins with no lounge for sitting!  When I booked it said family cabin and I thought I had booked a 3 bedroom cabin with 3 double beds! Considering we had a proper cottage a few weeks before for less $$ and a much bigger place with proper dining area and lounge area etc

4551374,39790958,2015-07-26,36172687,Sarah,"My partner and I are so happy with our decision to spend the night at your cottage. 
You certainly welcomed us from the moment we stepped in, starting with the fireplace already lit so that the room was warm and cozy, to the cute welcome notes, to the loads of condiments left in the fridge and sitting on the counter and to the many options available in terms of entertainment (eg plenty of magazines and DVDs to watch).
Your cottage was immaculate and your backyard was really pretty. We definitely need to come in summer so we can make use of the BBQ and outdoor seating.
Thanks again for being wonderful hosts!"

From my first contact with Gabrielle until levering the apartment everything was absolutely perfect.
 
Decor is beautiful. Kitchen and the back of the house seems to be brand new, whilst the front of the house and bedrooms hold the old world character of the property.

Bed and linen were very high quality and comfortable.

Location was perfect. Central to everything. as well as being a 2 min walk from Kaleske tasting room and Murray Street Vineyards which was my highlight. 

Would love to return next time I visited the Barossa.

Thank you Gabrielle.

All in all, an excellent choice for your time in the Barossa. "

Well stocked with all the essentials needed for a week or weekend. 
Lovely to have airconditioning as well during the very hot weather the Barossa experiences.

4968917,30326091,2015-04-20,30125030,Kelley,"The house and location were perfect for our first (of many) Barossa experiences.   Being only a 10-15 minute drive to the downtown Tanunda area, we had ample opportunity to explore the shops and cafes in between wine tastings. The house was quite large, well-appointed and filled with lovely linens, toiletries and snacks.  The sitting room at the front was perfect for reading in the mornings and the kitchen had all the equipment we needed to make breakfasts and dinners together as a group.  

Gabrielle was easy to reach and lovely to work with - ensuring we were comfortable and had everything we needed for a perfect weekend.

Nothing has been missed, beautiful linen, comfy beds and the most amazing library of cook books!!  We cant wait to visit again, but next time for longer.  Greenock is a pretty little town with two great wineries within walking distance, local tavern great for a ""Pub"" style meal, very popular of a weekend so I would recommend booking! Our weekend came to an end with a gorgeous view of the little primary school kiddies doing their Cross Country training on the oval bathed in sunshine.....all from the kitchen bench..Very cute. "
4968917,33875595,2015-06-01,14305701,Nick,"Great place, nice country vibe and front room with books and TV. The place is close to all the nice wineries

Gabrielle made every effort for us to have an enjoyable stay"
4968917,34571458,2015-06-09,4945830,Catherine,Staying at the Bank was a real treat! Everything was on hand to make our stay so very comfortable. Gabrielle was a generous and welcoming host. Greenock was the perfect resting spot for our winery odyssey which took us bothe to the Barossa and the Clare Valley. I would definitely recommend staying here!
4968917,35134738,2015-06-15,12248246,Marnie,"What a sweet place to stay in when exploring the Barossa Valley! Beautiful, super clean house in a cute, peaceful little town that's close to everything. Comfy beds, gorgeous library room, yummy brekkie provisions left in fridge, as well as nice array of teas/Nespresso etc.  Lovely cute winery walking distance too.  Gabrielle on hand if needed. Thanks for the relaxing stay :) "
4968917,49875399,2015-10-07,33098522,Glenn,Gabrielle’s home catered for our every need and was the perfect base from which to explore the Barossa. She was a great host and thought of everything – right down to the chilled bottle of champagne in the fridge and personalised message on the whiteboard. We highly recommend it.
4968917,50516701,2015-10-12,9734260,Royston,"Great house that is very well decorated and is equipped with an the amenities that are required for a relaxing getaway in the Barossa. Gabrielle is generous to keep the house stocked with the staples and was easily contactable to ensure we had a wonderful stay.

Location is very close and suitable to access the wineries in Greenock and Seppeltsfield. 

Would highly recommend this to anyone traveling to the Barossa. "
4968917,52312416,2015-10-28,39467960,Barry,"Gabrielle was an excellent host. The house is amazing reflecting its history and character, but at the same time having all modern luxuries such a large equiped kitchen and tasteful bathroom. The location is second to none for a Barossa wine and food experience with 2 top cellar doors in the street. We had a fantastic experience and will definitely be back!"
4968917,54016173,2015-11-15,2679379,Tom,"Beautiful neighbourhood, exactly the sort of place that we expected. The little breakfast treats were a lovely surprise. Everything was perfectly clean and ready for our visit. Thank-you Gabrielle for the lovely time, will be back for sure when we visit the Barossa again!"
4968917,54729477,2015-11-23,3195757,Antonia,"I visited the Barossa with three girlfriends - arriving very late one Friday. Gabrielle was extremely welcoming, responsive on emails, and always ensured that we were comfortable. She had stocked the pantry for us and made sure the house was immaculately clean. We had a wonderful stay and would recommend this house to anyone wanting to stay in the area. "
4968917,55216158,2015-11-29,42803456,Michael,We had a great experience in a very unique setting. We felt very privileged to have stayed where we did.
4968917,57680039,2015-12-28,24347738,Ceri-Anne,"What an incredible house! We absolutely loved our stay over Christmas. Couldn't get over the kitchen and the library full of amazing cook books! Christmas dinner washed down with a beautiful Barossa Shiraz was a devine, particularly as we were able to enjoy it outside on the back patio in the shade.

The house is beautiful and as a Brit the smell of old wood floors, fireplaces and high ceilings reminded me of home. 

Gabrielle was a delight to deal with and incredibly welcoming. 

Thank you for the most fab stay!

We will be back and recommending to our friends and family."
4968917,58520030,2016-01-03,7061171,Joel,"We stayed at this Greenock property for 4 days.  It was a great base from which to explore the vineyards and towns of Barossa Valley.  The village is quaint and quiet, yet close enough to everything.  There is at least one great vineyard within walking distance (Murray street - try their Voignier!)  The local tavern has good food (just don't order the pizza).  The property itself is great, with a great well equipped modern kitchen connected to a nice outdoor space.  The owner also left us a few treats which was a nice touch.  The 3 bedrooms were all equipped with comfy beds.  There's also a nice library/tv room with a good leather sofa to relax after a full day's wine tasting.  If we're ever back in BV, we'd love to return. "
4968917,59329168,2016-01-09,45646918,Rita,"The house is well located within Barossa Vally with easy drive to all wineries. It has 3 bedrooms, a library and a nice well equipped kitchen/living. We only needed one room and can imagine the house will be well suited famililes with children, or groups. The host communicated well with us for instructions for keys, access etc. "
4968917,59561793,2016-01-12,21747341,Holly,"Sal, do u think this review for the Barossa house is suitable?:

Gabrielle was the perfect (behind the scenes) host for our 3 night stay at Barossa Bank Great Escape.
The house was just perfect! - clean and very comfortable, good sized bedrooms, inviting kitchen/family living, a beautiful and unique library room, a new bathroom/laundry and a large space outside. The house was left for us with a well stocked fridge and pantry and was a really lovely 'home away from home'.  
I would highly recommend this house and Gabrielle's hospitality."
4968917,60826835,2016-01-28,17231166,Angela,"The Great Escape is just that! The original building has been beautifully furnished and you could spend your entire trip in The Library. The kitchen and bathroom are modern and have all the equipment and utensils you could possibly need. The pantry & fridge have all the staples which is just fantastic. 
The entire house is air conditioned, a real welcome as most days we were there the temperature was in the mid 30s!
Gabrielle was the perfect host - answered any question very quickly and arrival instructions very clear.
A perfect position to explore the Barossa!
We loved it!"
4968917,65563637,2016-03-15,57468018,Kate,"Our host Gabrielle was super organised, very attentive and really lovely. She helped to organise a cot for our baby and even left us fresh bread and milk.
The single only downside to our stay was that the house hadn't been used recently and was musty from being locked up which gave my son asthma. Otherwise the stay was lovely, and the library collection of gourmet cookbooks was to die for."
4968917,67409207,2016-03-29,22170709,Peter,"
We had a fabulous stay in the Barossa at Gabrielle's home.  The house is located in a small village with excellent access to all the local wineries.  The house is very well appointed- Gabrielle has thought of everything!  It was particularly thoughtful to leave us provisons for breakfast given it was Easter weekend and many of the local stores were shut.  We loved the library full of cookbooks and enjoyed relaxing at home after a full day in the wineries.  Our only issue was lighting the fire in the lounge-we smoked the house out. It didn't detract from our wonderful weekend but we felt bad leaving the house a little smokey!
Gabrielle was extremely easy to deal with and very flexible with check in and out. We would recommend a stay here."
4968917,71458211,2016-04-25,10924244,Brian,Perfect place to explore the Barossa Valley. Comfy beds and well appointed kitchen. Fruit and bread and eggs supplied were a lovely surprise. Highly recommend booking in to Hently Farm for dinner or lunch while you visit.
4968917,72290520,2016-05-01,43236792,Olivia,"We really enjoyed our stay in Greenock, its a lovely little village with a cute cafe opposite the house and some tennis courts behind which were a welcome break from all the wine! The house itself is full of old world charm with very comfy beds and a lovely open plan kitchen area. We enjoyed playing cards in the library area. Highly recommend."
4968917,73329570,2016-05-08,16788781,Sam,"The Bank was a wonderful place to stay. We had seven of us staying for a week, and there was plenty of room. 

The house is immaculately presented, with beautiful bedrooms, a great library, and a well stocked kitchen and pantry with everything you could possibly need. 

The location is also great, being no more than 2 minutes walk from two cellar doors (Kalleske's, Murray Street Vineyards), a great local pub, and a brewery across the road. 

We would undoubtedly stay here again. 

Our recommendations from the week in the Barossa include:
- lunch/dinner at Hentley Farm - extraordinary, indulgent experience especially with matched wines (although not cheap)
- dinner at FermentAsian - amazing food, great and very reasonably priced wine list, try the  7 course special with matched wines
- lunch or a cooking course at Casa Carboni in Angaston - stunning Italian food and wine and great coffee, Fiona and Matteo are great hosts
- a pub dinner in Greenock
- best cellar doors:
Murray St Vineyard
Yelland and Papps
Rockfords
Turkey Flat
Tscharke's (do the $15 tasting downstairs in the cellar - epic)
Hentley Farm
Yalumba
Peter Lehmann

That's only just scratching the surface, there is plenty more to see and do, and The Bank is a great place to see it from. Thanks Gabrielle!
"
4968917,74480000,2016-05-15,39646085,Olivia,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at the Barossa Bank. Convenient access, clean and tidy, many modern amenities including a coffee machine, lovely shower, excellent kitchen with good quality pots and pans etc., and a very comfortable library/ lounge area. With a family of adults we appreciated the comfortable queen size beds in all rooms. 

The tavern, wineries and brewery in close walking distance were all great, and there's an excellent cafe just up the road. Many other wineries in close driving distance. Overall the quality of the accommodation was excellent, we would thoroughly recommend the old bank. "
4968917,75646169,2016-05-22,65512172,Noel,"Gabrielle was a very welcoming and helpful host.  Prior to our arrival Gabrielle was very responsive to a number of emails I sent her clarifying our accommodation and activities/attractions in the area.  Our lodging was in a beautiful old bank which was well appointed and easily accommodated our group of six.  One of the key features of the house was the library in the front room that contained at least four large bookshelves packed with interesting reading.  The old bank is situated in one of the town's main streets however it is very quiet.  We found the location to be perfect to explore  the Barossa region's wineries, restaurants and other attractions.  All six of our group thoroughly recommend this property and are greatful for Gabrielle's efforts "
4968917,79575461,2016-06-13,55206460,Jessica,"I travelled with a group of 7 for a weekend away in the Barossa, Gabrielle's house was the perfect accommodation choice. Very close to all the Barossa wineries and even in the same street as Murray street winery, which was fantastic and only a short walk! There is also a lovely cafe and pub on the same street, all in walking distance. 

The home itself is amazing. Beautiful decor, a great history, and every amenity you could want. While we didn't meet Gabrielle, she was the perfect host and even provided us with suggestions for our trip. 

I cannot recommend Gabrielle or the The Great Escape more highly. The accommodation made our long weekend away and I will definitely recommend to anyone traveling to the Barossa area. I hope to come back one day! "
4968917,83662604,2016-07-03,6975434,Santosh,"A beautiful house located in the heart of Barossa valley with some amazing wineries within a short distance. We were a group of 5 adults and one infant who stayed over for the long weekend.

The 3 bedroom house was fully furnished with a modern kitchen ( and a full pantry) and a beautiful outdoor. 

Gabrielle was a great host who organised a crib for my boy and was very friendly to deal with.

Thanks for the stay and definitely recommended!"
4968917,90165401,2016-07-31,61478802,Elizabeth,"We enjoyed a lovely, peaceful stay in the Barossa. The house was beautiful and well stocked with an assortment of teas and coffee, as well as breakfast stores."
4968917,94049937,2016-08-14,3180912,Anne-Marie,Our group of 6 adults spent a weekend at Gabrielle's house. The house was clean and comfortable with a lovely modern bathroom and kitchen. It is well located to wineries and a short taxi ride from both Fino and Hentley Farm restaurants. The house is in the main street of Greenock and it is a few minutes walk from the local hotel and also Cafe El Estanco for breakfast.
4968917,96828191,2016-08-24,70142784,Matthew,"A great place which is close to the pub and brewery. Greenock is a lovely and quiet little town with freely locals. Very neat, clean and very well stocked with everything you need. We will be back!"
4968917,97812208,2016-08-28,90186329,Tim,"As i was travelling to the Barossa Valley for the first time and was taking my lovely wife and her mother we had a few pre-requisites about the accommodation we chose with one being accessibility. The fact that the Bank met our basic requirements was great, but everything else was simply fantastic. The attention to detail, obviously gained from Gabrielle's experience was astounding. In my mother in laws own words ""i could live here for ever"" (the thought of leaving her may have crossed my mind), i think it says it all. We did only stay a couple of nights, but would have loved it to be longer. I just wanted to spend a day curled up on the couch going through the books in the library. Thanks Gabrielle for a great weekend, and sorry we did drink almost all of the coffee!!"
4968917,104508284,2016-09-26,12461260,Shontell,"We were made to feel very welcome, we arrived to a beautifully clean and well equipped cottage. We were amazed at the supplies that Gabrielle had left for us, it truly made for a beautiful weekend."
4968917,106026137,2016-10-03,4301299,Marg,"The Barossa Bank is an ideal location for a holiday in this s beautiful region. The house is comfortable, well appointed and with plenty of space. There were also provisions for breakfast. It felt warm and welcoming. 
We also love Greenock and visited Kalleske and Murray St Vineyard wineries as well as Barossa Brewery, the pub and the excellent El Estanco cafe. 
All highly recommended. 
It was a memorable weekend thank you. "
4968917,108716840,2016-10-17,11217671,Daina,"What a beautiful place! Gabrielle was a fantastic host and couldn't have asked for a nicer place to stay for a weekend getaway. We had 7 adults in our group and it was very spacious and comfortable for sleeping and entertaining both inside and outside.  Greenock is a quiet place to base yourself in the Barossa but has everything you need... a great cafe, tavern and wonderful wineries close by. We would definitely stay again!"
4968917,111415723,2016-10-31,2151120,Caroline,"A group of us, from Melbourne, headed to Barossa Valley for a wedding. 

Gabrielle's place was perfect - well-appointed, clean and spacious. The bedrooms were comfortable and the library wonderful. Check in and out was easy and fuss free. 

The breakfast provisions (eggs, bread, milk, butter, fruit, coffee and tea) and pantry items were just perfect. 

We visited a few wineries and also the farmers market during our stay - all was in easy driving distance and there's a few places worth visiting that you can walk to too, as others have mentioned in their reviews. 

I would gladly stay again, and recommend Barossa Bank Escape to anyone who is considering it. 

Thank you Gabrielle for having us!"
4968917,112336134,2016-11-05,25292668,Maria,"The home is within a lovely location  with walking distances and/or short distances to some wineries. Perfect location to unwind and enjoy the tranquility and landscape.
Gabrielle made us feel welcome, provided  personalised messages and payed particular attention to details.
The home is absolutely a treasure, spacious rooms, well decorated, maintained and greatly stocked. Overall, my friends and myself enjoyed every moment.
Thank you Gabrielle for such amazing experience. 
Best Regards

The located is excellent and very easy to drive to cellar doors and towns. There are many helpful travel information and maps in the house, which helped us more easy to plan our trip. 
Thank you again, Gabrielle. "
4968917,135365152,2017-03-04,5728613,Pei,"What a lovely, quiet, and clean house to stay in for the 3 days/2 nights that we were there!  Gabrielle was a fantastic, welcoming host, and though we didn't meet her, communication lines were always open, and check-in was a breeze.  The little touches were much appreciated - provisions, toiletry items, visitor information near the entrance - and we were truly grateful that Gabrielle was able to accommodate our early check-in as our flight landed at dawn.  Location-wise, many wonderful wineries are within a 15-min drive or less... you really cannot do better!! Now just a couple of points to mention, both of which didn't take away from our stay at all, but should be noted. There's only one shower/toilet, which *may* pose a slight problem if you have 3 couples traveling together; it didn't bother us as it was just the two of us.  Also the bed in the room that we slept in did move around a bit - probably best to pick the room with a proper bed frame near the entrance if you're violent toss/turners like we are!!  Overall, we couldn't have been happier with our choice of accommodation...thank you so much Gabrielle!"
4968917,136992648,2017-03-12,110389843,Paul,"Great house, great location and great host! "

4968917,147137169,2017-04-25,86947962,Mat,"We had a lovely stay at the Grape Escape! Lovely historic building but with all the creature comforts. The place was immaculately clean and the location was great, walking distance to the local pub, a great little cafe and wineries. Highly recommend."
4968917,149998985,2017-05-06,9529116,Amy,Gabrielle's place is gorgeous. Check in was very smooth and Gabrielle was great at communicating.  She even provided things for breakfast!

4968917,155300562,2017-05-28,127285249,Melissa,"Gabrielle's place is a lovely house to stay outside of the bigger country towns.  It is nicely located to visit the surrounding area, with a pub merely a few minutes walking distance away for dinner or an easy 10-15 minute taxi ride to Tanunda."

Walking distance to the local pub, brewery, cellar door general store and great small bar/cafe. The local oval is just behind the house which was great free some fresh air and some exercise. Greenock is a quiet central town to explore the Barossa Valley and surrounds.
Definitely worth considering if you are looking for a 3 bed stay in the Barossa Valley."
4968917,222457226,2017-12-29,21183765,Kathleen,House was wonderful and incredibly well stocked with everything you need plus lots of thoughtful extras. Gabrielle great to deal with.

It was so homely, and we instantly settled in. 
Gabrielle was lovely to deal with, even organising a portacot and high chair for our little one. 

The house is full of so much information about things to do in the area, it was super handy to have brochures and maps on hand. 

The village of Greenock is just Devine. So friendly and quaint. It was nice to be away from a busy town, but amazingly close to some of the Barossa’s best vineyards! 
We will be back for sure! 
Thanks for everything!!"
4968917,364592083,2018-12-31,4534764,Mark,"Great location (as others have mentioned).  The photos are accurate and the place is pretty big.

4990447,32423243,2015-05-17,1940313,Tiffany And Adam,Milk and Honey is a great house in a beautiful quiet part of the Barossa. The house is an elegant combination of new and old. It is spacious whilst still remaining cosy. We travelled with our 2 year old daughter. The house would be great for families or ideally 2 couples using it as a base to explore the area.
4990447,49901679,2015-10-07,2791752,Joel,"Milk and Honey House was perfect. Comfortable and relaxing from the moment we stepped through the door. It really was the perfect base for our Barossa Valley adventures.

Loved that the fridge was stocked with essentials, a really nice touch. Great location on a quiet street with wineries and restaurants all within a short drive, the Barossa is beautiful, we highly recommend visiting."
4990447,62006745,2016-02-10,5273034,Cass,"The listing was as Kirstie had described and the neighbourhood was peaceful and quiet. The house was fully equipped and Kirstie was so kind to leave us with provisions for breakfast. Our one hiccup during the stay was wifi access which we didn't get but after talking to Kirstie, she assured us that it's a work in progress.  Everything about Milk & Honey was perfect! We would highly recommend it and we look forward to returning and recommending it for all our friends. "

The house itself was absolutely beautiful - a perfect, clean, tidy, bright, quiet little cottage just moments from Angaston and surrounding wineries. Kirstie also left us a bottle of wine, some almond biscotti, and breakfast provisions which was very nice. We would highly recommend this home to others and hope to be back one day! Thank you again Kirstie for your hospitality! :) "
4990447,126318354,2017-01-10,10518030,Dani,Stunning property. Warm with natural rustic country finishes. No detail is overlooked. You can feel the love.
4990447,159900779,2017-06-12,127978949,Linda,"We felt like we were at home the moment we walked through the door of Milk and Honey. It was exceptionally clean and beautifully decorated, with lots of little extras thrown in (coffee machine, toiletries, wine and breakfast provisions, etc). The location was spot on for our weekend in the Barossa, peaceful but central for all amenities and wineries. And although the nights were chilly, the heating throughout kept us cosy and warm. We did not want to leave and will definitely be back."
4990447,207745839,2017-10-29,21626962,"Tanya, Binny & Georgie",This is the most appealing and most stylish space we ever stay in and the host is the most caring and dedicated host committed to ensuring her guests have the best experience possible.  The home is immaculate and the amenities just first class.
4990447,209230721,2017-11-04,17693174,Jess,Beautiful cottage style home! We had a wonderful stay with another couple - loved spending some nights in at the house. Great communication and easy check in. Kirstie was kind enough to leave us some locally made treats which were very much appreciated! Would recommend the farmers market on Saturday nearby. Great stay!
4990447,212669198,2017-11-18,91549549,David,"The accommodation is very good.  Kirstie's communication was timely and very clear and helpful.  The rooms are very comfortable, clean and tidy.  It was great for a couple spending time in the Barossa and we really enjoyed it.  Mobile phone reception was an issue during our stay.  
Will stay here again !"
4990447,248659506,2018-04-01,6905594,Kara,"Milk and honey is lovely! It’s nice and cozy, the layout and decor make it very homely and comfortable. It’s a great base to come back to after exploring the surrounding areas; Kirstie has booklets, pamphlets and magazines available which offer extra info on activities happening in the Barossa which was also helpful. We very much enjoyed staying at Milk and Honey (it really is a beautiful space) and will be recommending it to friends and family visiting the area!"
4990447,275413627,2018-06-11,1013348,Jen,Such a gorgeous place! We had 2 couples stay for 4 nights over winter and there was plenty of space for us all. The hearing is fantastic especially through the cold winter nights. Highly recommend it!
4990447,359444258,2018-12-16,15106891,Luise,"Beautiful home, with great amenities. So much space to move around in, and was the perfect home away from home. A little drive away, and you can experience the best that the Barossa has to offer. I used the home as a bridal wedding preparation spot, and it was a dream for my photographer team, and gave me the tropical oasis feel I was searching for. Loved it, and I would definitely stay again!"
5185834,29234824,2015-04-05,4317544,Matt,"A professionally run, well-appointed, comfortable cottage stacked with provisions in the heart of the Barossa was a perfect getaway for us both over the Easter holiday period.  Thanks so much."
5185834,39425831,2015-07-23,37531152,Jasmine,"Loved Trinity cottage, great views of the Barossa valley especially sunset was quiet romantic. Location was ideal, close to allot of wineries by car thou, it was vey easy to get around. We did not met our host Kim but the cottage was clean and full of everything that we needed for our stay, thank you so much for the wine, it was very relaxing drinking it next to warm wood fire. This cottage was a perfect romantic getaway!! I definitely will visit again soon. "
5185834,49782759,2015-10-06,2255724,William,"Trinity Cottage was amazing: secluded but not too far away from the wineries, restaurants and towns of the Barossa; simple yet modern in just the right way; and filled to the brim with food, utensils and anything else you could possibly need. We loved our stay here and definitely did not want to leave. "
5185834,56117490,2015-12-09,21204187,Ian,"The highlight of our trip was our stay at Trinity Cottage. Far enough from town to feel secluded but close enough to make getting around easy. The View overlooking the vinyard is sublime and the perfect place to sample your purchases after a day touring the wineries. However, what really made the difference was the extra little unexpected touches like a ready stocked fridge and bathroom. We also lost a bracelet which Scott and Kim managed to have back to us by the time we arrived home"
5185834,58590494,2016-01-03,8151882,Evelyn,"We stayed at Trinity Cottage for a week and had an amazing time. The cottage is in a quiet, secluded area which was a much needed relief from busy lives, but also a short drive into town and heaps of fantastic wineries.

The house is in great condition and had everything you could need, including all the comforts of home and breakfast provisions! 

Would definitely recommend staying  here as we will next time we're in the Barossa. 

11/10!"
5185834,64884254,2016-03-08,25608159,Rebecca,"So pretty watching the sunset from the front porch overlooking the vines. It's a delightful cottage which stayed cool during the days despite the heatwave conditions outside. So many little treats left for us by the owner. Very private and secluded. 

We had a delightful and romantic time and really enjoyed our stay."
5185834,79788586,2016-06-14,53745983,Charmaine,"Perfect cottage in a beautiful location stacked with almost enough local produce you don't need to leave the fire - except for wine! The owner, Scott, was extremely helpful and friendly and made himself available for a few house questions. Can't recommend this cottage enough, enjoy!"
5185834,138084008,2017-03-18,47728971,Dan,Perfect place for a weekend escape to the Barossa. 
5185834,144135268,2017-04-14,101903299,Stewart,A fantastic cottage to stay in for a week long retreat to the Barossa. Great beds and a well stocked kitchen with plenty of wonderful food provided for many breakfasts. This places has the most amazing views of sunsets over the nearby vineyards. Highly recommended if you want something with a little character.
5185834,146172192,2017-04-21,86594276,Susan,"What a gem of a find!  This cottage reminded me of my childhood growing up in rural Qld.  The cottage was immaculate and had everything and more you could wish for.  So much was supplied and the best farm fresh eggs ever.  Everything from milk, juice, bacon, port, biscuits, wine you name it and it was supplied.  The cottage is extremely private and quiet and just what we needed for a week away from reality.  Restaurants and wineries are a small drive away.  I met the friendliest people in the Barossa Valley and what a community as they all support each other.  We loved Lambert Winery not too far away.  I would not hesitate recommending this cottage to anyone.  Hope to revisit again soon."
5185834,153351472,2017-05-20,16937247,Luke,"Amazing cottage. Incredible, location. Loved waking up to the birds with a cup of tea, looking out to the vineyards in peace and quiet. My partner and I can't wait to go back ❤️"
5185834,210939874,2017-11-11,78951249,Ryan,"Wonderfully cute cottage that is perfect for a couple or two couples! 
Quaint, relaxing and lovely"

5185834,272046714,2018-06-03,121455625,Matthew,What a great cottage nicely secluded amongst the Barossa Valley but only 5mins from Angaston. The hospitality and amenities provided including food and other little treats was amazing. Definitely recommend this gem for ant getaway to the Barossa Valley.

5185834,351436163,2018-11-22,12486899,Courtney,"This cottage is so cute & cozy, we really enjoyed our stay. We arrived after getting caught in the rain & were freezing- having the fireplace prepped to be lit was the most beautiful touch. The food provisions were very generous (eggs, milk, bread, tomatoes, mushrooms, juice, yoghurt, biscuits,etc)-exceeded our expectations!! We also thoroughly enjoyed the bottle of Bethany wine that was left for us.   We hadn’t heard of Bethany before, but liked it so much we found the winery & stocked up with some bottles for our trip home. 

The country cottage feel helped us really relax on our holiday. This is one of the best & most professional Air BNB places we’ve stayed."
5185834,401756967,2019-01-15,36462122,Michael,Excellent accommodation.  We really enjoyed our stay so peaceful.  Would recommend.
5185982,32513950,2015-05-19,30084957,Julia,"This property was a real delight, great space and was a perfect spot for our trip to the Barosssa. Great location to get to the wineries and some great restaurants within a 10 minute walk. A very lovely touch was provision of breakfast food which was greatly enjoyed and appreciated.
The key collection and check out was so easy.
All in all a great property, would highly recommend!"
5185982,34581550,2015-06-09,25535469,Bianca,Such a wonderful home - it was everything we wanted it to be and more! Definitely recommended and will definitely return. 4 stars 
5185982,55350209,2015-12-01,39211748,Elleisha,"Kim is an excellent host and his house was spacious, beautifully presented and absolutely immaculate.
 I highly recommend staying at Lochnagar.  Thank you for you the bacon and eggs in the fridge - that was a pleasant surprise and definitely helped ease our sore heads from all the wine consumed the night before. Once again thanks for everything Kim and apologies for the disorganisation on my end! "
5185982,82535559,2016-06-28,13331935,Tash,The house was absolutely beautiful. Having the heating on for when we arrived at 1am in the morning and breakfast provided was extra special. So close to wineries and the main town. Would definately stay here again! 
5185982,96575121,2016-08-23,39677746,Emma,"We had a great stay at Kim's house this weekend. Perfectly located in close proximity to some amazing wineries, the house is beautifully decorated and set up with really comfy beds! We were also left loads of food for breakfast which was really generous. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay there. Thank you! :-)  "
5185982,159876477,2017-06-12,12101010,Carla,"This is a fantastic house. Very spacious and clean. The kitchen was well stocked, the hosts thought of everything. Would definitely stay here again."

5185982,192685015,2017-09-10,139756653,Ruth,"We have been travelling to the Barossa almost yearly since 2001 and finding suitable accomodation has always been a challenge when travelling in a group.  This house was perfect for three unrelated adults/ couples each able to have their own room and bathroom with a communal area to eat.  The kitchen was well stocked with crockery, glasses and equipment.  The breakfast provisions were also very good.  The flavour of the tomatoes were sensational.  Overall this has been our best experience so far.  We will use again"
5185982,208547132,2017-11-02,150597637,Diana,"Very comfortable, and a good base for us while we were in the area!"
5185982,330712522,2018-10-01,52216946,Austin,"We enjoyed our stay, the house and yard is nice and the breakfast supplies were generous. A few small things could be improved, there is a note about internet usage being limited and having to unpack and repack the outdoor furniture in the garage was more work than I’d have preferred. I would stay here again."
5289072,52133158,2015-10-26,25080800,Niusha,"A spacious house set on a hill overlooking the valleys and majestic gums. Perfect base to explore the hills, we stayed with 5 of us, 2 couples and a single, and it was ideal for us.
Well appointed throughout, comfortable beds, we'll be back."
5289072,54019796,2015-11-15,19433775,Kae,"My family and I (5 people) had an awesome time up at this residence. It was the true Barossa experience we were wanting... being in the middle of nowhere with all the scenery!
Phillip was very hospitable even before we got there and made sure we were comfortable throughout the whole stay.
We had the whole place to ourselves and it was truly relaxing. We would sleep to the sounds of the sheep, and wake up to the birds chirping.
The house had everything we needed plus more... plenty of space!
We definitely know where we'll stay again when we return to the Barossa.
This place is highly recomended. "
5289072,63350554,2016-02-22,5396634,Jo,"My family and I (5 of us) had such a great time staying in the Barossa at Phil's place! Phil met us at the house and quickly showed us around, and pointed us in the direction of some travel guides which had recommendations of the area. 

The house was well equipped with everything you need for preparing a meal with everything you pick up at the nearby Farmer's Markets. The rooms were comfortable and there was plenty of space for everyone. We would definitely go back!

No drawbacks at all, but given the location if you're staying here you'll definitely want a car. We booked knowing this, and made plenty of use of my parent's car. That said - there are lots of wine tour guides that will pick you up too :) "
5289072,64358185,2016-03-03,53360034,Adrian,"We enjoyed our stay immensely, the property was clean and suited our needs. Phil was super helpful and very welcoming. Would recommend as a great base for exploring the barossa."
5289072,67411095,2016-03-29,53918241,Jules,"The house was perfectly equipped for us and Phil was very helpful. It was a great location being a bit off track for quiet times in the countryside and then to head in wine tasting. Great value for money, thoroughly enjoyed our visit. "
5289072,67880938,2016-04-01,57488252,Lily,"My friends and I stayed at this beautiful property for a bit of R&R during our Dragon Boat racing. It was exactly what we expected, nice quiet retreat to get away from it all but very handy to explore the wineries in this region. One of my friends accidentally left a bag of clothes behind and Phillip was kind enough to bring it back to him in the city. Wonderful place to stay, loads of room, everything you would need or want."
5289072,69123378,2016-04-09,63681255,Stefan,"Our final day at Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm summed up our experience = NO ONE WANTED TO LEAVE!!! We were all too comfortable, too relaxed, & too 'at home'. Having the whole home to ourselves (4 people) was a spacious treat. Everything was available for use (bathroom & kitchen) - we really didn't need to bring anything along in advance. The isolated & rustic environment transpired into a peaceful & tranquil existence after each day's hard work sampling wine, cheese & treats in the Eden & Barossa Valleys! Very pleased we stayed here, rather than on a main road or in a busier urban area. The property caters for all ages & would be ideal for a family - sheep, kangaroos, abundance of bird life & I even thought I saw a rabbit! Highly recommended."
5289072,70755471,2016-04-20,11219021,Ruth,"Thankyou very much for a lovely stay in your spacious home.
We loved the extensive views, sense of isolation, prolific birdlife and proximity to the Lavender Federation Trail (our aim of completing the Springton to Truro section was easily met).

The house was clean, comfortable, and very generously supplied with everything one could possibly need/want.

It was lovely to meet Mary (and discover we had been fellow walkers many many years ago!)

"
5289072,71467687,2016-04-25,1623747,Sue,Phillip and his wife met us on arrival abs showed us around the house. They made us feel very welcome and the house was lovely. Plenty of space which was great with 6 of us sharing. The surrounds were peaceful but not too far from anywhere in the Barossa. The bird life in particular was a delight for me. We would definitely stay again.
5289072,71727791,2016-04-28,11530317,Natasha & Michael,"Despite our late arrival, Mary was gracious enough to wait for us patiently and provide us with helpful information about the location. The property is beautiful and the home is welcoming, spacious and well looked after. "
5289072,72185675,2016-05-01,65995774,Penny,"This beautiful Mt McKenzie property is the perfect retreat - spacious rooms with plenty of natural light, modern kitchen and bathrooms, comfortable beds, outdoor seating areas to enjoy the sunshine and an incredible view. Phil is very helpful and welcoming. It's an easy drive to Barossa towns and wineries. My friends and I loved our stay and left feeling refreshed and relaxed. We highly recommend this property."

5289072,81519948,2016-06-23,17622932,Shannon,"We loved our time at the Mt Mckenzie raspberry farm. Phillip was very easy to communicate with and friendly. He greeted us on arrival, was very welcoming and introduced us to what we needed to know about the log cabin. The pictures are an understatement to the beauty that surrounds this property and we were happy to share the experience with the wildlife. Apart from this, the cabin is well equipped with everything you need. Excellent fire and a homely feel! The nearest town Angaston is also a treat and only ten minutes down the road with nice restaurants, a grocery store and a the famous Barossa cheese company shop. A relaxing getaway in a beautiful region! Thanks again Phillip! Much appreciated! :)"
5289072,82998151,2016-06-30,67290287,Scott,"We were met by Mary, who did an excellent job of telling us about the place and the surrounding areas including some great wineries.

The place was tidy and clean and well equipped. It is very large and comfortable. As the pictures show, it's in a beautiful setting."
5289072,86291619,2016-07-15,57681208,Ingrid,Phil was there to greet us when we arrived and helped us via a phone call when we got lost! He had the fire going and gave us some helpful advice about some of the local wineries

The property is wonderful; beautiful views and very comfortable, so much so that we felt no need to leave during our stay...and we probably wouldn't have, had the attractions of the Barossa not been so accessible. We will definitely return!"
5289072,95667019,2016-08-20,30737133,Han,Phil was very friendly and prompt in all his communications. The place was exactly as is in the pictures!  views and surrounds were beautiful. Gorgeous property and a very good price for the Barossa. Wouldn't definite stay here again!
5289072,99119239,2016-09-03,6470019,Eric,"We had a great stay! Phil made us feel very welcome. The location was very picturesque and peaceful but also quite close to Angaston, great restaurants and wineries. The house facilities were great and very cosy with the wood burning stove. "
5289072,101155766,2016-09-12,71621807,Sharyn,"Raspberry Farm is a stunning location. Guests are met with magical views across the valley, an abundance of bird and wild life and an utter sense of tranquility.

The house itself is very comfortable, tastefully designed and well equipped with everything you may need for a getaway. "
5289072,103883232,2016-09-24,11491693,Jacquie,"We arrived on Monday afternoon and were met by Mary who welcomed us and showed us around her lovely home.   The home was so clean, fresh and very warm with the log fire going.  Our host was always quick to get back to us with any questions we had, and his directions to get there were spot on. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook each night, everything was easy to find. The farm was a lovely base to come back to as we toured around the Barossa or just going for long walks during the day.  Evenings were spent around the fabulous dining table where our family just spent the night talking away, it really felt like home.  We really did get value for money and this is a place that we would love to return to one day and it was sad to leave on the Saturday. It really was a perfect place for the six of us just to enjoy, relax and spend time together. Our family wholeheartedly recommends staying at the Mt McKenzie Raspberry Farm.  Thanks to Phillip and Mary."
5289072,111330979,2016-10-30,89786189,Jay,"This is a very spacious cabin suitated within a beautiful surroundings. Getting up in the morning and having breakfast at the dining table over looking the surroundings is a wonderful experience. There was a friendly kangeroo roaming in the yard too. If we werent so busy running around the Barossa visiting wineries, it would have been a wonderful place to have a relaxing slow day and have a BBQ and relax.
Phil was there waiting for us on time (we were 10min late) on the arrival date.
We are very pleased with the place"
5289072,112677958,2016-11-06,62999061,Laura,It was a lovely getaway with a lovely view and really enjoyed our stay. We stayed with another couple and there was plenty of space.  I would highly recommend this place to others. 
5289072,113277325,2016-11-11,60429440,Peter,Raspberry farm is set a short way up a dirt road in the idyllic BarossaValley. Mary met us and showed us the well set up house and fabulous kitchen. Everything was exactly as described including the beautiful views across the valley.

We had three couples in total and we felt at home, surrounded by beautiful scenery and a fully catered to kitchen, which allowed us to cook our own meals. Other than the beautiful sounds of nature, there were no noisiness from passing cars or commuters. A highly recommended place for a quiet getaway. "

5289072,205315913,2017-10-22,147741683,Nerida,An amazing house in a great location not to far from Angaston with a great outlook. 
5289072,207807098,2017-10-30,5710893,Rhea,"Phillip is a lovely host and made us feel very welcome. This cottage is set beautifully in the hills of the Barossa Valley, not far from a small town with nice restaurants and shops, and many, many vineyards! Also very close to the Collingrove Hill Climb Track. 

It is just as described, cosy and welcoming. It was lovely waking up to the sounds of wildlife. Highly recommend it!"
5289072,209228056,2017-11-04,130686574,Sara,If you are looking for a quiet retreat where the only sound is the birds tweeting and the sheep bleeting then look no further. A beautiful space with a wonderful panoramic valley view. Well appointed and equipped accommodation in easy reach of local amenities and the wonders of The Barossa. We will definitely be back!
5289072,211705443,2017-11-13,66505591,Larry,"Even If the star rating options were higher than those shown - we would score Philip and Mary’s place the max possible.
The attention to detail and the amenities offered are truly above and beyond.
Everything is so close to Mt Mckenzie that any Drive to wineries even the ‘far’ ones like Seppeltsfield or Wolf Blass are only ~15-20mins away. 
There is nothing a traveler could want for by staying at this wonderful log cabin which is so cosy and yet so spacious with more than enough accommodation for a family of 5 or 3 couples. 
Cannot reccomend Rasberry Farm high enough

Thanks again to Philip and Mary - excellent hosts"

The kids loved the Yabbies from the dam, the adults loved the peace and beauty.

Make sure you get advice from Chris on food and wine!!  It was like having our own personal concierge."
5319590,32020852,2015-05-12,26195321,Jai,We had a lovely time in this beautiful quite warm inviting home. It was just like having our own place with all the amenities left for us. Nothing to organise except just getting there. Can't wait to escape up for the weekend again 
5319590,32567848,2015-05-19,72978,Mandy,"Christine's communication and advice was
Second to none! The house was exactly as photographed if not better and she was generous in what she provided for us in terms of food and drinks. The wine tasting she arranged was fabulous and all her dining suggestions excellent. Although I'm a local Adelaidian, Christine's  home is in a part of the valley I hadn't explored and now love. We will certainly book again and look forward to it. Christine certainly gives Airb'n'b hosts a great name!! "
5319590,33797377,2015-06-01,30870837,Elizabeth,"Our welcome by Christine was warm and inviting. A lovely home to stay in with much character and history but with all the modern elements you require.

Highly recommend to stay here."
5319590,34429130,2015-06-08,18420472,Josie,"Our time - a long weekend break with friends - at Christine's farmhouse was absolutely wonderful and we would love to return. Christine was warm and welcoming, we would have loved for her to have stayed and joined us for a glass of wine around the wood-burner. Her country home was an utter retreat for us - lots of tea and hearty breakfast to set-us up for our winter wine tasting; then home at night for warm chats in the lounge. "
5319590,40908182,2015-08-03,3809345,Georgia,"The listing doesn't convey the warmth, character and charm of this place. A wonderful stay, highly recommended."
5319590,41948103,2015-08-10,72978,Mandy,"Once again a wonderful home away from home. Christine is so generous with the goodies she leaves and the quiet, natural  surrounds are such a breath of fresh air. Just hope it doesn't become so popular I can't book it again!! "

The house and land was absolutely beautiful with great views in all directions! "
5319590,44136130,2015-08-24,36782644,Zamina,"Christine's place was the perfect getaway for our family with two kids aged 2 and 4.5. We came to the Barossa to do some rock climbing in the neighbouring Kaiserstuhl Conservation Park. Christine's place was excellently located for this and the drives into the main towns were also really easy.

She greeted us on arrival and had the fire going. Her property is beautifully maintained with picturesque views across the valley. The kids loved playing up and down the hill!

Inside all amenities and provisions were impeccable and it made us feel like we were staying at home. The warmth and charm is a testament to the comforts Christine has provided and organised.

Another reason we chose to stay at Christine's was her combustion fire, as we sorely missed having one at our home this winter. (Thank you for all the firewood Christine!)

We would happily stay here again. Relaxing, homely and rejuvenating - exactly the kind of holiday we look for.

Thanks again for sharing your place with us."
5319590,45984960,2015-09-07,12491847,Vanessa,"The house and property is amazing, we enjoyed everything about it. Christine was such a perfect host and her hospitality was unbelievable!

5319590,49600907,2015-10-05,30560543,Natalie,Christine and her cute dogs gave us a very warm welcome when we arrived.  The house is lovely with some outdoor areas to sit and enjoy the sunset filtering through the trees.  Indoors you have three nice (large) double bedrooms.  Set in the countryside we all enjoyed the views of rolling green hills/vines and the occasional sound of nearby sheep.  Make sure you get the number for the local taxi service and book ahead as they can be quite busy.  Christine was also able to recommend a local tour service that we really enjoyed.
5319590,51432167,2015-10-20,13876435,Yvette,"We had a lovely 3 night stay at Christine's place, she met us on our first day and showed us around and even sat down for a drink with us and gave some suggestions about wineries and restaurants worth visiting. The home is very relaxing with lovely views (tables, chairs, lounges on 3 sides of the house so you can have a different view every day :) and the breakfast supplies provided were enjoyed overlooking the vines. Bacon, eggs, mushrooms and sourdough bread with juice and some lovely teas.
Very comfortable beds and a positive vibe made this place a winner. 
Visitors should definitely check out Harvest Kitchen @ Artisans restaurant and 1918 restaurant. 
Thanks Christine!
p.s. thanks for the cleanskin wine!"
5319590,52212677,2015-10-27,3013845,Jordana,"It was such a beautiful home and setting for our weekend away in the Barossa. Chris provided delicious breakfast food, fruit and other essentials which made our stay just that bit easier and more enjoyable. She gave us some great tips for places to eat, shops to explore and wineries to visit which we were grateful for as there is so much to choose from in the Barossa. The home itself was very comfortable and just what we needed for our relaxing time away from the city. The view over the vines and hills from the table outside was perfect for wine and cheese in the afternoon. The house was also very well placed to easily get around the main towns, sites and wineries. I would highly recommend this as a perfect place to stay to explore and enjoy the Barossa. "

Christine was extremely helpful and provided a number of suggestions on things to do around the Barossa during our stay. The house itself was very comfortable, and she provided lots of provisions which allowed us to have some very tasty breakfasts while we were there.

One of Christine's suggestions was to check out Kaiserstuhl Conservation park which is only 5 minutes away.

I didn't get chance to meet Chris directly, but she was super nice to the other guests who checked in and was great to communicate with via text. She gave us everything we needed, and went above and beyond to help us out.

We were three couples staying in the house to attend a wedding in Lyndoch. There was plenty of room for all six of us to be comfortable and hang out together in the lounge or out on the balcony enjoying the valley views. The kitchen was big enough for us to cook a couple of nice meals for everyone at the property.

The location is convenient but secluded, and we were able to get to local towns in the Barossa within 30 mins.

Would live to stay again sometime. Thanks Chris!"
5319590,57113850,2015-12-22,5381343,Karen,"We had the most wonderful weekend.

We spend a good 3 days it has been fantastic. The house itself was very comfortable, and Christine left us a lot of tasty food and fruit, which allowed us to have some very tasty breakfasts, cooking some bacon on the barbie outdoor while enjoying the beautiful view.

The Barossa is great for amazing wine tasting and great food. Thank you again Christine!"

Christine was there to meet us on the day to show us around and was very responsive when we needed help. Fridge was fully stocked with breakfast supplies and I had a wonderful time cooking for my family in her kitchen. The fireplace was much needed for winter as it can get very cold in this part of the country. Thanks for being such a great host! Too bad we couldn't stay longer. "

The kitchen was well-equipped and Christine generously left plenty of supplies from bread to bacon and eggs! Christine also shared with us passionately about the Barossa - we had fantastic pizza dinner in Angaston thanks to her recommendation!

The location was also perfect - it is just a short 7-10 minutes drive to the nearby wineries, and was a little spot of heaven.

Chris is a gorgeous and thoughtful host. The kitchen was stocked with ample breakfast supplies just for us including delicious bread. We loved its off-the-beaten track feel, but still not too far away from the centre of the Barossa. If you're going mid-winter know there is a wood fire stove to keep you warm in the living room and heaters in the bedrooms and bathroom, plus electric blankets, but it's an old house so still chilly getting from room to room. Also the lovely bedroom at the front of the house faces east and the curtains are not block out so be prepared to wake with the sunrise or bring an eye mask if light bothers you. Great comfy beds and pillows though! Netflix and other extras like little chocolates on the bedside tables are thoughtful touches. We had a great weekend and would definitely recommend."

Christine’s place is on a scenic vineyard with stunning views across the valley. 
A short taxi ride into the main towns of Angaston, Nuriootpa or Tanunda if you want to explore wineries then this is a must for your home base. 
It’s warm and cozy, the wood fire was lit when we arrived, fridge and cupboards stocked with essentials, and a lovely bottle of red waiting for us made from the very grapes we looked out upon, by Christine’s sons own hand. 
Everything you could possibly want and more. 
Christine’s a magnificent host and Tarrah Mohr is straight out of an episode of Outlander."
5319590,266371897,2018-05-20,177719563,Kym,A beautiful house in a very beautiful setting. Close to loads of great wineries and wonderful places to eat. Chris provides everything you could want for a comfortable cozy stay and was there to greet us and show us around even though we arrived later than expected. We only wish we could have stayed longer.

We had a fantastic weekend away due to staying at one of the best places the Barossa has to offer. We woke up to a spectacular sunrise over the hills and finished the nights with local cheese and wine in front of the toasty fire. Everything we could ever need was provided and Chris was a wonderful host, meeting us at the house and showing us around and answering any questions. 

I would definitely recommend Tarroh Mhoh to anyone and everyone in future."
5319590,323106272,2018-09-14,15545531,Karen,"Such a lovely old home in a fantastic, private picturesque spot.  We loved it and would highly recommend a stay at Christines.

Location is very central to the Barossa valley vineyards, the outdoor areas are really wonderful. The peace, views and welcome was all we could ask for. Tarrah Mhor felt like comming home.

5319590,345377899,2018-11-04,5052601,Verity,"We had a delightful stay at Christine's place which is a proper home from home thanks to the thoughtful touches. The cottage is located in a stunning spot on a vineyard with views over the Flaxman Valley. When we arrived we found freshly cut roses from the lovely garden in the rooms and a fridge stacked full of essentials and some lovely treats including local bacon and eggs from the hens that live in the garden.

The cottage itself was exceptionally clean and is decorated like a real home with some beautiful furniture. The kitchen was great to cook in and there were multiple places outdoors to eat. The beds were luxurious and comfortable, as was the living space and it was great to have Netflix set up on the TV.

A fantastic stay and we would love to stay again."
5319590,346477662,2018-11-08,45175221,Bernie,Christine is a friendly host. She loaded the fridge with goodies and gave us great local information to help the experience. Her home is sufficiently away from town to be a farm experience but close enough to shops and eateries to be accessible. We would return.
5319590,348443145,2018-11-13,8095532,Joy,"Christine is an incredibly helpful and welcoming host, and Tarrah Mhor is a truly unique and stunning property. Perfect for a quiet and peaceful getaway - the only sounds you hear are the birds and the breeze! - yet a convenient 10-15 minute drive from town where you can get everything you need. The house and surrounding area is charming with beautiful views, we had the most relaxing and indulgent long weekend - book now!"
5319590,349623951,2018-11-18,82594555,Simone,"The location and outlook of the home is magical with a sun-filled porch to sip your tea and watch the sun rise over the valley and vines. Christine was very helpful in connect ing us to local tour guides ahead of our visit and suggested things to do, like the wonderful Barossa Farmers Market in Angaston. You’re just a short drive from Tanunda and lots of local wineries, shops and the Barossa Sculpture Park. In fact, nothing is very far away at all. It was cool at night but we had plenty of extra blankets if we needed them. The kitchen is fully equipped for making meals. The property was spacious for our group of 5 and there is an outdoor area with festoon lights for warmer evenings. I’d highly recommend this gem!"
5319590,352877688,2018-11-26,107606313,Lisa,"Tarrrah Mor is everything you could expect is this beautiful area. Chris made us feel welcome from start to finish and was always happy to answer any questions we had. 
Her beautiful home sits atop a stunning area with views from every angle. 
The rooms are all large and beautifully furnished and the beds are all extremely comfortable with quality linens and bedding.   It was the small touches like fresh bread waiting on our arrival and fresh flowers for us to enjoy that added to our experience. 
Thank you for allowing us to live like a local in your beautiful home and we can’t wait to return."
5319590,354499973,2018-12-02,56792065,Stephanie,"Tartan Mhor is a stunning country cottage set on top of a hill providing magnificent views of vineyards and farming land! From the front porch, the sunrise was magnificent to see! The house is very clean and comfortable and has everything you need. Decorated with style, it gives a very relaxed country retreat vibe and felt very cosy and welcoming! The food provided for breakfast was fabulous as it is a little distance to get to the nearest shop! We loved our stay at Christine’s place and would highly recommend it!"

In the most beautiful quiet location minutes from Tanunda and Angaston it has everything you need for a peaceful few days. The house is airy and spacious and stylishly furnished. The beds are so comfortable and huge a good night sleep is guaranteed. We befriended Christines brown chook who joined in discussions. Incredibly good value.

5319590,424544141,2019-03-17,78914114,Liza,"We spent a weekend at this beautiful house. On our arrival Chris was already at the place, had quick run through the house with us. The house is very thoughtfully renovated and decorated old cottage with blends of old and new in every room. Modern kitchen with more supplies than we needed for our stay - bread, butter, milk, juice, tea, coffee and more! Very spacious bedrooms! Beds are comfortable with good quality linen. We spent hours on charming veranda and outdoor area simply sitting, chatting and enjoying the atmosphere away from all hussles. Our time together, these lazy conversations while overlooking the vines will stay in our memory for life! We also visited few places around the area. The house is just a short drive from vineyards, shops and eating places. Overall, we totally enjoyed our stay! A perfect weekend spent with family!"
5319590,429104002,2019-03-27,229028633,Linda,Something a bit different - old world charm on a secluded home surrounded by vineyards. Host will make your stay as enjoyable as possible.
5319590,432120697,2019-04-02,128944012,Maureen,"Tarrah Mhor is the perfect place for those who want a quiet country outlook, plenty of space in a quintessential Australian cottage, close to some nice walking trails and a short drive to all the Barossa has to offer. Christine was very thoughtful in providing things like some firewood for some unexpected chilly nights as well as a wealth of info about what to see and do. Waking to beautiful sunrises and chilling on the verandah watching the sun set with a glass of wine - what more could you want."
5319590,434958069,2019-04-09,141224971,Kelli,This is an awesome place to stay.  The pictures are very accurate and the home is fitted out with everything you need.  Great location.  Highly recommend.
5319590,435937165,2019-04-12,85556348,Kay,"We had a wonderful 3 nights at Christine’s place.  Chris has started the fire for us as it was a cool evening and it was a perfect way to settle into the house!  The house itself would work well  for friends, couples or families.  It’s an easy drive to all areas of the Barossa and Eden Valley.   Chris gave us suggestions of wineries, tours and more.  Definitely a great place to stay for a few days."

Andrew is a friendly, helpful host with a great knowledge of the local area. Andrew and Belinda were happy to provide anything extra I needed. As I was their first guest, they were still putting the final touches to the accommodation. Andrew's place was good value for money, especially for a budget conscious traveller."
5426792,55833823,2015-12-06,38514360,Alex,Friendly & generous host.  All needs were met with ease. Perfect for the Traveller or for business. Will be back. 
5426792,56501400,2015-12-14,48210388,Prue,"We couldn't have had a more friendly or helpful host, he made us very welcome. We only stayed for one night when we went to 'a day on the green' and what do you need the most? A comfy bed for a good nights sleep - and that's what we had. In the morning we discovered that the fridge had fresh fruit and milk (the things we needed for breakfast) and a host of other options. Recommend if you need good clean friendly accomodation."
5426792,58942435,2016-01-05,20462909,Nicole,"Andrew and family were lovely! Friendly, helpful and made us feel very welcome. Located in the heart of the Barossa, the separate backyard unit had everything we needed during our stay. Would definitely stay here again! "
5426792,71407982,2016-04-25,16161274,Ai-Ping,"Andrew and Belinda were both very welcoming and friendly. Their room had everything my partner and I needed and we felt very comfortable there during our stay. On top of that, we had a lot of privacy because it was a separate building from the house. 

We were visiting the Barossa for the weekend and we found that all the places we wanted to visit were only 15 minute drives away, which made getting around very convenient. If we visit the barossa again, we will definitely stay here again. Highly recommended!

"
5426792,72037336,2016-04-30,11313730,Penny,"Andrew was very friendly and helpful, even showing me the way to a meeting the day before so I wouldn't get lost on the day. Close to town too.
The shed was just as you see it on the web and the only thing that I would have liked would have been a little outdoor sitting space. Otherwise I would recommend this accommodation.
Thanks Andrew"
5426792,74349137,2016-05-15,53524879,Josh,"The accommodation was great. Immaculate, great facilities, and friendly hosts. Would happily stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. Central location in the Barossa too! "

5426792,101836544,2016-09-15,14604779,Barbara,"Stayed one very cold night. No electric blankets but Andrew did have the room heated prior to our arrival. No crockery or proper cutlery and an antique pantry/meat safe was not appropriate in the sleeping area. Overall, we left awfully early as we were not going to drink tea/coffee from plastic cups."
5426792,102341951,2016-09-17,24986439,Alice,"These are hosts that really care. The accommodation is simple but very comfortable and caters for any needs you might have. The room, kitchenette and bathroom were all very clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was the little things that really made the stay great though. The towels and face washers were folded and arranged neatly on the bed, the end of the toilet paper was folded into a triangle and a list of useful numbers (such as where to get the best pizza) was provided. Further from this, the greeting was warm, friendly and sincere and the hosts made themselves very easy to contact if there was any need. I felt like a cherished guest, being welcomed into their home and will definitely be back."
5426792,113040678,2016-11-09,100726963,Paul,"Andrew & Belinda made us feel really welcome.  Everything was set up ready for our arrival, and they had been in contact with us promptly on booking.

5426792,113458999,2016-11-12,7000014,Thibaut,"Well located in the centre of the Barossa Valley, we were welcomed by Andrew and started our exploration nicely. The shed was good and clean. Unfortunately, we had a lot of wind and rain and you can hear it during the night. A little minus point was a bit of insects around but didn't bother us too much. "
5426792,114985005,2016-11-21,76521547,Emily,"We stayed with Andrew and Belinda for one night. The converted garage room was self contained, comfortable and private. As our stay was short so we didn't meet Belinda but Andrew was friendly and accommodating. A great place to stay if you would like to spend a few days exploring SA's beautiful Barossa Valley."
5426792,117110331,2016-12-04,74548150,Andrew,"Well place in the centre of Nuriootpa, was a good place to base myself for the wedding that I was attending.  "

Andrew and Belinda are warm friendly people and true to their nature they provided a comprehensive do-it-yourself breakfast. Great value and we will return!"

The place is nicely set-up, very clean and all is provided for (good private space, nice breakfast, clean towels and linen). Andrew and Belinda are great hosts, always up for a chat and providing great tips and places to visit in the region. From their place it's a short walk to the Vine Inn, great restaurant for dinner at a reasonable price. It is also a strategic location to visit the wineries in the Barossa Valley.

We will definitely recommend their place to fellow travelers and we will book it again for our next trip to the Barossa!"

5426792,344527151,2018-11-03,165741726,Sarah,Andrew and Belinda's property is a simple but cozy little place with everything you need for a comfortable night's rest.
5426792,349253004,2018-11-16,149466190,Belinda And Martin,Quiet & comfortable with all you need. Great value.

"
5426792,355098760,2018-12-02,187223752,Mark,Very handy and comfortable
5426792,355596928,2018-12-04,44635665,Dany & Jose,Andrew & Belinda’s place has everything we needed to stay for a night. Thank you for having us.
5426792,357314312,2018-12-10,5808248,Andrew,"The description is pretty clear - it's a shed at the back of a house on a quiet road in Nuriootpa. The centre of Nuriootpa is easily walkable from the house, but from anywhere in Nuriootpa you'll need a car or a taxi to get to Tanunda or our dinner destination Hently Farm.

The shed has everything you need for a couple - really good aircon; a nice light and airy bathroom; a fridge for storing wine, milk and water; and good stable wifi. There is a cupboard full of crockery, cutlery and glassware. It's not designed to cook in but you could happily have a deli platter, light breakfast or takeaway meal there."
5426792,361133294,2018-12-22,21420548,Emma,"Very lovely. We enjoyed our stay, would definitely recommend."
5426792,362215773,2018-12-25,225168340,Michael,"Great beddings, soft pillows, great cable & internet connections.  Compact but cozy, just enough for our needs.  Great location, safe & convenient.  Superb hospitality & seamless communication by Andrew & Belinda.   Would definitely come back!"
5426792,364016189,2018-12-30,72959603,Peter,"It just looks like a shed from the outside, but very comfortably fitted out inside. Very nice stay & hosts were really friendly & helpful."
5426792,412964894,2019-02-16,122929220,Andrew,You will find an extraordinary host in Andrew (we didn't meet Belinda).  Andrew went out of his way to make sure that our overnight stay was everything and more.  The accommodation is small but had everything we needed and is set in a very quiet location in Nuriootpa.
5537173,326714346,2018-09-23,214496825,Lauren,Thank you so much for your outstanding hospitality!
5537173,336074710,2018-10-14,52715938,Belle,This place is a slice of magic. Set on the edge of a private vineyard it was easy to get to from Adelaide airport. Great weekend getaway. The villa was brand new and lots of added touches Nelly thought of. Would highly recommend.
5537173,339739383,2018-10-22,19359971,Ko,"Great location and value for money.
Nelly was excellent with providing recommendations on were to go."
5537173,345746028,2018-11-05,221661373,Lisa,My husband and I have just enjoyed a wonderful long weekend away together in one of Nelly’s cottages. The accomodation was perfect. Very clean and well presented. A lovely outdoor setting where you can catch a spectacular sunrise. The bed was very comfortable and shower amazing. The hospitality was outstanding. Incredibly thoughtful and caring and went beyond expectations to meet our needs and ensure our stay was perfect. If you’re looking for a serene and relaxing getaway you won’t be disappointed. Couldn’t fault. Highly recommend 
5646514,34198097,2015-06-06,8279614,Jodi,"Wyndham and his family were amazing hosts! Right from before we arrived they were already giving us some tips on where the locals go so that we could maximise our time in the Barossa. The house was beautiful - impeccably decorated by Wyndhams wife Patricia - and very comfortable (especially the beds).  We also visited Whynhams winery Moorooroo which was excellent and had a private tasting with Jodie, Whynhams sister in law, who also ensured we had some Moorooroo wine back at the house, and helped us ship some home too. All in all this was the best airbnb we have ever stayed at, from the luxurious house to the lovely family that made us feel so welcome and were so helpful. If you are visiting the Barossa, this is the best place to stay! "
5646514,35734017,2015-06-21,35744375,Nicholas,"We decided to head into the Barossa for my wife's birthday. We hit AirBnB and found the Winemaker's Retreat. The photographs got us very interested and we weren't disappointed. It's exactly as it appears in the photos which was fantastic. Our stay was in the middle of Winter their heating was fabulous and cosy. 

The bedding was luxurious and very comfortable. 
The house was spectacularly clean and organised we had everything we needed for two couples.

The pool was a nice feature, but clearly not applicable this time of year. I can imagine summer around the pool would be fabulous. 

Central to Tanunda was a bonus. Supermarket, local shopping all within 5 mins. Major wineries and attractions such as Hentley Farm where we went for dinner only a $15 cab ride away. 

Basically this was luxe accommodation all around. "
5646514,37374859,2015-07-06,6927387,Talitha,"Wyndham & Patricia made us feel welcome before we arrived; thinking to check about how we'd like the beds arranged (four friends) and our preferences. Our welcome from Jodie was great at the cellar door and a good introduction to the region and house.
The description of the house is spot on, beautifully styled, extremely comfortable beds (all of them, not just the main!) cosy and comfortable, with everything we needed (coffee pods for the morning, fresh milk in the fridge!). Although it was winter, the house gets a lot of gorgeous morning sun and light through the day, we were able to have brunch out the back & outside, which was really nice. The heating system is excellent - allowing you to regulate different zones separately - which meant everyone had a good sleep. All the appliances were great and easy to use (or had easy to follow instructions) and it was easy to find whatever we needed in the kitchen.
The house is right in town and you could easily walk to the bakery, the shops, or from their local (the Clubhouse). Lots of great options to eat nearby, and also within a 20min drive for more wineries, cheese platters - ideally located.
We loved it in winter, but would be great to come back in the warmer months and enjoy what looked like a beautiful yard and the pool too!"
5646514,38053463,2015-07-12,4339785,Anton,It was a very pleasant stay in a gorgeous house with lots attention for details. Very tasty wines as well.
5646514,41804479,2015-08-09,37004710,Sharon,"My husband and I enjoyed a lovely weekend with close friends at the Winemakers Retreat. This accommodation was within walking distance of the main shopping area and coffee shops of Tanunda. We enjoyed the cozy decor of the home which was superbly decorated with a french influence. As we had been wine tasting most of Saturday including tastings with Jodie at Wyndham's own Winery, we decided to ""eat in"" and discovered a well equipped and organised kitchen offering all utensils we could possibly need. The bedrooms were lovely and we all enjoyed a good nights sleep on comfortable and inviting beds. In the morning we enjoyed our breakfast sitting in the sun by the pool. Unfortunately we did not have the opportunity to meet Wyndham and his family but appreciated his care and concern though email contact. We would recommend this accommodation to anyone lucky enough to enjoy time in the superb Barossa."
5646514,43130137,2015-08-17,40083438,Sy,"Excellent hospitality , very comfortable accommodation, perfect position in Barossa. definitely worth the money. Will come back again. 
 "
5646514,46062967,2015-09-07,29497081,Catherine,"We had a wonderful long weekend in the beautiful house. Very welcoming, perfect location and exactly what we needed. Very clean, comfortable, warm for a winter weekend. A lovely home, great communication & lots of local recommendations, which were very much appreciated . Thankyou Wyndham "
5646514,47673722,2015-09-21,14919691,Louise,"Wow, what a great visit to the winemakers retreat.  After a bit of a struggle to get into the property (not the hosts problem) we were welcomed to a warm, wonderfully decorated property, that made our stay in the Barossa even better.
The house is bigger than it appears in the photos and each room is wonderfully decorated with ample space to stretch out make yourself comfortable.  The beds are very comfy too!
Not far from Tanunda, it is in a quiet spot with off street parking and everything you could want.  
I would highly recommend this property, we had great contact with the hosts and will stay next time I visit.  Thanks Wyndham."
5646514,49884685,2015-10-07,18078607,Paul,"What an amazing property!!  It was much nicer than we ever thought possible - and we thought it looked very nice from the pictures and description anyway.  Beautiful house in the middle of the Barossa easy driving to all the wineries, restaurants and attractions - walking distance to the little town of Tanunda where 1918 is great!  The house has three excellent bedrooms, a nice pool area and multiple indoor and outdoor eating areas of chilling and relaxing.  The owners were easy to contact and provided us with a nice bottle of Rose on arrival also!  If you're going to the Barossa stay here!"
5646514,50287062,2015-10-11,39510201,Michelle,Can strongly recommend Winemakers Retreat! Beautifully appointed home with everything you need. Very clean and well looked after and in a great location. Can't wait to return! 
5646514,51117301,2015-10-18,2793382,Daniela,"We were thoroughly impressed with the Winemakers Retreat! Four of us stayed here over a weekend while we hired bikes to visit wineries and the venue couldn't have been any more perfect. The photos really don't do it justice. It was beautifully decorated, very clean and had everything you could need for a comfortable stay. Although we didn't get to meet Wyndham contact was very easy and we were happy that an earlier key pick up was arranged so that we could be on our bikes early. In very close proximity to a great bakery but beware, it's closed on Sundays. Would definitely recommend this property and would stay here again. Thanks Wyndham!"
5646514,64376763,2016-03-03,405534,Penny,Really quiet and very comfortable. Great kitchen and pantry and really awesome to chill by the pool after a day's work. It is a home away from home! Wyndham is awesome and very responsive. Thanks for everything!
5646514,69433413,2016-04-11,56779448,Amy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, Wydham's recommendations for places of interest was beyond the call. A delightful time was had."
5646514,108770651,2016-10-17,30468770,Helen,"Wyndham was a wonderful host and made us feel most welcome. He was in regular contact to make sure we had everything we needed. We had a special wine tasting with a lunch plater provided. This was a real treat. The winery and gardens were magnificent. Our accommodation was beautiful. The furnishings were luxurious. The beds were enormous and so comfortable and the claw foot bath was a rare treat. It was a real pleasure to prepare meals in the spacious, modern kitchen. We loved the separate living area with large screen TV. The overall experience was fantastic. The garden and pool were magical. The was plenty of outdoor living space. The neighbourhood was quiet yet the house was a short distance to town and excellent shopping facilities. A large number of wineries are only a few minutes drive from this property. "
5646514,112650229,2016-11-06,7154773,Jamie,My family and I had a lovely stay at the Winemaker's Retreat. We were greeted with an invitation to the hosts' beautiful winery and were made to feel welcome. The retreat is absolutely lovely was an excellent place for us to spend time relaxing after our days exploring the surrounding wine country. We would love to stay again next time we visit. 
5646514,114342053,2016-11-17,9645504,Nick,A lovely place ideally located for exploring the Barossa including riding. Wyndham and Patricia were fantastic hosts and were very welcoming. The house itself is very tastefully decorated and a wonderful relaxing space. Highly recommended!
5646514,115772313,2016-11-26,93960973,Emily,"Wyndham's place was the perfect spot for our honeymoon. Favourite aspects of our stay included the privacy of the space, the private pool, dimmer switches on the lights, the large bathtub, the massive comfy bed and of course the outdoor shower! The house was central to all our outings, including some amazing restaurant dinners. Wyndham gave us the space and privacy we needed, while still maintaining excellent communication. We didn't want to leave. "
5646514,126049211,2017-01-08,11914907,Helen,"Beautiful 3 bedroom 2 bathroom cottage, 3 minute drive from Tanunda township. Gardens beautifully tended. Pool and Aircon greatly needed on consecutive 35 degree plus days! Place immaculate, bedlinen and towels provided. Host very helpful and attentive. Had a great stay with our 3 adult children "
5646514,131135597,2017-02-10,72172982,Jeremy,"We stayed at the ""Winemaker's Retreat"" for two weeks in February.  It exceeded all of our expectations.

The property is spacious, clean and elegantly decorated both indoors and outdoors. We were pleasantly surprised to see the awesome kitchen.  It is large, open and well equipped for those who enjoy preparing their own meals, which you can enjoy with a bottle of wine purchased from one of the many amazing nearby cellar doors.  The kitchen includes marble countertops, a gas range, an island, and all the tools you will likely need.  The pool and garden spaces provide an ideal setting for which to relax, cool down and enjoy the fruits of Barossa.  Given that there were several days in the high 30s or low 40s the pool provides excellent relief from the South Australia heat.

The property is ideally located for those wishing to visit the wineries of the Barossa with many just a short drive or bike ride away.

Wyndham and Patricia were gracious hosts who provided excellent recommendations and quickly replied to all of our queries.

I would eagerly return to the ""Winemaker's Retreat"" and strongly recommend the property to anyone considering a holiday in the area.  "
5646514,131640037,2017-02-12,16844293,Anthony,"Everything was just perfect about this house, everything we needed and was centrally located to many wineries we could even walk to a few of them! Loved the pool and kitchen had everything we needed to make a meal, thanks! "
5646514,142159625,2017-04-06,70724813,Wendy,This was a wonderful place to stay. Easy driving to wineries and walking distance great bakery for morning coffee and restaurants in the evening!
5646514,212690364,2017-11-19,134067370,Stacey,"The Winemakers Retreat is paradise in the Barossa. A private & beautiful property close enough to everything but far enough removed to be relaxing.
French Provincial charm with extremely comfortable bedrooms , lounges and eclectic styling throughout."
5646514,227080110,2018-01-13,6934310,Sean,"My friends and I were greatly impressed by the beautiful furnishings and decorations throughout the house.

5646514,235203764,2018-02-15,11674963,Jon,"Wonderfully private and expansive property with multiple house, pool house. pool and garden areas to enjoy.  Great value for a family or 2 couples looking for something special."
5646514,271288176,2018-06-01,30468770,Helen,"This accommodation offers plenty of space, comfortable beds and a delightful garden. Unfortunately it was too cold to sit outside most of the time. There is an eclectic mix of furnishings and decorations which certainly adds to the charm of this lovely home. It is a short walk into town and the Tanunda Bakery is a t the end of the street.  This location is perfect for visiting the wonderful wineries of the region.  Equally it is a great place to simply unwind. "
5646514,280706368,2018-06-24,187585707,Marita,"A great home - we walked into warmth and comfort on a very cold Barossa day. The house is within walking distance to a great little restaurant , 1918, and is close to a number of exceptional wineries. Wyndham ensured the stay was extra special with breakfast provisions provided and a selection of wines from Moorooroo Winery. I expect the house would be just as delightful in the warmer weather, with beautiful outdoor dining areas and a pool."
5646514,288484379,2018-07-10,183483877,Lisa,"It was a lovely stay 
Thankyou"
5646514,351210200,2018-11-22,64936905,Shaun,"Patricia and Wyndham were gracious, hospitable and responsive hosts! Their place is gorgeous with many personal touches amenities that made for a relaxing and memorable stay in the Barossa. We couldn’t have asked for a better location, central to the wineries and restaurants we visited. We’re looking forward to returning next year for a much longer stay!"
5646514,356638053,2018-12-08,46348074,Esther,My friends and I had a great stay! The pool during the hot Adelaide summer was amazing!! The house was very clean and spacious. It's close enough to be within walking distance to shops and even a couple wineries. Wyndham and his crew were wonderful. Would stay here again and would definitely recommend to friends!
5646514,402256010,2019-01-17,27760689,Sam,"It was very hot and the ducted air conditioning was a great reprieve. The pool was enjoyed by the kids. It was great to have some wine there we could buy and drink by the pool when we arrived. 
Thank you"

5646514,419430598,2019-03-03,38932680,Diane,"I can’t recommend this property highly enough.
I care about interiors and this certainly hit the button.
A great, spacious, stylish and comfortable house.
Comfortable beds, good linens etc etc."
5646514,435921768,2019-04-12,36734173,Isabel,"Great place... Good people and easy to walk into town for a morning stroll or just saty in and cook a meal to enjoy the great kitchen. 
Thank you!"
6149133,71526538,2016-04-26,58400395,Emma,The host canceled this reservation 158 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6149133,79732925,2016-06-13,11461028,Brooke,I stayed at the Reserve Barossa Valley one a group trip with a few couples and had the best time!  Simone was extremely helpful in giving us all the information we were after before our arrival. The property is beautiful and looks just like the pictures (maybe better). Everything was nice and clean. We loved the wood fire pizza oven and the spa! Would highly recommend
6157653,34479591,2015-06-08,19977907,Kimberley,"A massive thank you to Julie for such a wonderful stay in the Barossa. If you're looking for a beautiful B&B in a perfect location this is it. The property was perfect, beautifully decorated, super clean and new and lots of privacy. My friend and I were sad to leave. Also great breakfast from the local cafe which Julie provides $20 daily vouchers for. Highly recommend Barossa Barn! "
6157653,42869084,2015-08-16,15463417,Andy,"Lovely location. Friendly and discrete owners.
Nice and warm inside during cold Barossa winter!"
6157653,49635430,2015-10-05,24532455,Michelle,"We had a lovely stay in the Barossa at Julie's converted barn.  Well equipped and spacious, beautifully decorated (love a chandelier in a bathroom!) and gorgeous gardens.  

While there are limited cooking facilities, this is amply compensated by vouchers for breakfast each day at a local cafe in Angaston.  (Breakfast is served until 3pm and the servings are huge!)

Julie does note in her listing that the bathroom in on the lower level, with master bed/living space upstairs.  This wasn't problematic for us, however the stairs are quite steep so property wouldn't suit someone with mobility issues.  

Thanks for a delightful stay."
6157653,53265739,2015-11-07,4368878,Peter,"We were greeted by Julie and welcomed to the Barossa Barn. The first impression was WOW. The photos don't do justice to the warm and sophisticated feeling of this listing. We had a fantastic stay. Julie & Neil have thought of everything, lots of information, great facilities, a most comfortable bed, even Foxtel with all the HD movie channels etc. The breakfast vouchers were also excellent, entitling us to a delicious cooked breakfast at a nearby cafe. The location was also excellent. A perfect centre point to our daily excursions around the Barossa wineries. Special mention: try to have dinner at Ferment Asian. A delightful experience with 5 star service."
6157653,54092062,2015-11-16,39560375,Amy,Everything about our stay at Barossa Barn was perfect! The location was great and the accommodations very charming as well as the local breakfast cafe and our wonderful hosts. We would highly recommend a stay here if you are planning a visit to the Barossa. Julie and Neil even helped us with planning our itinerary and dining options. This mini-vacation could not have been better for us!
6157653,54622453,2015-11-22,47796153,Coralee,"Julie our host welcomed us on arrival, showed us to her unique beautiful B@B it was as described on line so charming, convenient comfortable to all the Barossa.

6157653,55259063,2015-11-29,12146271,Andrea,Lovely accomodation in a peaceful and very handy area of the Barossa. Every comfort you could wish for and exceptionally clean and welcoming. We spent two nights at the barn and could have spent longer if we had more time. Breakfast included at the local cafe was great as was the free wifi. Highly recommend!
6157653,67492802,2016-03-29,56120503,Angela,"My partner and I enjoyed a quiet weekend at the Barossa Barn. The accommodation is a bit of comfort in a rustic setting. Julie and Neil were busy gardening on their lovely property when we arrived. The house (converted barn) is set up with 2 bedrooms, a bathroom, and toilet downstairs, and large open room upstairs with a queen bed, living area and efficiency-type kitchen. There is a small balcony off the top of the stairs that overlooks the garden.

The bed was very comfy, with high quality sheets. We were able to make coffee in the morning with the kettle and french press provided. The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, cutlery, and glasses, and supplies for tea and coffee. We enjoyed a picnic dinner one evening with the spoils of our trip to the Barossa Farmer’s Market and the Barossa Cheese Company, both of which are just down the road. There’s plenty of cutting boards and knives for the cheeses, breads and mettwurst! Lovely to be able to enjoy a real taste of the region, and I really do strongly recommend a visit to Farmer's Market during your stay. We did not take advantage of the breakfasts supplied at the local cafe, as we were either getting an early start out to the wineries or sleeping in.

The nights were perfectly quiet and we slept soundly. The location is semi-suburban. They are the outer edge of a residential neighbourhood as it transitions into farmland. Angaston was a lovely little township about 2km away, and there is plenty to eat and drink nearby. It’s a nice area for strolling. We took a taxi one evening for a special dinner so that we could enjoy the wine. 

All in all a very pleasant, relaxing stay— wish we could have stayed longer, and would definitely stay again. Wonderful location for a good food and wine weekend!"
6157653,75727197,2016-05-22,43325498,Damien,"The place was beautiful and Julie was more than accommodating, even providing a complimentary bottle of wine because of a faulty TV! Highly recommended."
6157653,79618724,2016-06-13,25290411,Katherine,"We loved our stay, thank you! 5 stars - the place was lovely and in a great location in the Barossa. Lovely hosts too - highly recommend"
6157653,102306916,2016-09-17,32650070,Louise,Great B&B.  Very comfortable and clean.  Having foxtel and wifi included was great and loved the complimentary port and chocolates.  Julie was a very helpful host.  Highly recommend.
6157653,105735143,2016-10-02,24353741,Henry,We had a great stay at the barn B&B. Would definitely recommend staying here.

6157653,238521887,2018-02-26,48460200,Jane,Wonderful stay. Would highly recommend.
6157653,263022195,2018-05-11,152550529,Chris,A beautiful spot in a cozy cottage. Julie is an excellent host; great service and advice for sightseeing. Neat and tiny; an old building with history with modern amenities for comfort.
6157653,266292875,2018-05-19,26397239,Sarah,"My husband and I booked The Barn for our first visit to the Barossa. We wanted a unique space to stay for 2 nights that was central to the wine tasting action - and this location is perfect! Check in was seamless - Julie texted me the key code so we could let ourselves in to the property. It was chilly when we arrived, however,  the air-con acts as a heater and kept us warm all weekend. 

We were very impressed by the space and the thoughtful touches from Julie - wine tasting map and information, details on local activities and things to do (such as the Saturday morning Farmer's Market - unmissable!), a tasty Port for after dinner and other special touches. 

The kitchen only has a microwave, so we ate out one evening and bought curries from the Farmer's Market to heat up the next evening. The bathroom is beautiful with an amazing claw foot tub I enjoyed an aromatherapy bath in. The stairs up to the main area are narrow and sloping, so it's not recommended for people with mobility issues as the bathroom and toilet are downstairs. Julie supplies Foxtel as the local channels are limited. We found the bed too hard for our liking, however, we prefer a very soft bed, so this is purely personal preference. 

Overall, highly recommended for location, space and comfort. Thanks, Julie!"

It was also a very private space, and we felt very much at home here.  The bed was very comfortable and whilst it was a bit dark inside the house, this worked well for the hot days, as did the airconditioner.  If you want to visit the Barossa for a period of time, this is a perfect place to stay as it's a great location, right on the edge of town with a fabulous restauraunt at one end of the street, and numerous wineries at the other, all within walking distance.  Also right next to the bike path.  Thanks for making our stay memorable Wendy!"

The cottage is clean and well equipped, and the bed is really comfortable - my husband said he had his first really good ""sleep-in"" for some time!
Wendy is a thoughtful host and clear and responsive communicator.
We would certainly go again."
6170279,235230278,2018-02-16,50157837,Romina,"I recently stayed at Wendy's cottage for a night, it was a beautiful space and Wendy was very hospitable. We informed her we would be arriving early due to doing a wine tour that started at 10am and asked if we could leave our rental car there, which she said was no problem. When we arrived, the previous guests had already left so Wendy was kind enough to let us leave our bags in the cottage garden and wait there until our tour car arrived. The space itself is gorgeous, had all the amenities we needed, a comfy bed and lovely garden area. It's very close to a few good wine/restaurant spots too. Thanks Wendy!"

We had a perfect time staying in Wendy's little cottage, the bed is super comfy, the garden is funky and lovely, Wendy was a really welcoming host.  Easy to stroll to Peter Lehmann, Langmeil, David Franz cellar doors.  About a 25 minute walk into Tanunda so easily doable for dinner too once you have sampled too much to drive anywhere.
For a weekend getaway for two in the Barossa you can't really ask for more."

Would recommend this place to others."
6170887,40950252,2015-08-03,15160525,Chloe,"The first time I have booked using airbnb and I am a convert thanks to the Elderton Wines Guest house. As a group of four girls from Melbourne and Perth we stayed here last weekend (the beginning of August). The house is in such a central location, it's specious and was a great space to stay in winter and we all could picture it being just as wonderful at any time of the year. We instantly felt at home.  The house could also comfortably sleep six people with three bedrooms and has all the facilities you might need. 

We were made to feel really welcome with a bottle of wine on our arrival and our host recommending restaurants and wineries to us before we arrived. When we come back to the Barossa we will most definitely stay here! "
6170887,45948275,2015-09-07,37290444,Alison,"The stay at Elderton Lodge was great, we received a warm welcome from Tush, the lodge was comfortable and convenient to all amenities.

We enjoyed tasting the wines at the tasting room and sharing a bottle kindly provided by the lodge.

Would recommend this to others wishing to explore the Barossa."
6170887,52217422,2015-10-27,41674703,Brendan,Elderton Wines lodge was a clean and comfortable house. It is well located within walking distance of most locations in Nuriootpa. The support at the cellar door was excellent and we enjoyed tasting the range of wines. Would recommend as a base to explore the Barossa region.
6170887,57889981,2015-12-30,47735914,Nemish,We loved our staying in Elderton Guest house. House is perfectly located near to all the shops and restaurants.  Best part was the park near by which kids enjoyed every day. I would say it is perfect place for small family of two adult and 2 kids to group of 4 to 5 adults.
6170887,60981555,2016-01-30,37530274,Jack,"What an amazing Place. Elderton guest house is the perfect base for exploring the Barossa. The house was close to the centre of Nuriootpa and right next door to the Elderton vineyard.

On arrival, a bottle of red and a bottle of white were awating for us in the house. The place was very clean and tidy with everything and more than you need. 

Tush thank you so much for being such an amazing host, and indulging us with a wine tasting. I recommend this to anyone who stays there. Tush is also a wealth of knowledge on what to explore in the area and also made us feel extremely welcome.

We will definitely be back.  
"
6170887,61156394,2016-02-01,18888028,Chris,"Lovely clean comfortable home, fully equipped with nice welcoming touches.

6170887,71199410,2016-04-24,33000424,Ken,"We were four guys enjoying a golf and wines experience. Communication leading up to our stay was terrific. Once there, everything was at or above expectation. We collected the keys from Elderton Cellar Door and enjoyed an excellent tasting session hosted by Tush (rhymes with ""rush"", of which there was none - but ""just don't call me Trish""). We learned from her and enjoyed her suggested wines.
All voted for a return next year.
"
6170887,79731516,2016-06-13,27806867,Megan,"Comfortable and cozy stay. Great location. Stayed here with 6 guests  (2 couples 2 friends ) and it was a good size, not too small.

6170887,104829974,2016-09-28,2724177,Brittany,"Very close to all amenities and some amazing wineries. Check in was smooth and the guest house is actually on a seperate street (roughly 50m away) from the Cellar door, so you can enjoy some privacy.
There was 6 of us, and we had a fantastic stay at Elderton. Some nights spent enjoying the Barossa, and some cooking at home. Very enjoyable!
Thank you!"

6170887,137509794,2017-03-15,8442990,Stephen,"I stayed at Elderton house with my parents and partner for two nights as we visited the Barossa wine region. The house was in a great central but also nice and quiet location for visiting the nearby wineries and restaurants. The house is very nice with two full bedrooms, a kitchen and living room and very modern bathroom. The providing of continental breakfast supplies were great for feeding us in the mornings. 

The only hiccup during our stay was that the hot water heater was broken when we arrived. The hosts sent their maintenance people out the next morning to fix it which was excellent, unfortunately this meant we only had hot water for the last morning of our two night stay."
6170887,139140079,2017-03-23,27634546,Kimberley,"A group of 6 friends stayed here on our way to Clare for a wedding. The staff at Elderton were very welcoming.

The cottage was in amongst the wine district with vines in front of the cottage, but walking distance from Tanunda.  Tununda has a lovely village feel with boutique shops and cafes central to all the main attractions.  Cynthia was very welcoming the cottage was supper stocked with a breakfast feast and everything needed.  The retro deco was very impressive with lots of treasures, also so fab cook books to browse.

Breakfast food was delicious and generous (cooking provisions as well as more mundane) along with a lovely bottle of wine.

Thorough information pack gave us heaps of info on the area and the best spots to eat whilst in the region. 

Very well organised; host was away but made regular contact prior to our arrival to ensure arrangements for key and housing were all in order.

Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a spot to stay."

The hosts did a wonderful job stocking it just right and thinking through what we would need. On our last day, we cooked eggs laid by the chickens my daughter visited earlier.

And there's nothing like having a vintner as your landlord while you're in the area tasting wine :)

Highly recommend!"

6296823,110833926,2016-10-28,99153392,Matthew,"Don't be fooled by the 1980's build as this place has immense charm, abundant good taste and a great layout. Secluded and private but also in a perfect position for exploring the valley. Surrounded by grapevines, native cypress and its own kitchen garden. Cynthia encouraged foraging so we grazed on fresh herbs, spinach, spring onions and asparagus. An ideal experience; a microcosm of the broader growers valley itself. Rolf and Cynthia are generous hosts and the breakfast provisions, wine and facilities were terrific. We only had a few days, but a meal at FermentAsian was sublime and by the time we dined at Hentley Farm, reality was slipping as the euphoria was overtaking us. A perfect break and Veritas cottage was so central to it all in more ways than one. A brilliant place to stay. Thanks."

The check in & communication with our host Cynthia at all times was super-easy. There were a number of small touches that really made the cottage excellent, including ample food for breakfasts, local information, complimentary bottle of wine and an honesty bar with extra wine if you run out. The air conditioning was a must for us (we spent Christmas Day here at 40 degree heat, so that was essential). 

There is one other property nearby but the cottage feels extremely private. There is a nice little patio area with chairs & a table looking out onto the vines. "

6296823,145369466,2017-04-17,33090434,Kathryn,"What a wonderful special private place, an escape from reality! The house was lovely and was well set up for all our needs. It was easily within walking distance of town and to numerous wineries close by. Our hosts were very helpful, easy to communicate with, and on top of it have an amazing winery. Looking forward to heading back very soon to this gem!Cheers "
6296823,145947556,2017-04-20,29425385,Suzanne,"Cynthia was the perfect host. Although we didn't meet in person, veritas cottage was so homely and full of personal touches. The bottle of wine and breakfast provisions were a lovely touch and most welcome. 

The house is full of quirky vintage character but we immediately felt at home.

The location is perfect - short drive to Tanunda and a load of popular vineyards and cellar doors. 

Would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to base themselves to explore the Barossa."
6296823,149564449,2017-05-05,115170919,Gordo,"Cynthia and the Rolf Binder gang were more than accommodating. A behind the scenes look of the winery topped it up! The cottage was lovely, secluded, but close to the town center and the wineries of Barossa. "
6296823,149998119,2017-05-06,10513702,Tom,"Cynthia greeted us just after we arrived and made us feel very welcome in her cosy rental cottage. We cooked a meal in the well-equipped kitchen one night of our stay. We had dinner at a great restaurant in town on the other. The place was everything we needed for our short stay in the Barossa.

If you're wanting self catering and quiet accommodation on the outskirts of Tanunda, with a super-friendly host who goes the distance on customer service, then this is the place for you."
6296823,159382259,2017-06-11,56314903,Lucy,"Loved our stay at veritas cottage. The cottage was perfect, a retro feel, in a beautiful garden setting. Cynthia and Rolf were extremely hospitable. Just look inside their fridge for eg. Eggs bacon sausages fruit yogurt bread OJ - you name it. Very cosy clean and in a perfect spot when touring around the barossa valley- tasting all the beautiful wines. Rolf being his own winemaker - giving us a tour - tasting wines out of the barrell was a very personal touch. Thankyou. They also left us a bottle of their wine to enjoy. And their yummy port. Very fun hosts- allowing us to join their night. Definitly a must stay at the cottage- a peaceful getaway- and a must to go tasting at their cellar door. Beautiful wines. Some of the nicest in the Barossa. Cynthias communication was perfect prior- sharing tips for us. Thankyou to both of you. A perfect stay."

Cynthia provided us with a generous supply of breakfast items, fruits, milk, cereals, jams, bacon and fresh eggs from her chickens. And a bottle of superb wine from the Rolf Binder winery - they make beautiful wines.

We stayed with my parents-in-law and enjoyed spending time there playing pool and watching movies on the large screen TV when the weather turned inclement and we needed to stay indoors.

6732428,354186440,2018-12-01,2940765,Craig,"Really enjoyed staying at Susan’s place. Great size, great location and an all round great experience."
6732428,357289120,2018-12-09,145470753,Sonia,Great house
6732428,363980389,2018-12-29,86954593,Peter,Great location close to town. Plenty of space to make yourself at home and lovely big pergola to sit under at the end of the days wine tasting. Tastefully decorated with all the mod cons.
6732428,367890014,2019-01-05,6185667,Peggy,Susan’s place in Tanunda was extremely clean. The second bathroom is a little odd configuration but we made it work.  There were 3 couples traveling for a month.  So the bedrooms are a little tight for space.   Location is not as close to Tanunda as we had expected but all in all a very nice stay.  Susan responded immediately to any issues we had.  Thank you Susan.  Loved Tanunda!
6732428,402563083,2019-01-18,85815150,Jonathan,Susan hosted us brilliantly. The check-in was seamless and the house was spotless clean with a welcoming feel. We had everything we needed for a comfortable and fun stay in the Barossa. Would highly recommend
6732428,405912048,2019-01-27,45236984,Abhishek,Susan was a great host. Good place to stay. Quite location and very close to the main street in Tunanda.
6732428,410900718,2019-02-10,100451177,Geoffrey,"Exactly what it promised: great location for the visit, sparkling clean and recently-decorated, large spa bath in one of the bathrooms (which we didn't get to use), lovely kitchen (plus great outdoor-dining bbq area). The fresh eggs and welcome bottle of wine were an unexpected extra (thanks again!), and the kitchen had a lot of spices, tea/coffee choices, and various cupboard staples which helped with out own catering. The pool table was a popular feature for our group, but lots of space for everyone to spread out too. Would be delighted to come back and absolutely recommend (for couples - one couple or a group - but also great for families)."
6732428,413012901,2019-02-17,25565580,Suzanne,Susan's place is great for a group or family. Heaps of space and the outdoor dining area is huge. Good quality furniture and fittings throughout.  We loved the pool table as well. Highly recommended as a base for visiting the Barossa.
6732428,417064320,2019-02-25,118294666,Jessica,We had a gorgeous 4 days at this beautiful place. Such a comfy place and sooo many butterflies everywhere. It’s a really gorgeous place with everything you need ! Would definitely stay again no question!
6732428,421581288,2019-03-09,82744194,Donny,"Beautiful and clean home,deserved a 5 stars.Bed is comfy,kitchen very well equipped,Susan is very generous and thoughtful that she has provided all kind of spices and sauces. Wifi is of top notch and really enjoyed the pool table.The outdoor bbq area is excellent and is definitely the best equipped outdoor bbq area that I have come across in the airbnb apts,it even come with a fridge.We have definitely enjoyed our stay in Susan's home and will definitely recommend to friends."
6732428,424517631,2019-03-17,2794014,Sammy,A fantastic house close to a number of barossa wineries. Big entertainment area with large TVs with PS consoles. The outdoor BBQ area was great for enjoying the day and relaxing with a glass of wine. The whole house is clean and spacious. Simple padlock with PIN for easy self check-in. The host left us extra eggs and a bottle of wine!
6732428,430581623,2019-03-31,227681555,Jason,"Wow! This place is fantastic.
Great location and the amenities caiter for all ages! 
I recommend this place highly and will be back for sure. 

Thanks Susan this house is a true gem."
6732428,433688364,2019-04-07,35814680,Clarke,Great house with amazing outdoor area. Perfect location in the heart of the Barossa
7055506,40957667,2015-08-03,3242998,Gloria,"We had a wonderful stay, Karen made us feel so welcome and at home and gave us lots of helpful suggestions on where to go during our trip.  Absolutely fantastic location, just a short drive from all of the wineries and town centre.  We especially loved the indoor fireplace, fluffy bathrobes and that the pantry was so well stocked with farm fresh produce - we didn't have to go out to get anything. Karen was easy going and really helpful - always just a quick text or call away.  The house was spotless and made a great retreat. We would definitely come back!"
7055506,42422921,2015-08-13,5777212,Ian,"Is there a better place to stay in the Barossa Valley ?? Nestled in a beautiful little vineyard, you are just a few minutes from Tanunda and Nuriootpa and all that they have to offer. The cottage has all you could possibly need and Karen stocks the larder with sensational local produce. Would not hesitate to recommend the Vineyard Cottage to friends and family. "
7055506,45419479,2015-09-02,4425011,Amanda,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at under the vines. Karen was very welcoming and there is lots of local area info available at the property. The local produce provided for brekky was fantastic, and loved chilling out with a wine by the fire in the evenings. Location is close to lots of wineries and eateries. Would definitely recommend this awesome spot! "
7055506,46423269,2015-09-10,41965695,Daniel,Was a wonderful experience staying at Under the vines. When we arrived there was a little chocolate on the bed for each guest and there was even a treat for our 18 month old toddler. The description and location were accurate and we really enjoyed staying here. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience.
7055506,48710441,2015-09-28,9441817,Justin,Karren was lovely she was very welcoming and the place was much as described and more. She helped me out great sorted out wine and a platter for me for a special occassion it was close to wineries as we rode our bikes around for the day. I would very much recomend karen and her cottage we will certianly be back. Lovely spot. 
7055506,52740541,2015-11-01,10899597,Yvonne,"Great house on small vineyard, with an incredibly well equipped kitchen, with local milk and cream in the fridge! Great location, only a max 15 minute drive to all the main attractions of Barossa."
7055506,56120731,2015-12-09,25514930,Michelle,"Karen made us feel very welcome, by greeting us at the property and showing us where everything was. She gave us some excellent local tips - where to eat, which wineries to visit, etc.

The property was great. Very private and truly under the vines - gorgoeus, handy location. It was clean and well appointed with comfortable king sized beds, excellent breakfasts and AC (much needed on our 40+ degree mini break!). "
7055506,59507895,2016-01-11,29343482,Dan,"I really enjoyed my stay at Under the Vines. A very cool venue, complete with jacuzzi bath and surrounded by the vines. Karen made the process very smooth and we'd be happy to recommend it to friends."
7055506,60272629,2016-01-21,15948897,David,"What a fantastic spot! Thanks to Karen for meeting us on a tricky timeframe as we raced across NSW, Victoria and SA, but the trip was well worth it. Well-appointed for our group of five, with beautiful local produce for breakfast waiting for us. Sitting on the back porch looking over the vines to the Barossa Ranges was amazing and everywhere we wanted to visit was within easy reach. Bathroom and exterior toilets are fine - just watch out for the spiders."
7055506,60679314,2016-01-26,47291939,Kelly,"The perfect location for a weekend in the Barossa - quiet, set amongst vineyards, and close to Tanunda. The breakfast supplies were phenomenal and there's all the basics you need if you're going to cook a meal for dinner. Karen and Russell were great hosts, and very receptive to our individual requests. We totally recommend Under the Vines!"
7055506,62154294,2016-02-12,23573308,Paul,"Two big thumbs up!  The description and photos are entirely accurate.  This is a delightful, spacious, fully equipped and comfortable home.  That it's smack dab in the middle of a vineyard is a bonus.  It's about halfway between the villages of Tanunda and  Nurioopa, so a car is needed for shopping and restaurants. The location is otherwise perfect as a base for wine tasting in the Barossa.  "
7055506,63032285,2016-02-19,56888746,Peter,"Under The Vines was a perfect little spot for a relaxing stay. Everything was provided and the food provided was of exceptional quality and taste.

This is definitely a hidden gem among quality Barossa accommodation. 

I most certainly recommend staying here."
7055506,65012671,2016-03-10,54111226,Claire,"We stayed at Karen's vineyard cottage at the beginning of March and had the most wonderful time.  The accommodation was exactly as described and the kitchen was so well stocked with equipment it was like being in my own kitchen at home.
The locally sourced breakfast items that were provided were amazing as were all the little extras like leaving a little box of smarties for our toddler.
It was great to have all the entertainment equipment as we loved being able to plug our iPod in and also watch some movies.  
The beds were very comfortable and huge and we slept very well there.
It was vintage during our stay and Russell was so good at ensuring that we were not disturbed; often we didn't even know he was around.  However, after he discovered we were genuinely interested in what was happening, he spent quite a bit of his time explaining everything and was so friendly - it was a highlight of the trip!
Karen was a fantastic host who from the beginning answered all our queries very quickly and was there to greet us when we arrived.  The actual location was super convenient, close to lots of wineries and very peaceful but with only a short drive into the centre of town. We are very much hoping to come back and spend some more time here."
7055506,65561689,2016-03-15,57475174,Chiara,"My stay at Under the Vines was just perfect! I was part of a group of 5 girls that stayed at Karen's cottage and we all loved our time here. Everything was set up beautifully for us, even 'female' themed with pink balloons, chocolates and pink champagne. The cottage has a great living area, separate spacious kitchen and 2 large bedrooms. Beautiful big bathroom too. The back of the cottage overlooks the private vineyard which added to the feel of being in the Barossa wine region. The cottage was in a great spot in the Barossa region, on 5 minute drive to the Tanunda town centre. 
Karen is a wonderful and welcoming host. I wish I could have stayed longer in her beautiful cottage!! "
7055506,66146845,2016-03-20,24417306,Lance,"Under the Vines was an absolutely delightful place to stay. The location was ideal for exploring the Barossa, dining out and relaxing in an ideallic setting. Karen and Russell were marvellous hosts, who ensured we wanted for nothing. We highly recommend staying here and we will be back."
7055506,70566426,2016-04-18,64729289,Hayley,"We loved our time at Under the Vines. When we arrived the kitchen was stocked with milk, eggs, tomato, mushrooms, cereal and some of the best bacon we've had in a long time. Not to mention locally roasted coffee! The house is clean and spacious with a huge shower and spa bath. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, glassware etc. Even had sharp knives! Setting is beautiful being surrounded by a working vineyard (didn't see anyone the whole time so still felt private). It's about 5-10 min drive from Tanunda town centre, which suited us. Seemed to be plenty of taxis around so popping to town for a few drinks with a meal wasn't a problem."
7055506,71502546,2016-04-25,24087877,Tim,"Beautiful property and very welcoming host. We really enjoyed the time, particularly drinking wine on the grass in the middle of a vineyard. The house was warm, tidy, modern and the fireplace was a nice addition for the cool evenings. "
7055506,71983077,2016-04-30,33018208,David,A perfect position and setting in the vines. The house had everything we required and was very well provisioned. Right in the centre of the Barossa. We would definitely come back again.
7055506,80029237,2016-06-15,2320589,Bec,"Karen's cottage was the perfect spot from which to explore the Barossa.  She was very thoughtful about every detail and it made the difference to our stay. The beds are cosy and warm, and the fireplace keeps the whole cottage nice and snug. We had a wonderful time there."
7055506,82675832,2016-06-28,50364030,Tegan,We had a wonderful stay at under the vines. We had absolutely everything we needed and the accommodation was just perfect. We have spent our days since returning lamenting the lack of a fire place and spar bath in our lives. I would highly recommend this property as an ideal location and luxury accommodation in the Barossa! 
7055506,83783390,2016-07-04,15355595,Anita,"Karen's place was absolutely perfect! She made us feel totally at home. 

There was a goodie basket of local produce for breakfast. We had a choice of toast with local jams, muesli, cereal and of course the important bacon and eggs. She'd even left us some orange juice!

The location is great. We thought at first it might be a bit far out of town but it's a very short drive and actually conveniently located between both Tanunda and Angaston. It's set in its own private vineyard. 

The photos don't even do it justice. It was very comfortable with great beds and the best bath!

I would thoroughly recommend Karen's place. Will definitely stay again. "
7055506,88569728,2016-07-24,5673982,Daniel,"We had a wonderful stay at Under the Vines. Karen is an accommodating host, who had a clean house warm and ready with a fridge stocked with delicious food for breakfast. Highly recommend staying here."
7055506,90264935,2016-07-31,78240761,Michael,"A truly wonderful experience. It had all the comforts of home and then some. The breakfast basket was full of local produce ... enough for two days for my wife and I. The woodfire was prepared for us and well stocked for a cosy weekend. The house itself was spotless, well equiped and included a large range of fun things to do. In a great location for getting around the Barossa. All in all, a perfect spot for a romantic weekend."
7055506,104256856,2016-09-25,6480440,Greg,Karen met us just after we arrived and made us feel very welcome. The house had all the amenities and was very clean.
7055506,104660186,2016-09-27,65984814,Sam,"We had an amazing stay at Karen's property in the Barossa. 

The house is situated perfectly, only a short drive away from many restaurants and vineyards. Karen was a great host, met us upon arrival and showed us around the property. 

It has everything you would need for a great stay including fresh food for breakfast, a selection of coffee and milk and every utensil needed. 

Overall it was an amazing stay and would love to stay here again next time we visit SA!"
7055506,107547134,2016-10-10,87459040,Brian,"It is set in vineyards with an amazing country feel to the place. The host displayed generous hospitality in supplying an outstanding locally produced gourmet breakfast. The cottage contained up to date comforts to a very high standard including wireless Internet. A great destination for our wedding anniversary. Well located between Nuriootpa, Tanunda and Angaston. A short drive to all the tourist spots including wineries. "
7055506,109304467,2016-10-20,22508329,Samantha,"Excellent location and beautiful property. Large bedrooms with black out blinds which made having a lay in far too easy! Well stocked Kitchen meant that we were able to cook easily.
We also loved sitting in the garden in amongst the vines watching the sun go down - beautiful! Would definitely return again in future."
7055506,111569254,2016-10-31,27400365,Melanee,Everything we could've wanted (plus more) was there. Very clean and well appointed throughout ... 6ft husband easily relaxed in the spa. Generous thoughtful hosts. Perfect 2 day honeymoon venue.
7055506,114935775,2016-11-20,26812011,Gemma,"Under the Vines is a quaint but luxurious retreat. It feels very private but is just a few minutes' drive from towns, between Nuriootpa and Tanunda. We stayed here on the first really warm weekend of summer and it was a lovely and cool oasis to return to after visiting wineries and other sights. Drawing the thick curtains allows for easy sleep-ins the next morning. The kitchen is very well stocked with excellent local produce for cooked breakfast, including locally roasted beans to use in the coffee machine. Being surrounded by vineyards makes adds to the feeling of having an authentic Barossa experience. Our host Karen was great in her communication, and even offered to post back a pair of sandals and a Lego piece my children left behind! Much appreciated. "
7055506,116248867,2016-11-28,33631662,Michele,"We had a lovely 5 day stay at Karen's Under the Vines cottage. Karen was a fantastic host and very personable. From booking the cottage to greeting us when we arrive, Karen was very responsive. The cottage is lovely and secluded but was only a 5 min drive into Tanunda. I recommend visiting FermentAsian for excellent dining.  The breakfast provision provided were plentiful and very generous and 5 different types of milk to choose from! This airBnB was probably the most well stocked place I have stayed in.  Clearly much thought has gone into what traveller's might need; this place felt like you were visiting someone's house. Thank you for hosting us Karen and i hope many more visitors have the opportunity to discover this lovely area of the Barossa and your lovely hospitality. "
7055506,120438419,2016-12-10,85267799,Jillian,"Karen's cottage was in a great location almost situated halfway between the towns of Tanunda and Anguston. Very quiet location.  Good size cottage although there was only two us.  If two couples stayed, having the toilet in the bathroom, may be a little difficult. However, with just two of us, the bathroom was very adequate. Very comfortable bed.  Two huge bean bags to sit on the lawn, everything very clean and the kitchen well stocked including tasty breakfast goodies.  We had a relaxing week in the cottage."
7055506,120484548,2016-12-10,99949168,Paula,A beautiful place. Loved it!
7055506,122977942,2016-12-26,19430136,Ralph,"Fantastic, comfy and clean home located in a perfectly peaceful and private vineyard, managed by the wonderfully prompt and pleasant Karen. Thank you for helping to make our stay so very memorable. "
7055506,123344682,2016-12-28,49383160,Olga,"Karen is the most attentive and friendly host.  She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around her lovely property.  Communication was extremely easy and efficient.  The cottage is well located just outside Tanunda, with easy and inexpensive cab ride into the town centre. 

The cottage has everything one needs or wants for a comfortable and cosy stay including tasty breakfast provisions from Barossa.  Lovely vineyard views from pretty much every window.  Would definitely return.  "
7055506,127090769,2017-01-15,92190438,David,Awesome place to stay in the Barossa. Amongst the vines at its finest.
7055506,128172849,2017-01-22,69255117,Jessica,"Exceptional host and accomodation. The house is on the outskirts of Tanunda so easy access to everything in town while also feeling secluded and private. Also a quick 10 minute drive to Angaston. Location is fantastic. The house had everything we needed, a big comfy bed, aircon in each room, a big lounge, a huge luxurious bathroom and a great kitchen stocked up by the host with local produce for us. We will absolutely come back to stay here."
7055506,131293446,2017-02-11,23245796,Stephanie,Fabulous accomodation. Would recommend to anyone visiting Barossa. Karen is a great host.
7055506,132092775,2017-02-15,15118435,Warren,"The photos of Karen's Vineyard Cottage on the website don't do it justice at all.  It is very peaceful and quiet. Karen has outfitted the cottage and provided every possible comfort, food and essentials you can think of to make your stay at the cottage very pleasant.  She has exceeded our expectations........definitely 10 out of 10 and beyond :)
The accomodation is suitable for couples and families.
We highly recommend staying at Karen's Vineyard Cottage when you visit Tanunda.  It is also very centrally located but still offers quiet and peaceful surroundings.
Too many details to comment on and the only way to experience what we experienced is to stay at Karen's Vineyard Cottage.  You will not be disappointed.
One of the best BNB's we have stayed in and we have stayed in many BNBs 
 "
7055506,135727848,2017-03-05,25045712,Qing,"What a wonderful experience we had. This place was absolutely amazing! Quiet and scenic. Tucked off the road and with 5 acres of vines, this house was just beautiful.
I can't recommend Karen and the place more. There was everything we need there and it was so close to all the wineries and vineyards. Simply stunning! Can't wait to come back!"

7055506,157913964,2017-06-05,42874720,Drew,Beautiful place with a very friendly host. The wood burning fire place on a cold night was divine. Will stay here next time I'm in the Barossa valley. 
7055506,159869583,2017-06-11,23552332,Gaby,"We had a great stay at Karen's place over the long weekend. The place had everything you need and very close to some really great wineries making it easy to ride around on bicycles for the day.
The fresh produce was lovely, the coffee delicious, access to some port in the barrel also a bonus and the fire being ready in the fireplace a great touch for our wintery getaway.
We couldn't fault our stay in this place and would recommend to all that want to discover the Barossa!"

If only there was nothing else to do in the Barossa, we would have just been happy to enjoy the little home in the vineyard.  Karen greeted us personally and encouraged us to relax and treat ourselves which was easily done.  The country breakfast goodies provided were a delicious start to our day.  Yum.   "
7055506,168996384,2017-07-11,125782542,Rachel,"Lovely, thank-you!"
7055506,171191217,2017-07-17,10106347,Clara,"Under the vines was truly amazing. A location that's central to everything nothing was more than 10-15 mins drive away. You get a well appointed home with plenty of amenities to keep you comfy. The house is tucked away in a little vineyard and the backyard faces a pretty spectacular view. I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast spread that Karen stocked up in the pantry and the fireplace kept us warm throughout our stay. Make sure you lounge in the outdoor beanbags with a blanket, a hot cuppa and a good book. "
7055506,171842987,2017-07-19,138490745,David,"Such a great location and atmosphere. It was a cold wet time we spent in the Barossa, but the warmth and coziness of the wood fire and interior made it so welcoming and comfortable. The little details and effort really made it for me, like extensive fresh and local breakfast ingredients supplied, fireplace built and ready to go, tv and entertainment, and detailed easy to read information about everything in the area. Will definitely be recommending to friends who stay in the Barossa.
10/10!"

7055506,176880642,2017-08-01,52270472,Amanda,"Karens house was DROP DEAD BEAUTIFUL! You're minutes from 30 different wineries, from the shops and restaurants, and just dream like country drives. I highly recommend renting a car so you're able to drive around. Karen leaves several taxi and shuttle information so you can spend a day safely traveling between the wineries. We will definitely be back!"
7055506,190299860,2017-09-04,147602175,Teresa,We loved our stay here. Karen had thought of everything we could possibly have needed. My only regret is that we didn't stay for longer.

7055506,198901110,2017-10-01,11254483,Sarah,"Absolutely gorgeous! 
Karen has gone above and beyond with this little gem! She provided so much fantastic breakfast food! And the barrel of port and chocolates on the bed was a beautiful added touch!
Wouldn't stay anywhere else if we return to the Barossa!"
7055506,201738723,2017-10-09,82041515,David,"Great location, great house and great host!"
7055506,202105363,2017-10-10,50608012,Mark,"My partner and I visit the Barossa often and throughly enjoyed our stay.  We loved being amongst the vines and appreciated the fireplace on a chilly evening.  Karen has thought of everything, especially for breakfast.  And the place was immaculately clean.  We highly recommend the cottage and would definitely love to stay here again on our next visit to the Barossa!"
7055506,203304179,2017-10-14,28273990,Kate,"Had a fantastic stay here! It’s a very comfortable house, well set up, and a beautiful spot amongst the vines. We enjoyed being able to relax outside in the sun during the afternoon. The provided breakfast food was great with both cooked and non-cooked options. Would definitely recommend to friends!"
7055506,204789116,2017-10-20,14620343,Susie,"We stayed at under the vines with our 18mo toddler and had an excellent stay! It is a great location, close to wineries & barossa towns. We loved hanging out in the back yard overlooking the vineyard. Thank you!"
7055506,205340175,2017-10-22,22310367,Nicholas,Everything was perfect! Will definitely be back. Thanks Karen!
7055506,212679110,2017-11-19,18788960,Melanie,"It's all been said before but I'll say it again - great place, great location, great service. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Karen's place. She really has thought of it all - anything you've forgotten she's probably provided a spare! Kitchen stocked, comfortable beds, amazing bath. Delicious breakfast and coffee (although my barista skills didn't do it justice). If this place is available for your dates then I highly recommend booking it while you can!!!"
7055506,219169513,2017-12-16,156689418,Olivia,"Thanks so much for being a great host, really appreciated the quick communication. Loved the little touches of candles and matches, amazing coffee, beautiful breakfast also provided. Easy to relax in, and so easy for day trips out. Thanks so much. We will be back."
7055506,223155441,2017-12-31,23507738,An Liat,"Would have given a 6 stars if there is an option to it.

Karen's place is well situated in the Barossa valley with almost every major vineyard & attractions less than 10mins drive away. With a vineyard just right outside the house, one can enjoy their meals/drinks at the backyard while enjoying the vineyard views. 

And if u enjoy cooking, do look forward to a well stocked full kitchen & the fresh food supplied by Karen for breakfast.

I must say, to have a full Barossa Valley experience, one would have to stay at this place to complete it."
7055506,224956479,2018-01-04,160941945,Chen,"This is the best airbnb house I stayed so far! Karen has gone extra miles to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. This is a lovely house in the vinyard, with thoughtful touches of welcome candies, fresh food, tour information, etc. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to travel to Barossa."
7055506,226299927,2018-01-10,57993767,Louise,"Great location, and rooms are big and clean."
7055506,230297522,2018-01-27,17903140,Michael,Excellent comfortable and well equipped accommodation in a very peaceful location. A former commercial building has been remodelled by the owners as a stylish modern apartment that is genuinely situated amidst the vines.
7055506,230753700,2018-01-28,22826679,Thanh,Karen was really prompt with communication from the beginning. The accommodation is located in close proximity to all the wineries and other attractions in Barossa Valley which was really good as well as the fact that it's in the middle of a vineyard!!! It was such an experience to stay right in the midst of growing grapevines! We wished we could have stayed for longer. Everything was well laid out for us and Karen provided us with amazing breakfast and so many options such as juices and different types of milk!! Air conditioning in every room provided us with so much relief during 43 degree heat days and were on when we arrived. There is a spa and also a tv in the bathroom :) what an experience!!! Karen and  co. thank you so much again for your amazing hospitality. Definitely choose this place if you're heading to Barossa Valley to maximise your experience!
7055506,231180798,2018-01-31,169377445,Anthony,"Really great place to stay - it's very cosy, the breakfast, tea and coffee that were provided were great, and the bluetooth speaker had really good sound which was a bonus!"
7055506,233279364,2018-02-09,14514102,Kerry,"We loved Under the Vines - the photos really don’t do it justice.  I don’t know many places where you can sit in the back garden next to growing vines.  All the little touches made our stay extra special - the chocolates on our bed, the beautiful breakfast supplies (it really was next level) and the ability to check in and out early/late.  This place is great and Karen was delightful.  I highly recommend it."
7055506,234477682,2018-02-12,69163926,Nicholas,"Fantastic stay.  Facilities, location and easy of dealing with Karen just made the stay even better.  highly recommend"

7055506,238992943,2018-02-27,172624653,Stephanie,Karen’s home is a lovely getaway in a gorgeous setting w a vineyard. Two bedrooms make it good value for two couples or a family. Short drive to shops and restaurants. Karen left is some ingredients for a breakfast cook up too - so lovely and thoughtful!
7055506,239695928,2018-03-02,117568125,Chris,"Convenient place to base yourself for the Barossa, lovely being surrounded by the vines!"
7055506,241371758,2018-03-09,52387854,Darren,We had an amazing stay. The house and surrounds are absolutely stunning. 11 out of 10 perfection. 
7055506,242462109,2018-03-12,49918084,James,"2nd time here, loved it just as much as the first.  Great location with all you need for a great time away."

7055506,249298030,2018-04-02,2637716,Priscila,"We had the most amazing stay in Karen's place. The cottage, the grounds and location were superb, but what we loved most were the unbelievably thoughtful touches - fresh bread, local coffee, bathrobes. Just awesome. Thanks for thinking of everything, Karen!"
7055506,251429905,2018-04-08,44124489,Aimee,"Under the Vines is the perfect Barossa getaway! While we felt secluded in this location with plenty of privacy and quiet, it was only a 5 minute drive into Tanunda which was perfect. We enjoyed a lovely afternoon in the sun surrounded by the vineyard enjoying local cheeses and wines. 
Karen is a great host, super prompt with all communication and the little touches left around the place were so thoughtful! 
Our group consisted of 2 couples and this place was big enough that we never felt like we were in each other’s way. 
We would recommend Under the Vines to anyone looking for a Barossa Valley experience!"
7055506,253555655,2018-04-15,108675499,Nicole,Karen was great! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
7055506,254740269,2018-04-18,33000424,Ken,"A beautiful little house, perfect for two couples, great for just the two of us, handy to both Tanunda and Nurioopta. Karen has thought of everything for her guests’ comfort and enjoyment. We’ve stayed at a lot of Airbnb’s here and overseas but none that could match all the little touches Karen has added. Five stars plus another for Karen’s communication and enthusiasm."
7055506,255258053,2018-04-20,3557083,Ros,Fabulous place to stay - clean & cosy with lots of lovely touches. Great location... Secluded but central!

7055506,262152127,2018-05-08,25045712,Qing,"This was our second time staying here. We absolutely LOVE coming back here - the view of the vines is spectacular and Karen really has everything stocked up around the house. It’s all about those little touches - like the local produce for breakfast that she arranges and the local coffee beans. The place has everything you need. It’s so tranquil and secluded but is centrally located so you’re still a short drive away from all the wineries, supermarket and local restaurants and cafes. Can’t wait to come back! :)"
7055506,268398299,2018-05-25,161503967,Luke,Lovely cottage and a very accommodating and hospitable host :)
7055506,275415276,2018-06-11,83822950,Jude,"Karen is an outstanding host, who thinks of the little things to make your stay extra special, from the bowl of Minties on the table, to candles next to the spa. We loved an evening walk through the vineyard and curling up in from of the fire. This is definitely a place that we will come back and will happily recommend to others. "
7055506,279519914,2018-06-21,6564369,Clare,"Thoroughly enjoyable mini escape thanks Karen, we look forward to returning. Loved the location, spa bath, wood fire, brekky goods and your local tips. Perfect winter holiday! We appreciated the porta cot being available also, cheers! "
7055506,282275948,2018-06-27,57445537,Greg,The cottage is beautifully fitted out with everything you could need for a comfortable stay. It is located close to many vineyards and cellar doors and to Tanunda.
7055506,288019803,2018-07-09,22340075,Ruby,"I would highly recommend staying at Under the vines B&B, the place is perfectly located to explore the Barossa valley and is set on a beautiful vineyard. The place was clean and had everything you could think of including a spa, tv, Foxtel, and lovely kitchen. It is the perfect place to relax after spending the day wine tasting and eating!! Karen also sent us a fantastic list of wineries and restaurant recommendations which were much appreciated!!"
7055506,294304344,2018-07-22,42815486,Kristina,The property is set in a vineyard and a little bit out of Tanunda town centre. It is perfectly located for touring the Barossa. Karen is a fabulous host supplying the most amazing breakfast provisions of local produce and setting the fire ready to light in the wood stove upon our arrival. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
7055506,298026311,2018-07-29,52254076,Max,"This is our second stay at Karen's, as we simply had to come back after our first stay was far too short.  This cottage is easily the best we have stayed at in airbnb; Karen is very generous and has everything you could want to have a comfortable stay.  The wood fire and large spa bath was particularly great for our winter  visit. Absolutely lovely, and definitely recommended. "
7055506,302669503,2018-08-06,154786187,Mark,"This place is right in the heart of the Barossa, such an amazing location. A lovely place with with plenty of room and everything you need to enjoy your stay..."
7055506,305827155,2018-08-12,202961881,Rebekah,"This place was killer. Photos don't do it justice. Karen bent over backwards to accurate our needs. Breakfast goods were the best quality as was the port and coffee. Loved every second and wanted to stay forever. This is the place to stay in the Barossa, with that personal touch and vineyard feel ❤"
7055506,309842252,2018-08-19,199117923,David,"Under the Vines is an amazing place to stay, being close to Tanunda. Set on a working vineyard, but so quiet and peaceful with great views. The fireplace in winter is awesome whilst sitting on the lounge and enjoying the surrounds. A great comfortable 2 bedroom place to stay, with a large modern bathroom, with a spa and large double shower."
7055506,312143737,2018-08-23,98342081,Ian,"Beautiful stay in amongst a working vineyard. Clean and quiet with great amenities, beautiful spa and a wood fire heater. It is equal distance to both Tanunda and Nuriootpa but also away from the traffic and very relaxing. Highly recommended!"
7055506,327993001,2018-09-25,213104255,Annie,"We absolutely loved our stay at Under the Vines! Karen had thought of absolutely everything that we could have wanted and needed and so much more! The place is just stunning, and if you are looking to relax and unwind in a beautiful spot of the Barossa, then this is the perfect place!"
7055506,329894075,2018-09-30,8043241,Kara,"The cottage is a unique and peaceful place. The location is perfect for visiting the wineries, and there were so many thoughtful touches like fresh breakfast ingredients and the log fire ready to light. Having a cup of tea in bed looking out on the vines was so relaxing, and we will definitely try to come back!"
7055506,331196113,2018-10-02,46417421,Sheryl,"Thank you Karen, especially for all the lovely breakfast food. As advertised, this gorgeous cottage is truly ""amongst the vines"", and was extremely peaceful and comfortable. We will be back for a longer stay."
7055506,336084129,2018-10-14,17740875,Chris,"Beautiful place nestled amongst the vines, secluded yet very central and close to everything. Great place for two couples or two friends. Karen was very accommodating with early check in and late checkout... also very quick with communicating. There were lovely touches with chocolates and also a large amount of breakfast supplies. Unfortunately we didn’t really take advantage of the fresh ingredients left for a hearty big breakfast. Would definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks again Karen."
7055506,338931854,2018-10-20,46272877,Suzanne,Loved our stay. Very clean and perfect location for us. Karen was very friendly and helpful with suggestions on what to do. Ten out of ten!
7055506,343801343,2018-11-02,218374693,Gareth,"Beautiful place. The building looked small from the outside as you would expect for an Airbnb guest house, but inside its so spacious. The beds and the bathroom are big! Spa bath and double shower are both a treat. Breakfast kit was left in the fridge which was so nice! Wife and I might come back just for the Airbnb.

Only downside is, as mentioned, the bugs. There are quite a few spiders and centipedes and all so if that's a deal breaker for you, be advised.

Definitely would recommend"
7055506,354463628,2018-12-01,71439249,Saranya,"Karen's B&B was a perfect retreat in the Barossa. The two rooms had large beds and ample linen and towels. The bathroom is very large too and is perfect for couples. We had a delicious breakfast daily consisting of fresh vegetables, eggs and bacon with fresh bread and oats. The little touches around the place with the barrel of port make it very divine! Dinner and breakfast with the view of the vineyard made our stay extra special. Would definitely come back !"
7055506,358847681,2018-12-15,204062963,Stuart,Great place to stay and everything you could need!
7055506,365953808,2019-01-02,5248322,Sophie,A fantastic property to use as a base in the Barossa. Stunning surrounds among the grapevines! Really spacious and great spa bath to relax in after a day of exploring. Only a few mins drive from Tanunda and close to lots of excellent wineries. Breakfast ingredients were a lovely touch. Will be back next time we are in the region! Thanks again!
7055506,411865952,2019-02-14,26717046,Joseph,What a great place! The location is so peaceful amongst all of the vines and surroundings. The breakfast package was so welcome before our early start and the spa bath was the perfect way to relax after a long drive. Thanks Karen for such a great stay!
7055506,416690602,2019-02-24,54915598,Nicholas,"Five star ⭐️ 
Excellent experience"
7055506,422361011,2019-03-10,61633331,Dale,"If you come to the Barossa......stay here. The accommodations are perfect, the host Karen is attentive, the setting in a vineyard is exceptional, the location to all that is Barossa is central, and the value is unbeatable."
7055506,425284330,2019-03-17,186170933,Paul,"What a great place to stay in the Barossa. All the amenities (wineries) of the Barossa are a short drive. Under the vines is simply exceptional, I promise you will have a great stay. Paul"
7163755,48793661,2015-09-28,43233618,Jennifer,"Thank you barbie, a lovely place managed by a lovely person. See you next time."
7163755,49068052,2015-09-30,44909070,Thomas,"The hideaway is conveniently located in Tanunda. Booking was very easy and unlike previous reviews you have the apartment to yourself. Excellent lounge, kitchen, and bedroom. Maybe a few small kitchen supplies like olive oil, salt, pepper would make staying there more convenient for the interstate traveller. Excellent value and a good choice in the Barossa"
7163755,49722508,2015-10-05,30872755,Ed,"Barbie was an engaging and lovely host. The accomodation itself is very pleasant, large and very well placed within the Barossa Valley. It's also very conveniently placed in relation to Tanunda's best restaurants."
7163755,49925805,2015-10-07,3304423,Ros And Sean,"We really enjoyed our stay: Barbie is friendly and reliable and the flat is clean, spacious and thoughtfully furnished. The modern kitchen is very well equipped. Location is great for a stroll through town to the many cafes and boutiques."
7163755,50717400,2015-10-13,45270391,Daniel,"Barbie's place is in a great location - it's under a minute's walk to the Tanunda town centre, where you can find the visitor information centre and hire bikes. The unit looks quite plain from the outside, but the wooden flooring and antiquey furniture give the interior pretty nice vibe. We didn't meet Barbie while we were there, but she was super friendly in her messages and even left us some little homemade treats in the fridge! Yum!"
7163755,51650214,2015-10-22,46050614,Stephanie,"What a stay! The hideaway was the perfect little place, clean & tidy, spacious and walking distance to everything in town! I was only there for two nights but definitely would have stayed longer if I could have! Barbie was the perfect host, she even left fresh flowers and a treat in the fridge! She was so lovely in her msgs too, cannot recommend this place enough!! "
7163755,52127786,2015-10-26,28883670,Rachel,"The unit is in a great location in the Main Street of Tanunda but still very quiet at night. It's very spacious and has a new kitchen with everything you need for cooking and some basic supplies such as tea, coffee, milk etc. There were also two huge bunches of freshly picked roses in the dining and kitchen areas which was a beautiful touch (and they smelt gorgeous). Barbara was very quick to respond throughout the booking and check in process which was hassle free. Would not hesitate to recommend Barbara's place and, as I go to the barossa valley 2 or 3 times a year, hope to stay there again myself. "
7163755,52361155,2015-10-28,46750427,Mary,We had a marvelous stay. The unit was exactly as described and emails and text with Barbie was easy and very helpful. Keyless entry made it a very easy check in.. Location was the best ever. Thanks for a great stay in Tanunda
7163755,52626338,2015-10-31,43092258,Brittany,"Barbra was great to work with, very helpful, and answered all our questions within minutes. The listing was as pictured, and a great location. She had fresh roses around the house, which was a lovely touch! My only semi complaint is the bathroom needs a major renovation. Besides that, we loved our stay at the Hideway and would recommend it! Thank you Barbra! "
7163755,52851247,2015-11-02,13157075,Lauren,"Barbie was a brilliant host and so lovely. Everything was so clean and tidy, the house is gorgeous and in the most perfect location. Couldn't have asked for a better stay in Tanunda and to the Barossa Wineries. "
7163755,52986119,2015-11-03,16084503,Grace,"We had a great stay at ""The Hideaway"" - large and comfortable apartment, partly done up/re-painted. Large TV, great kitchen well stocked with equipment/appliances and lemons! Location was excellent - right in the heart of Tanunda and the Barossa. Although we only met via text, Barbara was lovely and very considerate and helpful. Would definitely stay again.  "
7163755,53198842,2015-11-06,46898210,Jay,"Barbara made us feel most welcome with flowers, biscuits and a welcome message on arrival. The accommodation was nice and homely and located in a convenient location near the centre of Tanunda."
7163755,53706863,2015-11-11,8708818,Kate,We had a fantastic time staying at The Hideaway - exactly as described in photos with easy access with arrival out of working hours. Barbie was very helpful and easy to contact. Would definitely recommend to others 
7163755,53836957,2015-11-13,5122300,Maeve,"I stayed at the Hideaway with two friends for one night. We had a wonderful stay in the comfortable and clean accommodation. 
Barbie made it very easy for us to contact her which made for a easy check in with warm welcome of a lovely note. It was a great location within walking distance to everything in Tanunda. I will definitely stay at the Hideaway again when I come back to the Barossa. "
7163755,54200866,2015-11-16,5947325,Jenny,"A welcoming, surprisingly spacious 2 bed room unit, in the middle of Tanunda, completed with fresh roses, a welcome personal card and some supplies for breakfast. Nothing was forgotten, and nothing was required. The unit was true to its description and better than we thought it would be.  We will definitely be coming back. 
"
7163755,54318970,2015-11-18,14744119,Andrew,"Barbara was extremely welcoming and took the time to write us a welcome card, very appreciated. The place was big, nice and clean, very comfortable and close to all the wineries. "
7163755,54448127,2015-11-20,4277452,Michael,"A lovely, comfortable little hideaway on Tanunda's main street. Close to shops, restaurants and a good pub and of course all those lovely vineyards. Comfortable beds and a good kitchen. When we arrived we found that Barbara had filled the unit with fresh roses. A nice touch as was the packet of locally made palmier biscuits. Can recommend The Club Hotel, 1918 (restaurant) and Finos restaurant at Seppeltsfield."
7163755,54631355,2015-11-22,47938699,Edward,"Barbara made us very welcome and was flexible with the check in and check out.
The Hideaway was in a quiet end of Tanunda and was what we expected.  Well worth a visit while in the Barossa."
7163755,54870542,2015-11-25,12750195,Diana,The Hideaway is a lovely house exactly as described by Barbie. It is in a central location so it is easy to explore Tanunda on foot. Bedrooms are all a good size and there was plenty of room for 5 of us. The house is beutifully presented and Barbie was a great host. It felt very much a home away from home. We had a great stay exploring the Barossa region! 
7163755,55391863,2015-12-01,16028247,Laura,"Barbie was great, and the location excellent - right in the center of Tanunda and crawling distance from great coffee shops, restaurants etc.  The house was lovely, I wish we had time/ inclination to make better use of the beautifully appointed kitchen.  The bathroom was definitely in need of a refurb, but all perfectly serviceable.  The cottage was spotlessly clean, although some elements definitely on the rustic side. I would absolutely recommend."
7163755,55720657,2015-12-05,27920612,Judith,"From the beginning, this was a very successful stay. Barbara was always prompt to respond to queries during the booking process, before we arrived and during our stay. The house was perfect for our needs. The supermarket next door, the top class restaurants close by, the quiet, plus the location in the heart of the Barossa Valley, all contributed, but the house itself was great. Spacious, with everything we needed, very well equipped for a much longer stay than our two night break. We appreciated the welcoming flowers, biscuits and card. All in all, we could not fault our stay. The WiFi did not work initially, but Barbara responded instantly to my message and sorted that out."
7163755,56195898,2015-12-10,48541605,Nikki,Barbara was the perfect hostess. Unit was lovely. Great location. Had a fabulous trip to Tanunda.
7163755,56480732,2015-12-14,37362084,Paul,"Good, clean unit in the middle of Tanunda. 
Great looking location for a weekend in the Barossa. 
Barbie was a great host. "
7163755,56793529,2015-12-18,24714210,Mark,"A lovely welcome with a delicious bottle of wine, chocolates and biscuits.

The consideration for guests is excellent, there was a lovely welcome note and gift and a full range of extra's that make it all feel like home.  There was a lot of brochures and local information provided too for visitors.  Barbara contacted us to make sure we arrived ok and to offer help if needed.  It was so great to be in central Tanunda, this is the perfect location so convenient to be able to walk quickly to the supermarket or into the other restaurants and shops in this very cute town.  Most of all I felt The Hideaway absolutely great value accommodation, it's roomy, cute and comfortable with homely touches and a considerate host and I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Tanunda."

A highly desired location to make the most of your time in the Barossa as its a stones throw to everything eg. 2min walk to fermentasian and 1918, food land and a dvd shop. Barbara provides a lovely warm welcome to the area too. "

7163755,116691513,2016-12-02,49317775,Patrick,Barbara has a great place in the heart of the Barossa. Off street parking really is not an issue and there are some great coffee shops within walking distance. Most of the wineries are a short drive away. The chocolates and biscuits on arrival were a really nice touch.
7163755,117101137,2016-12-04,93924181,Keeley,"Overall, we were happy with our stay and the great location in Tanunda."
7163755,122952681,2016-12-26,34514642,Angie,When we first arrived the kitchen was full of ants. Luckily there was ant spray there and my husband removed the open sugar and sprayed and that took care of it. We arrived on a day when it was super hot 41C and instructions explicitly say only press the on/off button for the A/C. Well after two hours after pressing the start button it was still miserably hot in there. As we were unable to get a hold of Barb at the time we pressed buttons to make the a/c work thank goodness. The unit is in a central location in Tanunda. 
7163755,123357534,2016-12-28,38023805,Smylee,A beautiful house in the heart of Tanunda. We had a wonderful stay between Christmas & New Years. It's very well decorated with all amenities. Barbara communicated very promptly and clearly.  We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend!! x

The house was cozy, beautiful and met all of our requirements. The master bedroom is spacious and the living areas are comfortable. Barbara was easy to communicate with and the check in/check out procedure was super easy. We highly recommend this property for your next visit to the Barossa Valley!"
7163755,125074920,2017-01-03,6191402,Debra,"Great location, very spacious unit and good value for money.  1918, several cafes, health food store, grocery and other amenities all within easy walking distance.  Nice and quiet location.  Street parking is not an issue.  Great to have keyless entry.  Also, Barbara is super responsive and keen to offer any assistance if required!!
Worth noting that unit is actually one bathroom (w seperate toilet), not 1.5 as described on airbnb.  Also, if requiring wifi, it's very slow (I suspect this is standard for any place in Barossa... but Telstra 4 g works well). Kitchen is a bit lightly furnished, so perhaps a challenge if planning to cook much... ( for example, no cutting boards, strainers, sharp knives, or usual amenities like al foil, plastic wrap, paper towels, spices, etc...
Ideal for a couple for 2-3 nights... can't beat the location, convenience and the serenity!

7163755,147110417,2017-04-25,21894704,Jonathan,So central to Tanunda and district - a full scale apartment with excellent facilities. Watch parking the car as neighbour annoyed at closeness to their driveway!
7163755,150008420,2017-05-07,52274014,Hilary,We had a lovely stay at this air bnb in tanunda. It was well equipped with everything we could have needed and had some great little suggestions of things to do. The house was spacious and clean and the host was lovely and accommodating. We would definitely recommend this house for anyone staying in Tanunda. It was also central to everything as it was located in the Main Street with lots of lovely cafes nearby.
7163755,153331079,2017-05-20,20132995,Jessica,"Everything as described, clean and comfy!"
7163755,155317729,2017-05-28,60696712,Anna,The Hideaway was a fantastic base for our weekend in the Barossa. Really easy to get to everything and great communication. Thank you for having us :)
7163755,159877983,2017-06-12,32717786,Ren,Excellent location! Clean and easy. Really comfy bed. Take washing powder if you want to use wash machine.

Foodland is right next door and proved very useful for our breakfast supplies! We used the home as a base to explore the surrounding wineries. Highly recommended to anyone wishing to do the same"
7163755,164593600,2017-06-28,67256626,Joanna,"Three friends and I stayed at Marie-France's place for 2 nights in June. The description and photos of the house are very accurate. We felt the best features were:

- location: very close to cafes, supermarket, restaurants, shops, ATM machines, bus stop and visitor information centre
- house is clean, spacious, well stocked and furnished
- easy to correspond with Marie-France

We'd highly recommend the place, probably one of the best airbnb options you will be able to find in Tanunda! If you aren't driving and would like to visit the wineries make sure you join a tour or have someone to take you around (one of our Uber drivers from Adelaide was happy to take us around for the day) as there are no Ubers or Taxi's in Tanunda and the wineries are not within walking distance of one another. 

Thanks Marie-France for sharing your house with us!"
7163755,165772293,2017-07-02,116906301,Bill,"We had wonderful stay at Marie-Frances house. It was such a wonderful location and the accommodation was well equip, clean and ready for check-in. Staying here meant we were so close to all the shops, cafes and amenities.  

Car hire is a must,however, many of the vine yards are within easy cycle distance. Check out the visitor centre (about 5 mins walk from the house) for full details of the locate area and cycle hire.

If you don't fancy eating at home there are plenty of very affordable places to eat within walking distance.

I would stay here again!"
7163755,169860973,2017-07-14,127337504,Monique,"A perfect smaller place where my partner and i were able to access all areas of the barossa and near by locations. Recommend based on all near by amenities and services, limited public transport in the Barossa though, so would recommend hiring a car"
7163755,170584413,2017-07-16,6566402,Samantha,Fabulous place .... well positioned and as photos.  Very clean and very comfy .... was here with two friends and we had a lovely time exploring the Barossa from here. Thank you
7163755,175884063,2017-07-30,15757604,Janneke,"Very central location, good for access to groceries and local bakeries. It would be ideal to hire a car to access a wide variety of vineyards throughout the barossa. Very comfortable bed. Check wifi details prior to checking in as it did not work for us."
7163755,179192124,2017-08-07,59543975,Lloyd,"Great location near shops and restaurants. Went to ferment for dinner and was great. 

Apartment was clean and tidy. Access was easy via and coded entry. Good manual.

Bed was a bit soft and shower wasn't very powerful for my liking. But these are minor things. Overall excellent stay."
7163755,185894742,2017-08-23,34094058,Paul,"Brilliant property if you are looking to spend some time checking out the wineries in the Barossa. Much better than staying in any comparable accommodation around the area. Short walk to the shops and the brilliant restaurant, 1918. If you're game, there are three wineries in walking distance too."
7163755,187935034,2017-08-28,51719819,Dustin,"Thanks Marie-France for letting us stay in your unit. It's in a great location - next door to awesome shops & restaurants. The home is just as seen in the pictures, and we had a great time."

7163755,194427510,2017-09-17,110763755,Heather,Walking distance to everything in Tanunda. Shower has poor pressure. Yard needs a good tidy up. Great location

7163755,201181879,2017-10-08,31253531,Dave,Simple house to explore and make the most of the amazing region
7163755,202102163,2017-10-09,5990890,Renee,"Marie-France's place was in a great spot, within walking distance from anything you might need. The unit itself was very unassuming from the outside but quite charming once inside. The kitchen is nice and new, though the bathroom is a little dated. The main bedroom is very large and there is plenty of space in the unit despite looking like quite small from outside, it also has a little outdoor space which was nice to use to sit out in the sun. Be weary of moving around in the night because the floorboards are quite loud and may wake up others in the house! Overall, we had a lovely stay and would recommend."
7163755,203330255,2017-10-15,70876145,Daphne,A great place to stay. Very comfortable and great location.

7163755,208731068,2017-11-02,64695905,Joanne,Be aware that this property is not value for money although the location is good you will not be able to secure your vehicle even though there is the facility to do so.  Be prepared to carry your luggage for 40meters plus.  The interior is old and has not been upgraded with run down furniture and the kitchen is not well equipped.
7163755,209270830,2017-11-05,54895760,Aonghais,Great place and ideal location.  Grocery store and restaurants within a couple hundred meters of the house.

Yes the bathroom is a bit dated but I found it perfectly comfortable and clean. Lots of extra blankets and pillows provided and a heap of brochures about local sights to see. Would not hesitate to recommend the property to a friend.

Very central to town (definitely walking distance to the Main Street - it’s sort of in the Main Street!) It has a beautiful sunny courtyard, a light airy kitchen, both beds are comfy and one bedroom is very generous in size. Excellent shower. Heating was excellent. 

The unit was spacious and reasonably well appointed (although may struggle to cook a full evening meal in the kitchen).

Our host was excellent - very good communication! We encountered a slight issue when we arrived at the property but the host went above and beyond to rectify that for us (which she did) - you can’t ask for more than that!

We would definitely recommend a stay here!"

7297171,45221243,2015-08-31,23689788,Tim,"We absolutely loved our stay at Kathryn and Johns place over a long weekend in August. We were made to feel very much at home and they were very helpful with questions we had. They were so generous to  offer to take us to a local wine show which was one of the highlights of our trip. The house is an old classic with high ceilings and lots of room. The room itself was large, the bed was very comfortable and it had stunning views out over the acreage and some vineyards. The property is in angaston, a pretty little town in the barossa valley which is a short drive to many surrounding vineyards.
Would recommend to anyone looking for a more authentic experience when experiencing the barossa valley."

I would highly recommend it!"
7297171,49539464,2015-10-04,45049317,Teresa,Glad we found this beautiful home to stay in. Jonathan and Kate were very welcoming and allowed us the use of their home as if we were long time friends. Their home is close enough to stroll into the main street of Angaston and still be surrounded by picturesque vineyards and hills typical of the Barossa. We'd love to return.
7297171,49949064,2015-10-07,42895481,Emma,"Staying at Pembury Homestead was a delight. The hosts were friendly and warm, conversation flowed with ease and the facilities extremely comfortable.

Because we were there for an overnight stay only, and had to leave early the next morning, we didn't get a chance to properly explore the area. Maybe next time. Thank you for having us."
7297171,52450010,2015-10-29,12006404,Vanessa,"We really enjoyed to stay in Jonathan's house - it was great! Our room was lovely, cozy, spacious and clean. Sharing kitchen and bathroom was never an issue. Jonathan even made the barbecue place ready for us and we could enjoy our dinner in a wonderful garden with marvellous views! Jonathan and his wife were great, easygoing and charming hosts! They had plenty of good advices for us. They have to dogs: An older quiet one and a younger wild one. Even if he jumps up on you he will not harm you. Both are friendly dogs. Angaston itself is a small and lovely village that we liked very much. There is a good butcher, cheese store, bakery and café. Angaston is well situated to explore the barossa valley. We would definitely come back - we felt really comfortable!"
7297171,52602342,2015-10-31,41122217,Amy,"We had an enjoyable stay at Jonathan's place. Jonathan and Kate are very friendly. The location of the house is quite convenient. There are few supermarkets and restaurants around the area. The room is very spacious, comfortable and clean. We had a great time exploring in their backyard to find their alpacas and sheep. I will recommend Jonathan's place to everyone who wants to spend a night in  Barossa Valley. Thank you Jonathan and Kate."

7297171,54358241,2015-11-18,49034319,John,"Our experience with Jonathan  and his family was fantastic from the moment we made our (first Airbnb) booking.
They made us feel entirely at ease, and we instantly felt as though they were good friends.

The room and amenities are great, in a peaceful and quiet environment.

Jonathan is a great source of local knowledge, and can help with tours if needed.

Bailey the dog deserves a better reputation than what Jonathan gives him!"
7297171,54856182,2015-11-25,22962667,Sisi,"Jonathan and Kate along with the teens (James and Georgia) and dogs (Baxter and Sally) are absolutely lovely. 

Jonathan has a fountain of knowledge of local attractions and hidden gem. We were very fortunate to get all the travel recommendations from him. 

The place itself is antique as Barossa and fully equipped with everything the travellers would need. 

Overall, I highly recommend the space to anyone heading up to Barossa/Eden valleys or surrounding towns. "

Our room was spacious, with a beautiful outlook and comfortable bed with lovely linen. We enjoyed relaxing in their formal lounge. It was a treat to see inside of a beautiful old farmhouse like theirs. 
The share bathroom was not a problem. The location is very handy to eateries and wineries. We specifically wanted somewhere close to the Barossa Farmers Market, so this was perfect. Thank you Jonathan and Kate for sharing your lovely home with us. "

7297171,57284983,2015-12-24,43063086,Leena,"Jonathan was a great host and ensured our stay was very comfortable. He even organised a baby cot at no charge. We had the run of the beautiful house and gardens, our toddler could play with the dogs; altogether it felt like a home away from home. The location of the house is perfect to explore the Barossa and surrounds. Shops are a short walk away and Jon recommended several great wineries. His Barossa Taste Sensations wine tour was fantastic and I can recommend it highly to discover hidden gems of wineries! Thank you for making our holiday memorable and we'll definitely be back.

Their property was like a country escape; it felt cosy and safe, and the room and facilities were clean. Jon was very knowledgeable about the region and recommended excellent wineries to visit. Angaston centre is just a 5-10 minute walk where there are great cafes. There is a neat biking/walking track very close to the property which would be perfect if you were keen on biking around town or travelling town to town. I would highly recommend Pembury homestead for your next stay in the Barossa valley. "

They shared an evening meal with me and even took me to meet friends of theirs one evening for pizza.  Great time!  The house is old and has a lot of character which I liked.  Very quiet area which is perfect if you want some peace and quiet.  They have 2 dogs but the youngest one is the one you'll see most and he is very playful.  Jon and Kate are great hosts and are more than willing to share information about the Barossa Valley.  I would most definitely go back and stay with them again if given the chance.  Thanks to both of them for a memorable stay.
7297171,62835892,2016-02-17,56333549,Angela And Brian,"Wonderful hosts!  Jonathan and Kate gave us great recommendations for the area for wine and food.  We loved the Barossa valley.

7297171,66226016,2016-03-20,26001604,Simone,"Jonathan and Kate are very welcoming hosts. They have to lovely dogs (and livestock). Contact was comfortable and very interesting. 

The room is spacious with high ceilings and very complete (desk, small sofa, tea maker, closet and of course a bed). The bed was reasonably comfortable, but if your partner is tossing and turning this could shake you up quite a bit. We could also make use of the lounge across the hall, with a very homey atmosphere a large sofa and a tv set (we did not try this) and some touristic brochures. It seems the hosts have their own living, so we had this room to ourselves. You can use the coffee maker in the kitchen and store your supply in the fridge. We had our dinner and breakfast in the garden, which is a very romantic setting. 

It's a 10 minute walk to the village center with a restaurant, a supermarket and other shops and the like. On Saturday morning there is a farmers market one village down, good to stock up before you head further North. 

The place is clean and a pleasant space to be. "

The house and gardens were so beautiful and we wish we could've stayed for longer. Highly recommend staying with Kate and Jonathan for a lovely country Australia experience. 
"
7297171,68497370,2016-04-05,24937762,Carolyn,Jonathon and Kate were there to welcome us when we arrived. Their home is in a wonderful location- very close to Angaston- and was even more beautiful than expected. We spent some time chatting with them in the evening but they were very easy going and we would have felt comfortable enough to do our own thing if we wished. As our time in the area was very limited the tips that they gave us made this short time very special. We would definitely recommend a stay with Jonathon and Kate.
7297171,70461854,2016-04-17,11833720,Maria,"Jonathan and Kate have a brilliant home with lots of character. They were very friendly and engaging with great local advice.

I really hope we get another opportunity in the near future."

Dogs were very friendly and too. Jon knows all the local wineries and their food platters and recommended some first class places. The farmers market on Saturday was excellent. The bike track to Nurriutpa goes right past their house and was a nice 2 hour round trip. Pembury and the grounds are lovely and peaceful with amazing gum trees and vineyards.  Recommend to anyone.

After going out for dinner, we returned to the house & were invited to join them & their friends around a bonfire. It was such a great country experience. I would recommend this place to everyone, we had the best stay! Such a comfortable bed too - had the best nights sleep. Thanks so much Jonathan & Kate!"
7297171,84828974,2016-07-09,19309533,Catherine,"We loved Jonathan and Kate's homestead in the Barossa and it was the highlight of our accommodation in South Australia. Their home is cosy, clean, warm (in Winter) and has everything you would need for a few days in the valley.

Both Jonathan and Kate were warm and friendly, assisting us with recommendations in the area (wineries, restaurants, towns nearby). We would happily stay here again. Thanks again"

The house is beautiful, comfortable and super cosy. I absolutely LOVED the living room with the fireplace, and the two super friendly dogs !!

Highly recommended !"

Situated right in the centre of the Barossa it was a short drive to most places and you can even walk down to Angaston. Communication before we arrived was great. Jonathan and Kate are very friendly hosts and we enjoyed our time there very much. Just missing the downpour of rain we had the opportunity to wander around their property with their dogs, alpacas and sheep one afternoon which we loved. A nice and cosy house!

We enjoyed our stay at Pembury Homestead. The room is as per the photo - high ceiling, clean and spacious for two (just right for three). There are plenty of power outlets for your electronics too.  The view from the window was very great (it was cold and wet the day we arrived so we didn't go explore the garden). 

We went to Pindarie Wines based on Jonathan and Kate's recommendation and we weren't disappointed - one of the best meals we had in SA!

Overall an excellent experience!"
7297171,127911626,2017-01-21,24394294,Roz,"I have had the most wonderful stay at Kate and Jonathan's family home. Their cottage is set with beautiful vines in their back garden. Their historical home is truly unique, with great character. Kate and Jonathan have been the best hosts, insuring I had the best time during my stay. They were forthcoming with recommendations, which allowed me to really make the most of my short stay at the Barossa. Their children were so lovely, and mustn't forget their 2 gorgeous dogs. The highlight for me, was sitting in their back garden one evening, enjoying a glass of wine with Kate and Jonathan. They helped make my short stay a memorable one. I can't thank them enough! Best place to stay in the heart of the Barossa Valley."
7297171,160191008,2017-06-13,109775069,Stella,"Thank you to Jonathan and Kate who couldn't offer me their beautiful room but organised for me to stay at their neighbour's. It was a leap of faith for me but I was nit (Website hidden by Airbnb) was fantastic!

5 STAR HOSTS!:)"
7297171,192125883,2017-09-10,23174829,Richard,"Jonathan & Kate's property is about as picturesque as you can get. You could be in Europe if the gums were pines or oak!
 
They have alpacas sheep and a goat that thinks it is a sheep!

They are a warm friendly couple, so much so that we invited them to join us for dinner on the Saturday evening.

The only drawback was the shared bathroom, but to me that was a minor issue.

Excellent value for money!"

7297171,220567035,2017-12-23,152104390,Joy,"Pembury Cottage is a beautiful relaxing and homely environment, decorated simply, but so stylishly. Every room had such lovely charm. We felt at home and relaxed with hosts who were able to detect our need for some conversation but also recognised our need for time out and space. That is quite a skill. We loved riding around the Barossa on our bikes and coming home to the gorgeous kitchen to cook in with all the necessary things at hand, or wander down the Main Street in Angaston and eat out at a restaurant. The relaxed nature of the holiday in an area like the Barossa meant we could do as much or as little as we wanted and either was great. You will not be disappointed. Pembury Cottage and its owners take the guess work out of whether you will have a good time...all you need is here, the rest is up to you."
7297171,224381419,2018-01-03,7156496,Jr,"Very nice and communicative hosts with a nice space in the heart of the Barossa valley. Although it was a short stay, we benefited greatly from the wealth of local knowledge that Jonathan and Kate shared with us.

Their drive is literally on the bike trail which takes you all the way to Gawler. If you choose to do the bike ride there is nothing better than getting back for a shower and hitting Angastons restaurants ( 5min walk), then taking a bottle back to the house and chilling out overlooking the hills for the rest of the evening."
7297171,237963790,2018-02-24,158186525,Alan,Pembury Cottage is very tastefully furnished. Bright and contemporary. Excellent for restful stay and we’ll positioned for tours of Borossa Valley. Angaston a great little town

Very kid friendly for our bouncy two year old, he loved playing with the doggies Baxter and Sally!

The location in Angastan is great for exploring the Barossa, it's a really lovely little town with good restaurants and cafes etc, and more charm than nearby Tanunda. Highly recommend a stay here, especially for the rate offered!"

The location is great, with a view of fields of vines that lets you see a small part of the beauty of the barossa with out being too far from the town of Nuriootpa, which is a great place to base from as some of the best winery's and restaurants in the barossa are just round the corner. 
Overall I can't recommend staying here enough. Our host Jannine was helpful and welcoming from the begining and the place is stunning."
7536235,193007354,2017-09-12,23048826,Stef,"The Old Garage is amazing. From the moment you open the door you'll be blown away by how unique and special this place is. Mark and Jannine are fantastic hosts. Generous. Thoughtful, and unique. 
Stop reading and just click ""book""."

7536235,216820428,2017-12-06,113753049,Neale,Refreshingly different in the beautiful Barossa Valley. Added an extra layer of fun to our trip.  We have no hesitation in recommending this accommodation.
7536235,291478560,2018-07-16,10263595,Amy,"Absolutely amazing from before we even arrived!

We were a last minute booking. Jannine was responsive straight away, first with a lovely introductory phone call to explain a shortly followed message detailing all we needed to know and more! She was incredibly helpful providing information and organising a requested wine tour for the following day. We immediately felt in good hands.

Communication was prompt and excellent, right up until we arrrived. The hosts let you know that they are there for anything you need, just a phone call away. Otherwise, you are courteously left uninterrupted to enjoy your stay. 

When we arrived and walked through the doors, it was like going back in time! The retro decor, the specifically sourced & collected memorabilia, it felt like being in Happy Days! - with the added luxury of updated mod appliances! We took videos of our excitement entering the property, you really can't explain it through words - it has to be experienced! Having the music playing for our entry added a really special touch to everything!

The attention to detail in providing the whole experience for guests cannot be ignored, not just the music playing on arrival but! the coins on the counter for the pinball machine, the fully stocked fridge with local produce - milk, fruit, yoghurt, real butter, mushrooms, tomatoes, bacon & eggs, juice! Fresh bread and multiple condiments! Tea, spices, sugar - a real coffee machine that grinds fresh beans - chocolate! Port! Stocked popcorn machine and coke machine! 

TV's in every room. The beds are amazing, so comfortable. The Spa bath! Devine! Everything is stocked and ready to go, very clean and perfectly placed & displayed! You just need to rock up!

Mark was such a great escort for the wine tour and we really cannot recommend him enough. His local knowledge and love for his backyard really shines, he is hospitable & intune to guests needs, with a great sense of humour to match! A real Aussie legend. The winery tastings were amazing, the food platters so good, the views to die for! Definitely going back. 

We highly, HIGHLY, recommend a getaway to the Old Garage! Even if retro isn't your thing, give it a go! It will take your breath away! It's cool, it's different, it's unforgettable. Try it out for yourself, play some old records and relax, book a wine tour! You really won't be disappointed! 

Huge thank you to Jeannine and Mark for unforgettable, memory making, fantastic weekend escape. Was just what we needed, and then some!!! Look forward to visiting again.

The house is lovely, comfortable, spacious and warm (and so clean).  I have to make special mention of the very very comfortable bedding!
Even though you're sharing Maryann's home,  she doesn't impose herself on your stay and the space provided is very private and secure - you can have as much or as little interaction as you please.
My only regret is that we didn't stay longer.  Maryann even had cheese, olives and chocolate waiting for us :)  I'll be back next visit to the Barossa.  Thanks again Maryann."

Although we only stayed for the night, they were always happy to help out if we needed or available to ask questions. Their place felt very homey and comfortable. It’s close to the Main Street. Would definitely stay here again!"
8053447,248176165,2018-03-31,174701000,Rachel,"A lovely, thoughtfully planned place to stay with small extras which are much appreciated for travellers. Comfy beds, spare toothpaste, toothbrushes, panadol etc. should you need it. Different kinds of teas and milks, chocolate and lots of info about local places all makes for a great stay. Highly recommend!"

8053447,253593054,2018-04-15,78451919,Ashleigh,"Very clean and tidy. Would definitely go back and stay. There was only one thing I wasn't a huge fan of and that being that the accommodation is at the front of their house and there is just a sheet up in the hallway separating the accommodation from the hosts but didn't hear a peep from them. But for the price can't really complain, didn't bother us really as we were just sleeping there. All in all, really nice!"
8053447,263801707,2018-05-13,32658918,Lynette,"Fantastic place and location. Great for an overnight stay. Great bathroom and outdoor area, with a really cute garden. Loved the nibbles and the sparkling wine, that was a great welcome... thank you"

Great for a short stay. 
For a longer stay would strugle not having a kitchen area. But that is just me."

8053447,344592302,2018-11-04,6892118,Natalie,Maryann's place is super comfortable and has lots of thoughtful touches. Snacks and drinks in the fridge on arrival. The beds were comfortable and the house was very close to walk into town for dinner. Hands down best Airbnb I have stayed in yet.

8053447,427532600,2019-03-24,42525219,Cassie,We had an amazing stay here. Great location and so nice and quiet. Would definitely recommend to anyone going to the Barossa to stay here. We will be back!!
8153197,46985046,2015-09-14,1823405,Trudy,"Upon arrival Christa greeted us with the key, showed us around the attached cottage and then presented us with a hot freshly made orange cake ! A country welcome indeed.
This is an old cottage which is attached to the main farm house, but is self- contained.  It has it’s own entrance and when you sit on the verandah at the back your view is of a field of vines.
The bathroom is huge and old fashioned, but the water is hot with good pressure.
The kitchen does not have a stove, but has an electric frypan, in which you can fry your fresh farm eggs which they give you.
When we went it was cold, so it was lovely to sit around the log fire which was set up for us.
Everything was very clean and we had a most enjoyable stay of one night.
"
8153197,48758671,2015-09-28,42358141,Junshuo,Lovely stay ! Thank you for your hospitality.

Had everything we could've wanted.
"
8153197,56157973,2015-12-09,39503528,Fiona,"Spacious and comfortable, it was very hot when we were there but the cottage was nice and cool.  We got to enjoy a thunderstorm from the verandah and watch the galahs enjoy it. Christa was very generous with food supplied. Great stay."
8153197,58175375,2016-01-01,4795539,Alex & Dina,Christa was the perfect host! Very welcoming and friendly. The house is very spacious with a nice terrace overlooking the vineyards. Christa left a bowl of berries freshly picked from their garden on the kitchen table and shared their handmade paté with us! Just delicious!! Lovely experience - a great spot to spend time in Barossa Valley. 
8153197,59315692,2016-01-09,39654927,Jim,"Naimanya cottage was a fantastic stay. A good location close to all the wineries. Comfortable and serene. Definitely would go back for more. 

"
8153197,60486481,2016-01-24,4984577,Kristel,"Loved our stay, Christa and Leon were lovely, really enjoyed morning visits from their beautiful dog Rusty."
8153197,63220657,2016-02-21,8251594,Benjamin,"We'd recommend Christa's place to anyone looking for cozy, low key accommodation. We stayed three nights with our 11 month old son and felt right at home. Everything was clean, well looked after, thoughtfully prepared, comfortable and incredibly welcoming. 

The location is fantastic on top of the hill, with easy access to amazing wineries and local eateries a short drive away.

The breakfast foods that Christa supplied were all high quality, local products, including beautiful eggs from her own chickens.

We enjoyed checking out the chickens, sheep and bulls grazing in the paddock and our son absolutely adored their very excitable dog, Rusty.

Thank you Christa, we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly and appreciate your hospitality at this very busy time of the year for winemakers."
8153197,65014459,2016-03-10,6361710,Thom,Staying at Christa's unique farm stay was one of the best airbnb experiences I've had! Christa and rusty went out of their way to make us feel at home immediately. We can highly recommend it for a unique Barossa experience.
8153197,65767701,2016-03-17,11669008,David,"The cottage is a beautiful little place on a farm/vineyard outside town.    Sitting on the back porch and having breakfast watching the sun rise over the vineyard was one of our best memories of the trip.  It's a little bit of a drive to the big winery areas but no big deal and a scenic road for the most part.  Owners are wonderful and very nice, gave us lots of recommendations about the area and things to do, and of course about wine!  Breakfast is included but is ""cook your own"", Christa gave us a nice assortment of local eggs, bacon, bread, coffee, etc and we made our breakfast on our own schedule.  Kitchen is small but adequate, no real stove just electrics.

The house itself is cute but very old, like 1860's old.  The owners live in the other half of the building which is one of several additions to the original house.  If I had any complaint about the place it's that the bathroom probably dates to shortly after the invention of indoor plumbing.  Perfectly usable and not an issue for us, but if you're sensitive to that sort of thing it's the only complaint I have.  We would definitely consider staying here again if we're ever back in the Barossa Valley."
8153197,66044545,2016-03-19,54428481,Rita,The host made us feel very welcome.Friendly and accomodation was much larger than I expected.Good sized rooms Beds very comfortable.Well equiped.Beautiful views and so close to 2 small towns with excellent eateries.
8153197,66870876,2016-03-25,11768376,Grant,"If you don't feel you would enjoy peace and quiet in a wonderful location, waking up to birdsong at sunrise straight out over vineyards from you verandah, wonderful hospitality with fresh breakfast produce (outstanding local bacon, eggs etc), then this may not be th place for you!! As for us we wish we had more time to enjoy the area and hospitality shown by our hosts and would hope to return again when next visiting from the UK."
8153197,73914075,2016-05-11,63030976,Lynne,"
Great place to stay, large airy rooms, lovely open fire and the view over the Vineyard is charming. Christa is a welcoming and generous host, setting the fire every day and making sure all provisions are stocked up. It was blowing a gale on one of our days and Christa had thoughtfully put the heater on soo when we arrived back cold and damp it was lovely and warm "
8153197,74556308,2016-05-15,9860797,Billy,"Great location with easy access to vineyards and towns of the Barossa region.Lovely setting on a working farm,complete with adorable kelpie.Christa made us feel very welcome with a well stocked kitchen and fridge,which was replenished daily.Lots of information about local attractions from Christa herself and written material.The cottage itself is cosy and  comfortably accommodates two couples.Would love to visit again and stay longer."
8153197,83523829,2016-07-03,24771774,John,"We had a delightful stay at Naimanya Cottage. The Cottage was just as shown in the pictures and about a 10-15 minute drive out of Tanunda. Access to vineyards and other Barossa attractions was all pretty easy. Being on a working farm/vineyard added to the charm. Christa was an excellent host - great with communication about the booking, and gave us really good directions on how to the somewhat remote cottage. She provided bacon, eggs, tomatoes, mushrooms, milk, cereals, tea, coffee, fruit, fresh bread etc each day. We had an open fire each night was a real winner!   We would definitely stay here again."
8153197,86408313,2016-07-16,9252024,Colin,Thanks Christa for the opportunity for a quiet and relaxing holiday. The cottage was very clean and the fridge well stocked with all that was needed for a hearty breakfast. We used the open fire every day and appreciated the continually replenished supply of wood.  
8153197,91352557,2016-08-05,77398488,Lynda,"I wanted a quiet place to relax and the stay at Naimanya provided exactly that. The provisions were great and we wanted for nothing. Included was a lovely german cake. While it was slightly off the beaten track it was only a short drive to some of the best restaurants and attractions. Having a fire set up for the evening was great, there is nothing nicer than a warm fire to end the day."
8153197,95692426,2016-08-20,65289886,Dace,"We loved staying at Christa's B&B. A simple but very charming place; warm and cosy with delightful views across a vineyard, garden and farmland. Christa was so easy to talk to you & supplied more fresh eggs, fruit, vegetables, bread and cake than we could eat. We'd recommend it to anyone."
8153197,99383690,2016-09-04,21228651,Steve,"Christa was very welcoming and accommodating, we had a very secluded and relaxed break at Naimanya Cottage. "
8153197,102322401,2016-09-17,82368434,Kylie,We had a lovely stay here. The weather held for us so we got to explore the Barossa Valley. Loved our fire each night that Christa set for us. More than enough provisions for breakfast. Felt at home. Lovely and private. Highly recommend and would definitely come back. 
8153197,103622667,2016-09-23,6248547,Amanda,"Naimanya cottage was a gorgeous country homestay and set the scene for the perfect experience in the Barossa. Christa was a wonderful host, filling the kitchen with delicious local produce for breakfast and everything we could ask for. The cottage was very spacious and cosy we couldn't recommend staying here enough. "
8153197,109649625,2016-10-22,46356706,Alison,"A wonderful place for a much needed rest and quiet getaway. Christa's attention to detail was impressive, and we (a couple with 7 month old baby) were made to feel most welcome.  Amazing how restorative a couple of nights in front of the fire with a glass of wine can be!"
8153197,115766150,2016-11-26,72409954,Wendy,"Thank you Christa for a very relaxing stay in your beautiful cottage.Views soothing.Abundance of goodies in the fridge and on the table,couldn't fault a thing.I was reluctant to light the fire as it was set so attractively but couldn't resist.Forget to tell you how lovely your flowers arrangement was."
8153197,124079169,2017-01-01,9974434,Amelia,"My husband and I had a perfect 5 days in the Barossa staying on Christa's wonderful farm and vineyard. We appreciated the fresh breakfast provisions, locally sourced (some from the farm!) every morning. Thank you Christa for sharing your home with us. Close to everything yet isolated with a lovely view over the Riesling grapevines."
8153197,133991191,2017-02-25,88644249,Louise,"The perfect place to stay to dip your toe into the Barossa. The place is quiet and feels secluded, and Christa's food supplies help to whet your appetite! We had a lovely weekend - thanks again for your hospitality."
8153197,138467871,2017-03-19,54807865,Hui Lan,"We love Christa's property. It is close to The Barossa but away from the main town. The property is full of character. We love the fresh eggs and tomatoes that Christa provides from her farm for brekkie. Rusty, her pet dog, is extremely friendly. Everyone make us feel very comfortable and welcomes us warmly."
8153197,145348629,2017-04-17,110232644,Katie,"You won't be disappointed when you stay at Christa's b and b. Christa is a wonderful host, provides fresh goods for breakfast which many are replaced daily. The eggs are from her own hens . The views are to die for and there is so much wildlife! The shower is easy to access as you don't have to climb into it and the toilet is sort of separate around the corner in the bathroom! So someone can use the toilet while someone else uses the shower which is a great system. There is a national park about a 10 min walk when you turn right out the property which has LOTS OF KANGAROOS hoping around, eating, but make sure u go an hour before sunset to see them. The property is in easy reach of every where in the barossa and sepplesfield has a beautiful drive down to it with gorgeous trees. Highly recommended this place "
8153197,149194567,2017-05-03,124203095,Erin,"The house was perfect!  It was clean and the area was quiet and relaxing.  Christa provided all of the makings for breakfast every morning.  We had a very enjoyable stay and would highly recommend it.  We didn't have a car so taxi fares into town were quite expensive so our only recommendation is if you are staying here, have use of a car.  Great value for money!"
8153197,159905310,2017-06-12,60577275,Nick,"Thank you for having us Christa, Erin and I had a lovely break staying at Naimanya. The breakfast was delicious, and having the fire made each day was a nice touch. 

There is plenty of room and bedding, so its good to know we will be able to bring the kids next time!

We loo forward to coming back for another stay sometime soon! :)"
8153197,168110713,2017-07-09,55089013,Alice,"Christa was an amazing host. Stayed up really late when our flight was delayed so she could let us in and give us a tour of the house. Provided a wonderful fresh breakfast each morning and cleaned the place during the day when we were out. The house is a beautiful old cottage, with a great fire place and heating in each room. Christa even cooked us some beautiful apple slice on arrival, and left a gorgeous bottle of shiraz for us to enjoy with dinner.

Would recommend staying here to anyone wanting a quiet stay, close to wineries. We will definitely be staying again.

"
8153197,205298746,2017-10-21,27986773,Amy,Christas place was exactly what we were after. I would definitely stay here again and the small thoughtful touches were great. We were left with supplies for breakfast by either grown on the farm or local produce. We felt at home and loved being on a farm away from Tunanda and Angustown. Both towns were not far and definitely worth exploring. Gorgeous area and a great location in the Barossa. We only stayed 2 nights but I recommend 3-4 nights.
8153197,210982204,2017-11-12,27079629,Colleen,"Christa's place was in a fantastic location, out of the main towns but still only a 10 minute drive away. Christa's knowledge of the area certainly came in handy when planning our day and the Rolf Binder Riesling that was left for us in the fridge was delicious.

And what can we say about breakfast. It was so good! Eggs from her farm, delicious bacon, homemade jams and breads. She certainly went above and beyond to ensure we had an amazing stay. Thanks again Christa!"
8153197,218083608,2017-12-11,42948187,Meryl,"The Naimanya cottage is absolutely stunning. It has impeccable views with a cosy cottage interior. The location is perfect as it offers a quiet country stay whilst only being 10mins away from main areas. 

Christa is a wonderful and generous host. The best Air BnB host we've ever had! Definitely a place worth requesting!"
8153197,220803052,2017-12-24,62125476,Martha,"We loved staying at Christa’s! From the beautiful cottage, amazing views, and thoughtful touches, you will Not be disappointed with this delightful place!"
8153197,224943288,2018-01-04,161673070,Jamie,"Really nice place to stay while exploring the Barossa. Quite close to all the wineries but you still feel like your secluded. House has everything you need with some lovely thoughtful touches. Host is friendly and helpful. Annie the dog is a legend,"

Phoebe & Lachie "
8153197,233754416,2018-02-11,164732205,Correnna,"Christas place is a hidden piece of old fashion paradise. Great hospitality, local produce left daily, great host, a beautiful kelpie, annie, and all the time in the world. I loved that we could do so much, or so little, it was very relaxing in an authentically old world atmostphere. Thankyou christa"
8153197,235772946,2018-02-17,2096660,Janet,"This is a wonderful country retreat, with exceptionally warm country hospitality. Christa was a wonderful host and we will definitely be returning, again and again."
8153197,243991982,2018-03-17,14505174,Megan,"We absolutely loved staying at Christa's! We were with another couple for the weekend, visiting the Barossa Valley - and could not have picked a more picture perfect place to stay. 

Her house is clean, historic and beautiful. It overlooks a the rolling hills of the Barossa and Eden Valley. Christa herself is a winemaker - so some of the grapes on her property are used in wines you may have the opportunity to try! 

She was extremely helpful and responsive on check-in, and even though we were visiting in the middle of Vintage (busy season) she still made time to give us a tour of her family winery.

Keep in mind - the house is up on a big hill (hence the awesome views) so if you're doing a tour you'll be about a 10-15 min drive to a lot of the wineries near Tanunda. 

We loved Christa's place and would definitely stay there again the next time we visit the Barossa! 

**she also has the cutest Kelpie puppy called Annie!"
8153197,251383053,2018-04-08,9495305,Leigh,"Christa was an amazing host - plenty of thoughtful touches and genuine consideration about our stay and experience. 

The cottage is historic, and could do with some small touches to make more user-friendly e.g. larger sofa in lounge room, comfy chairs on the deck for afternoon vino. 

All in all we felt very looked after and loved our time in the Barossa. Thanks Christa!"
8153197,262459249,2018-05-09,63325540,Ruth,"A quiet, rural outlook, which is very peaceful.  I would recommend it to all.  Christa was a great host."
8153197,263791670,2018-05-13,29820705,Ben,Cozy and very charming place among beautiful scenery. Great place to stay for a weekend exploring the Barossa Valley.
8153197,266292706,2018-05-19,50176105,Otto,This was the perfect space to explore the Barossa Valley and had a beautiful view! The host was very helpful with recommendations for exploring the area and supplied us with yummy farm foods.
8153197,268094948,2018-05-23,45319315,Elise,"Christa is a fantastic host, the cottage is a nice escape from Tanunda, located in a lovely quiet valley - fresh brekkies everyday and equipped with everything you need."
8153197,280692662,2018-06-24,72938971,Hamish,We had an incredible few days in the Barossa and very much enjoyed our stay with Christa. We were after an authentic Barossa experience and couldn’t have been more pleased with the cottage. Drinking wine by the open fire in the evenings was just what we needed after a big day touring the vineyards. By staying with Christa you not only get access to a great cottage but she is also a well renowned winemaker only too willing to share her knowledge of the region. A great experience. We’ll be back.
8153197,326687536,2018-09-23,69465389,Shane,"We can highly recommend a stay at Christa's cottage. Staying on the farm which is within easy reach of the Barossa and Eden Valley's (10 mins) , provided us with a very relaxing experience. 
Our hosts Christa and Leon were very helpful and friendly. The cottage had provisions for a full cooked breakfast with fresh farm eggs. The open fire in the lounge room also created a lovely atmosphere.  A raised veranda offers fantastic views of their vineyard and surrounding farms.
There are plenty of walking trails in the area for those who want to experience the native wild life and bush land.

It's a cozy, old cottage with a lot of character and a beautiful view over a vineyard. Christa was friendly and welcoming as was Annie, the Kelpie! The breakfast provided for us to cook was fresh and it was fully restocked each day. The location is at the top of a hill so the drive to the vineyards takes a little extra time, but we didn't mind because the views descending into the valley were beautiful. Would definitely recommend a stay here!"
8153197,336086016,2018-10-14,13939675,Oliver,"Would highly recommend. The cottage is in a beautiful location overlooking vineyards, is rustic and provides more of an authentic Barossa experience. Christa the host is extremely friendly and responsive she also provided a ton of extras which made the stay even more pleasant incl fresh ingredients for breakfast each morning, the fire made up each day and wine from the local vineyard. Would definitely stay again! Olly"
8153197,338942147,2018-10-21,190033476,Fiona,"WOW! what an amazing cottage. Beautiful views, excellent host and the most relaxing environment. Christa is a brilliant host. Will definitely be going back for another relaxing weekend in the future."
8153197,342545908,2018-10-28,161686635,Maddie,"We enjoyed our short & sweet stay at Naimanya, the cottage was undeniably spotless, clean and well upkept. It was a cool experience to stay in a building dating back to mid 1800's! The country setting was peaceful and only a 10-20 minute driving distance of Angaston and Tanunda. We loved Annie the dog's cute little visits when we were outside. We appreciated the included breakfast provisions that were restocked everyday. The cottage was attached to the family home, and has been modernised with touches of a pump pressurised shower of rainwater, reverse cycle, wifi, and heat lamp in bathroom; which was a cool setup in itself with toilet in the same room but concealed in the corner at the same time by an original wall. The lookout off Tanunda creek road not far from residence was awesome at the time of sun-set.
"
8153197,345751336,2018-11-06,3316167,Jemi,Christa's bed and breakfast was fantastic. Many nice touches throughout our stay and an amazing location to base ourselves. We also managed to taste some of Christa's wine and were fascinated by her story. Thanks for a beautiful stay!
8153197,400683388,2019-01-12,24684920,Daen,"We really loved our stay here! Christa was a great host and was very accomodating. We especially loved the home grown eggs, bacon, fresh juice and milk in the fridge on arrival."
8153197,430592825,2019-03-31,5200343,Lou,"We had a wonderful weekend in Christa’s cottage, thoroughly enjoying ourselves. It’s such a gorgeous place and Christa is a wonderful host. We especially loved her tour at their winery. We just loved the fabulous brekkie provisions, the wine and the thoughtful touches with sage and figs from the garden when we said we were cooking that night. Thanks again. Lou xx"
8616078,55790026,2015-12-06,9413361,Keith,What a great house. The location is delightful. It is at the end of a laneway with views across the countryside from all rooms. It was very clean and well equipped. The welcome gifts were greatly appreciated. A cool oasis on a hot day.
8616078,59367611,2016-01-10,46814159,Mickael,"Creeve Roe was one of my best experience in SA. Robyn, the owner, is very attentive to details. Getting to the place was easy with GPS even though it was in the bush. Everything was set for our arrival with a little welcome note, flowers and a delicious breakkie with homemade bread. And most importantly, the house was simply amazing, like in a dream. On the top of that everything was eco-friendly. Location was perfect, 20 min to Tanunda and plenty of wineries to visit. Actually one of them 5 min walking... Very convenient!
And all of that on a beautiful hilly scenery.
Definitely a place not to be missed!"
8616078,71492542,2016-04-25,62071800,Stephanie,"I cannot speak more highly enough of Robyn and the Creeve Roe property. Firstly, Robyn went completely out to ensure that the property had everything we needed to feel like we were on a holiday. This included a lovely breakfast assortment (i.e fresh made bread, cake, croissants and fruit etc), games to play, and an av system to play our music through. Not only that but Robyn communicated very well with us to ensure that we would find the property easily. She then also took the time to ensure that we had settled in properly. 
There were 6 of us staying at the Property and we were after a property that had enough bedrooms and bathrooms but also ample space for us to ""chill out"" and relax. This property ticked all the boxes - we couldn't have been more happy with our selection in accommodation for our Barossa trip. It was also not far at all from the wineries. Highly recommend for a group trip!
"
8616078,72204354,2016-05-01,7144904,Angela,"Robyn is amazing! Her space is wonderful, just as lovely and picturesque and remote as advertised. It's such a cool escape -- we felt very off-the-grid here and loved seeing the kangaroo momma and baby hanging around outside the house a few times. Robyn is also one of the best hosts on AirBnb -- communication was stellar, and she made us feel so welcome with fresh fruit and homemade bread and treats! Her house is fully stocked with everything you could possibly need, and it was just top-to-bottom a perfect experience. We wanted for nothing -- except perhaps a few more days in her wonderful home. :) if we're ever back in the Barossa, absolutely we will stay here if we can. Superb. Thank you so much, Robyn!"
8616078,78064379,2016-06-05,25372509,Linda,"What a beautiful home in an idyllic setting! Robyn was easily contactable and very accomodating with small changes in check in and check out times. Everything we needed was in the house including a beautiful carrot cake. There was heaps of room for 3 couples. The views from every room was to die for. It was lovely to lie in bed and watch the sun rise casting lovely lighting over the hills and dales. 
We walked around some of the property down to the river and old ruins of a house and barns, scaring some of the kangaroos as we went. It was very hard to leave this place and we all said we should have booked for a week. 
Of course the wineries and breweries were all very close with some wonderful tastings. "
8616078,81084976,2016-06-20,36134359,Alicja,"Such a lovely house with amazing views, the photos don't do it justice. 
Some gorgeous little personal touches like home made bread and cake were very much appreciated! Would definitely stay here again. "
8616078,86294560,2016-07-15,59453365,Kerry,"I was travelling with 3 others to spend a week in the Barossa. We wanted somewhere peaceful, rural, and central for exploring the Valley. We got it with Creeve Roe. We were welcomed warmly with the kitchen set up with tasty staples, home made bread and a delicious cake. The house was very clean and well appointed with eveything you could want. And the view! Oh my goodness, amazing! Enjoyed it the whole week. And Robyn was very helpful with any requests. It was a perfect spot from which to do our touring. Highly recommend it."
8616078,87183494,2016-07-18,63199573,Megan,"As soon as we walked into Creeve Roe, we were impressed with the beautiful views of the surrounding countryside. The spaciousness of the living/kitchen area was perfect and the house was beautifully presented. The privacy of the accommodation just added to the experience and waking up to see some local kangaroos just added to the adventure, especially for the kids. Whilst Robyn was unable to personally meet us on arrival, we found the property easily with her detailed directions and we were greeted with a lovely cake plus breakfast provisions together with tea/coffee and pantry staples. Overall truly wonderful accommodation, thankyou Robyn."
8616078,88459857,2016-07-24,35670496,Andrew,Our host made us feel very pampered with her special breakfast provisions and homemade cake. We stayed with 2 other couples and we all agreed the accommodation was comfortable and well appointed and had lovely sweeping views of rolling pastures  from the living area and bedrooms. Well located to all the attractions of the Barossa and excellent value for money. Hope to return again. 
8616078,123611602,2016-12-30,18686498,Aaron,The family stayed over Christmas and we were pleasantly surprised from before we arrived. Robyn's communication about getting to the property and helpful hints combined with the little touches on arrival helped to make the trip one of our best. The house has plenty of little treasures to keep you occupied and beautiful views. Strongly recommended for families who need just enough space to stay out of each others hair :P
8616078,125502725,2017-01-06,38214922,Alex,Lovely place - private and tranquil - we had a very relaxing stay. Robyn was a great host. 
8616078,137015713,2017-03-12,44228967,Sharon,"We were 3 couples who had a wonderful stay. Very clean, comfortable and extremely quiet. Robyn quickly helped us with any question we had. Thank you."
8616078,146830030,2017-04-23,35287825,Jenna,"House is in a great location if you want a nice escape in the middle of the Barossa country. It is a nice large property on a large block and has everything you would want, including a nice fire place. It was lovely view to wake up to in the morning and Robyn was a great host. She had left us breakfast and a cake which was a nice personal touch to add! We would definitely stay here again when visiting the Barossa."
8616078,158474962,2017-06-07,24127754,Christian,"Picturesque does not even come close. We arrived after nightfall for a few days in Barossa with our newborn and my in laws. Robyn's instructions were good and (Hidden by Airbnb) maps found the place just fine. We enjoyed some cake that was kindly provided and warmed ourselves by the fire and in the morning we were treated to the fantastic views over the rolling countryside.
There was lots of space for us and we enjoyed the bread a croissants provided for breakfast.
The beds are comfy and the house is well stocked with most the things you will need.
While the house feels private and remote its just a 20 minute drive to most vineyards and attractions. Well worth it if you feel like a complete getaway. Would love to return again."
8616078,165108232,2017-06-30,100138697,Jocelyn,Perfect location to feel secluded but within driving distance to the rest of the Barossa valley. It was a fantastic experience in the Barossa valley!
8616078,179172739,2017-08-07,17163104,Chenelle,"Creeve Roe is a about a 10-15 minute drive from the main town, so it's well-located, but also far enough such that the views are really quite amazing (vast expanse of land/hills/vineyards, etc). House is quite spacious and well equipped -- everything you need and the kitchen (plus a welcome cake and food for breakfast!). 

Robyn was also extremely helpful throughout the process -- check-in was a breeze, and she made sure we had what we needed over the weekend (how to use the fireplace, what to do in case a storm came through and killed the power -- didn't happen thankfully!). Lovely home base for exploring the Barossa! :)"
8616078,207280214,2017-10-29,6651680,Elayne,"Really lovely place that was spacious, scenic and relaxing. Loved the extra touches of cake and homemade loaf."
8616078,208069836,2017-10-30,68357780,Linda,"It's hard to describe how beautiful this home is and how accommodating Robyn is!!   The setting is beautiful, the location is fantastic, and Robyn has thought of everything you could possibly need to make your stay pleasant.  She even provided breakfast for the first morning of our stay!!  This has been our best experience at an Airbnb!!"
8616078,210970509,2017-11-12,23276754,Sandra,"We had a wonderful stay, perfect location, amazing views and everything we needed. Thoughtful touches with the cake, fresh loaf of bread and breakfast provisions. The house itself is well designed, beautiful large living/kitchen area with amazing floor to ceiling windows so you can take in the views of the rolling hills and countryside around. Lovely spot to sit outside while the sun sets. Bedrooms very comfortable and spacious. Bathrooms excellent and there is really everything you need for a great stay; games, cards, binoculars, coffee, tea, condiments etc. Robyn's communication for directions was clear and she was very quick to respond to any emails. Needless to say, we were very impressed and had a wonderful weekend. We will certainly be highly recommending Creeve Roe to all our family and friends."
8616078,212689548,2017-11-19,20824616,Paul,"A beautifully peaceful and scenic getaway that is very convenient to all that the Barossa has to offer. 

We will be back."
8616078,216012495,2017-12-02,33803031,Meg,"Excellent communication, amazing views, comfortable & clean. Highly recommended holiday house!"
8616078,262152136,2018-05-08,6689298,Ros,"Creeve Roe was perfectly located for our 5 night stay in the beautiful Barossa. Our host, Robyn, ensured we arrived to a warm and comfortable home: a lit fire, freshly baked bread and a welcoming cake. It was so lovely to come “home” after a day of exploring. Highly recommended."
8616078,266330941,2018-05-20,185431369,Alyson,"I have just returned from a girls weekend, and the house and property are amazing, photos just don't do it justice. Robyn was a wonderful host with homemade bread and a cake waiting on arrival. She was easy to communicate with leading up to our stay and with her detailed information about the house and the local area. I would recommend to definitely stay here again, and if we are ever needing a place to stay we will definitely be returning!"
8616078,274726616,2018-06-10,98704100,John,Amazing place to stay with lots of wild life serenity definitely a must family friendly!
8616078,280699394,2018-06-24,86823524,Mike,We had a wonderful three days at Creeve Roe. The home is brilliantly situated with views over the Barossa and it was a delight to wake each morning to Kangaroos on the hill side.
8616078,292793641,2018-07-19,173162827,Susan,"Creeve Roe is a fantastic base from which to explore the beautiful Barossa Valley and surrounds. The house has everything provided and has a lovely outlook over farmland, Robyn was also extremely helpful with all aspects of the trip. I would definitely recommend Creeve Roe to friends and family. "
8616078,303229358,2018-08-07,133056562,Penny,"The most fabulous home. We booked because we wanted to explore the Barossa but rather wished that we hadn’t planned any exploring just so we could thoroughly enjoy this lovely home. Stunning views, a most amazing bath tub, great kitchen and living areas, very comfortable queen sized beds, plenty of room, great hot water and a lovely fire. 
Robyn is a great host. Check in was easy, Robyn is very approachable and communication was straight forward. We had a tiny issue that was solved immediately. The pictures do not do the home justice! The bath is divine and the views are amazing. Don’t book anywhere else! We aim to return and as soon as we can."
8616078,316727550,2018-09-01,57871834,Grant,We absolutely loved our stay in this tranquil and idyllic space. Look forward to coming back!!
8616078,335330987,2018-10-12,5040661,Sylvia,"Robyn’s house is paradise in the countryside. It is situated beautifully on the top of the hill and the views are breathtaking. The house is very cute and very cosy with a beautiful bathtub. The kitchen is extremely good equipped and Robyn provides so many delicious food extras such as a really tasty cake, croissants, cheese and so much more. We loved the house and we will tell all our friends about it. It is beautiful and peaceful and so cosy."
8616078,341043266,2018-10-26,37433368,Sally,Great place to stay if you want a peaceful country retreat in the Barossa. Great hospitality and well situated for exploring the region.
8616078,347168411,2018-11-11,96720035,Ashleigh,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Robyn's place! The views were incredible and Robyn was incredibly accommodating! Would definitely recommend a stay here!
8616078,352169522,2018-11-24,96320299,Paula,"Amazing home with beautiful views.  We are now calling this the ""Kangaroo House"" since we spent each morning watching the family of kangaroos have breakfast.  We loved our time here."
8616078,354449803,2018-12-01,4639245,John & Julie,"Julie and I would  without hesitation recommend Robyn's fantastic property for those heading to the Barossa Valley.  Less than a ten minute drive to the 'centre of the Barrossa' is the charming township of Tanunda with vineyards surrounding - everything is so close and convenient.

We were amazed with the house, its stunning views, spacious layout and amenities, just as described on the listing...and much much more.  Thanks also for not only for your responsiveness to our changing needs but also for leaving us with that most generous and amazing 'welcome hamper'; we all enjoyed the fresh local offerings provided. 

We have nothing but the highest praise for this property, its location and value for money and most importantly with Robyn our host and unreservedly recommend the property to  anyone seeking great accommodation in the Barossa Valley."
8616078,357308741,2018-12-10,55072095,Beth,"A few minutes drive from the Tanunda town, yet this place was incredibly secluded. We never heard a single car while we were there. Just us and the kangaroos enjoying the beautiful valley and amazing sunsets.
The house was immaculately clean, comfortable and well appointed. Breakfast plus some tasty treats were provided and there were all the bits and pieces you need to cook (a bit of olive oil, butter, foil, kitchen roll etc).
Robyn was responsive and clear with the comms. I hope we get a chance to get back to the Barossa, in which case we will try to stay here again for sure."
8616078,360814288,2018-12-21,189264553,Lyndon,"Robyn is a fantastic host who will make you feel at home during your stay. With stunning views from all rooms in the house, and the closest of the Barossa Valley's myriad cellar doors at the end of the road, this is the perfect location to base yourself for your wine adventure."
8616078,365038820,2019-01-01,230447868,Kristy,"Beautiful views, fabulous location!!"

Robyn is a particularly fabulous host and makes the experience even more enjoyable with her extra special finishing touches. Once again, we’ll be back!"
8616078,402252465,2019-01-17,22698027,Brendan,Beautiful house in a beutiful location. We really enjoyed our stay.
8616078,415927954,2019-02-23,213504880,Steve,"Don’t even bother looking to stay anywhere else. 
Amazing view, lovely home, all the little bits and pieces you want at home are there for you. Wineries close by.
We just hopped around at our own pace in taxis. Wish we had an extra day to relax at the accommodation.
I’m sure you could find a place closer to town but out amongst the rolling valleys and vineyards was what we were after.
Great spot"
8616078,422753393,2019-03-11,147979051,Michela,We absolutely loved our stay at Creeve Roe. The views are incredible while the house itself has everything you could need or want & Robyn's special touches make you feel very welcome. Highly recommend a stay here!
8616078,424480143,2019-03-16,56416801,Sarah,This place is amazing - from the small touches like a home made cake and bread to the wonderful breakfast hamper to the most amazing view - we have never stayed in a nicer place - thank you Robyn - we had the most amazing time! Easy pick up for full day wine tours and we watched the sunset and sunrise and the kangaroos jumping past - what an experience!
8616078,427535957,2019-03-24,49686217,Maggie,Creeve Roe has a fabulous view and the house is designed to make the most of it. It's easy to get to the wineries and other attractions of the Barossa. Robyn is a great host and left us a fabulous welcome platter which was a lovely surprise. Highly recommend it!
8616078,430572468,2019-03-31,201255161,Shannon,The view is amazing and the house has ample room for a family.  You will need a car to get around. About a 15 min drive to the nearest town (which is lovely).
8616078,435596568,2019-04-11,174064621,Allan,"Robyn’s place is very comfortable with a great view, extremely private and a well stocked kitchen. We enjoyed our three night stay thoroughly."

8616563,121173432,2016-12-14,23035964,Jan,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8616563,126049786,2017-01-08,52987608,Mark,"Kym and Steve are amazing hosts. We required an on-the-spot booking, and were more than happy to accommodate. Instant responses whenever we had questions which was a very big help.

As the description states, the beautiful home keeps its Circa 1890s feel with its layout and decor, with the added bonus of a modern kitchen and spa facilities.

The short walk to the main street was also very convenient.

Perfect for travelling families."
8616563,136018371,2017-03-07,108742998,Trina,"Kym's place felt like home. It was centrally located but in a quiet location. It had everything we needed. It was clean, described perfectly and was beautifully decorated. We loved it. "
8616563,168679968,2017-07-10,4200939,Krystal,"This place is amazing - everything you could possibly need & more! 
We thouroughly enjoyed our stay and can't recommend it enough, so homely and comfortable. Close to the main street (Murray Street) but still quiet...a great place to stay to relax & enjoy everything that the Barossa has to offer."
8616563,172430819,2017-07-21,115606146,Brigitta,"THANKS for a wonderful stay. True to its name we had fantastic night of indeed treasured memories. Will definitely be back and hope for an even longer stay next time. 
Brilliant place wonderfully presented and prepared. 5/5 stars."

8616563,198291285,2017-09-29,150085184,Matthew,"Great place, great location. Was awesome to be able to bring pets. Had to go through one bedroom to get to another, which was not made clear. Wifi wasn't set up as advertised but this was fixed on request."
8616563,204391560,2017-10-18,38197407,Melissa,"We have stayed at this house before. It’s really close to the Main Street so we were able to just wander up the road and grab breakfast or supplies from the supermarket.
There are supplies of juice, milk, tea, coffee and cookies provided, which is incredibly handy.
There have been more air conditioners added since we stayed there last which was great since we had some very warm days during our stay. 
The last time we stayed, we only had one child (14 months old), this time we had 2 children (3 & 16 months old) who like to get into everything. I don’t think we realized how much antique type furniture was in the house. It’s probably not really a toddler friendly house from that regard."
8616563,216009005,2017-12-02,3190183,Rosie,"A lovely house in a very convenient location. We didn't meet Kym as we arrived at night and were attending a wedding. However, the house is spotless, comfortable and close to shops and restaurants. There was milk, juice, tea and coffee and biscuits  available for us when we arrived.The garden is very pleasant and we enjoyed our stay there very much."
8616563,221539080,2017-12-26,159699508,Liz,Treasured memories is so cute and lovely - takes you back! Such a lovely place - will stay again if we have the chance. Thanks Kym for the thoughtfulness throughout!
8616563,285492372,2018-07-04,15498040,Cindy,"Clean and comfortable, great beds,  close to amenities,  and very quiet.  A terrific place to stay in the Barossa. "
8616563,333102358,2018-10-06,22218613,Narelle,"Everything was very clean and beds were quite comfortable. We stayed here a a base for a family wedding in the Barossa so it suited us fine, with all amenities we needed."
8616563,349594635,2018-11-17,5151170,Farhaana,"The house was in a convenient location, clean and comfy."
8616563,421609356,2019-03-10,134354337,Kathy,"A quaint old cottage, nicely fitted out with some lovely antiques.
The bed was very comfortable with crispy clean sheets, nice.
Pet friendly status is always a must for us, good secure garden, but sadly the garden itself is a bit neglected. 
Kym was very pleasant to deal with, prompt communication from booking to check out. Very helpful when we had a last minute addition to our plans. 
Thank you very much Kym."
9264671,67451484,2016-03-29,19869505,Ashley,"This place is exactly as described - basic (small studio, no TV etc) but has been recently renovated, is clean and modern. Very short walk to the town/shops. Tracey was really helpful and easily contactable when we struggled to initially find the place! She also left us handy things we needed over the weekend (milk, coffee, wine!) The studio can be a little bit noisy if the main house is booked as (I think) the studio is next to their kitchen/laundry."
9264671,68858071,2016-04-07,19500087,Charli,Barossa Seasons Studio is a great rest stop while enjoying the surrounding Barossa Valley. The room is a fair size with a comfy bed and large bathroom. The only trouble is finding the place but Tracey came to the rescue and explained how to find it - it's quite easy but just needs a house number displayed.
9264671,101908891,2016-09-15,94894707,Alison,"Tracey was a lovely host! Very responsive and helpful. The Barossa Seasons Studio was a compact living area which was clean, comfy and cosy. I would recommend to anyone to wants to visit and stay in the Barossa Valley for a couple of nights. It very close to the shops, restaurants and cafes just as decribed. Thanks a bunch Tracey!"

9500884,206327624,2017-10-25,54816374,Sarah,"We stayed here on our Barossa road trip. The house is very big and comfortably suited our group of 6. The kitchen is well stocked. The location is great, it’s very central to wineries. House is also very clean.  We were very happy with our stay :) host is very friendly and always immediately got a response to my messages."

9500884,209269565,2017-11-05,124367802,Emma,"I enjoyed a fabulous birthday weekend away with a group of girlfriends, staying at this beautiful house. The host was so helpful and went out of her way to give me tips and assist me with organisational matters. The house was comfortable, well equipped and the small touches on arrival made a big difference. The house was in a good location and we enjoyed a short walk into town as well as a short bus trip to many of the outstanding wineries in the region. 
I would highly recommend this accomodation to others wanting a relaxed and comfortable stay in the barossa!"

9500884,214917098,2017-11-26,21987375,Karla And Ben,"We loved this place! It was perfect for our Barossa trip and a lot more cost effective than staying right in the vineyards, but close enough we could easily drive around them. We were treated to a delicious cheese platter and goodies which were much appreciated. The pool was great to lounge around with a Barossa Shiraz. Highly recommend to other guests visiting the region."

The house is exceptionally clean with comfortable beds and furniture throughout.  Netflix was available and we made use of that one night.  The house is a short drive to main street Tanunda and a good base for day trips to wineries.  In short, we would definitely stay again!  Thank you!"

9500884,255853090,2018-04-21,101990332,Ann,"Such a fantastic home away from home. All the cutlery and crockery you could wish for to enjoy meals with multiple friends. 

We were in town for a bike ride so didn’t have time to enjoy the house as much as we would’ve liked to but certainly felt relaxed at the end of the day, with plenty of room for 5 friends to hang out, watch netflix and have a girls night in! Would suit large family group of easily accomodate 4 couples. Fantastic host who was very understanding when we were late given we had a long drive to get there.

Tatunda itself is a foodie paradise. Town has a lovely feel, would love to stay longer next trip!!"

We had everything we could need and there was an amazing welcome platter and all our breakfast needs. We'll be back next time we're in the Barossa."
9500884,294240251,2018-07-21,147131201,Justin,This place was amazing. From the spacious living area and slow combustion stove to the great breakfast bar big enough for the entire group to mill around.

9500884,313682757,2018-08-25,18256572,Van,"Sarah was fantastic, communicated promptly, really understanding when our gps lead us to a dead end, which delayed our arrival time.  The house looks even better then the pictures, as you cannot get the gage of how roomies it is from the pictures.  Kitchen well stock with cookware, serve ware and utensil to ensure enough of everything for up to 10 people, had nice wine glasses to cover red, white, sparkling or dessert.  The Nespresso machine with all the Nespresso pods, definitely a life saver in the morning to get us going for the day.  Would love to come back in Summer to use the pool and barbecue next time."

Bathroom and living room were excellent areas! Loved the big shower and the hot water was fabulous! Spa bath - huge! 
Lynley and her partner left us more than enough breakfast supplies for our week - which we enjoyed. 
We didn't get out in the cold weather onto their deck - but in the warmer months, it would be awesome!
Heating was more than adequate - 2 split systems heated the whole place. 
We enjoyed staying in Lyndoch as it was a more relaxed location in the Barossa. Only 20mins by car to Nuriootpa (which is a large country town) and 10 mins in car to lovely Tanunda. We jumped on to the bike path easily and had a lovely ride to many wineries and eateries. 
"
9687272,57955599,2015-12-30,51462300,Ryan,"My stay at Casa Mia was wonderful. The house was beautiful, clean, and homely. The view of the Barossa is amazing, and I had a feeling of freedom the whole time I was there. You can see how much love and attention has gone into making the house welcoming. I appreciated the little things that you thought of.

Thank you so much again. I recommend staying here to anyone looking for a little peace and privacy in the country. "
9687272,64072714,2016-02-29,31009638,Jess,We had a wonderful weekend at Casa Mia. The house is full of charm and is also very functional. The deck is perfect for meals or drinks and looks out over vineyards.  The location is very private but only a short drive to town. Our friends complimented out choice of accommodation every day we stayed at Casa Mia.
9687272,66419601,2016-03-22,38874102,Mackenzie,"Casa Mia was perfect in every way. I had family visiting from Canada and wanted to show them a true Barossa experience- this place exceeded our expectations. Beautiful setting amongst rolling vines, very peaceful and a gorgeous restored cottage. Georgina has an eye for detail, even left us produce for our first breakfast!
 I would recommend anyone stay here and I myself would love to come back! "
9687272,71236412,2016-04-24,1601694,Alwie,"Beautiful home, very spacious rooms and lovely provisions for breakfast. Very close to appelation, hentley farm, two hands, greenock etc. "
9687272,76829089,2016-05-29,32944318,Fiona,"The house is gorgeous.  Set on a lovely dirt road in amongst the vines, you feel miles from anywhere despite being just minutes to everything in the Barossa.  The beds were so comfy - we all slept so well.  And the breakfast left for us was lovely - that bacon, mmmm...  Thank you and I'm sure we'll stay again!"
9687272,81385851,2016-06-22,68001048,Emmi,"Casa Mia Barossa was the most incredible home to stay at during our time in the Barossa Valley! Georgina was so kind to leave fresh fruit and food for our arrival and the house was so clean and tidy.

What a divine home! We cannot talk highly about it enough! "

The house was beautiful and very clean.  We also found it quite spacious. The provisions for the first breakfast were excellent and made us feel at home. We had a wonderful stay. 
9687272,85459024,2016-07-11,6462959,Joanna,We had a great stay at Casa Mia.  The house was in beautiful condition and everything was clear and easy to find.  We have already recommended the house to friends and will definitely want to return on our next stay in the Barossa.  
9687272,94020535,2016-08-14,23551144,Michael And Kirsty,"Amazing place. Better then the photos suggest. House was great for 3 couples for a weekend in Barossa. Location was spectacular. There were also more facilities at the house then the listing suggests. It's really well set up. Honestly, for my trip to the Barossa, if this house isn't available, I'll be changing my dates! :) "
9687272,99472563,2016-09-05,78951249,Ryan,"Beautiful place, lovely large gas stove, away from everyone yet close enough to everything when you want it to be. 
"
9687272,101311850,2016-09-12,9542015,Victoria,"This house is perfect for any visit to Barossa! Little drive distance to main wineries and city centre (Tanuda) yet secluded on its own way to make for  an incredibly relaxing getaway. The house itself is spotless, ready to use, and I would agree with other reviews on two things - the beds are so comfy! And the house is even better than the pics show. Finally, Georgina is a message away in case you need her and very easy to communicate with."
9687272,104614973,2016-09-27,41321253,Maree,"Thank you Georgina for our wonderful stay at your home. The rooms and beds were lovely, the home spotless and the amenities you provided very welcome.

9687272,105761526,2016-10-02,2270395,Nevena,"Well, what a joy! For months we'd been looking forward to staying at the gorgeous Casa Mia Barossa, and it's safe to say that, once there, we pretty much instantly fell in love with the cottage. (Love at first sight, if you will!) Not only is it beautiful and cosy, but spacious, clean, homey, comfortable and peaceful. Also, the surrounding views? TO DIE FOR! Not only can you enjoy them from the terrace but, also, the lovely kitchen. (P.S. I need that farmhouse-style sink in my life.) We would definitely stay here again the next time we trek over to Barossa; no doubt. Stunning little abode plain and simple. A big thanks to Georgina for all her help, for the basket of goodies (brekky and other food), and for making us feel at home!"
9687272,125258133,2017-01-04,2016117,Maria,"Awesome house, fantastic views! It looks much better than on the pictures - very clean, recently repaired and fantastic antique pieces of furniture. A lot of space, big bedrooms. Georgina also left us fresh country eggs, milk, bread and fruits- that was so nice!"
9687272,126431857,2017-01-11,46518844,Sam,"What an amazing house!!! Thank you Georgina for letting us stay in your wonderful home. From the minute we arrived, we felt right at home. It was lovely and quiet which was exactly what we were after. It is a very quick drive into town and local wineries, and the local Taxi is familiar with the property so easy to get to and from places without driving! Absolutely breathtaking view, especially at sunset. Definitely recommend staying here, it's everything you could need in a home away from home! "
9687272,127267873,2017-01-16,95577595,Kirsty,Such a beautiful house overlooking the vines. 10 minutes from tanunda and surrounded by exciting wineries. Can't recommend it highly enough. Perfect with kids as very streamlined and kitchen well equipped.
9687272,138056321,2017-03-18,43761064,Ben,Couldn't be happier. Thanks Georgina!
9687272,139537674,2017-03-25,844800,Lesley,"I would highly recommend Georgina's place. It was very easy to check in, she had stocked the fridge with great breakfast starters since we arrived late and no shops were open. The beds were very comfortable, we had everything we needed and it was pure delight to sit on the balcony as the sun was setting, sipping on some local bubbly, listening to Frank Sinatra on the outdoor speakers. We also had some morning visitors of two 'roos which was a treat for our non-Aussie family! Close to lots of great Barossa wineries, we could have spent the whole weekend just zipping around that small area and there would be plenty to do and see."
9687272,147080949,2017-04-24,88565402,Gabrielle,We spent three lovely nights at this property. The views are just spectacular and nice to be a little bit out of the busy-ness of the main town Tanunda. The breakfast provisions provided were lovely too and communication with regards to check in was very quick and easy - Georgina was very accommodating. We hope to be back again in the future! 
9687272,149975004,2017-05-06,37854586,Catherine,"What a beautiful spot, and a wonderful welcoming place to stay. Hightlights include having a warm cuppa on the deck on our first morning, as the sun slowly illuminated the sky. Rows of autumnal grape vines, as far as we could see. Peaceful, secluded, quiet, and effortlessly elegant. I cannot recommend strongly enough."
9687272,153848705,2017-05-22,76786786,Charles,Lovely outlook over vines. Beautiful place and great location.
9687272,175044099,2017-07-28,34329604,Rob,"We had an amazing time staying here. The host was very helpful getting us in on extremely short notice (within 1 hour of making contact!)
The property has character and with its elevated position has great views of the surrounding vineyards. Very close to some amazing wineries/restaurants but we also enjoyed cooking up some meals and sitting out on the deck to soak it all in. Will def come back."
9687272,182964528,2017-08-16,134973817,Scott,"Lovely house, you wouldn't know that you were less than 5 min from the centre of Tanunda."

9687272,221820729,2017-12-27,6594230,Sarah,"This has got to be one of the best Airbnb’s available in South Australia. It’s situated on a vineyard, so the scenery is unreal. It’s beautiful to sit on the deck, wine in hand and relax.

It's in an awesome location, especially close to Tanunda, but also easy distance to Nurioopta and other places.

9687272,422389581,2019-03-11,87445320,Felicity,"Casa Mia was beautifully presented, very well located and made our weekend stay in the Barossa wonderful. The deck was a great place to relax with a wine at the end of the day overlooking neighbouring vineyards. The house was spotless and inviting, I would definitely stay here again."
9687272,424508596,2019-03-17,32027087,Julie,"Georgina's cottage is perfectly located to enjoy the Barossa Valley. 
Located in a rise, overlooking vines and the stunning scenery of the valley. 
The house is well set up with 3 large bedrooms, a large kitchen and separate lounge. The bathroom and kitchen are modern with all amenities one would want. Breakfast provisions are fresh and tasty. 
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone travelling to Barossa Valley. Thank you Georgina for a wonderful stay :-)"
9714178,71470894,2016-04-25,24458055,Laura,"Our stay in the Barossa Valley was fantastic, largely due to the phenomenal accommodation in Tanunda. The pictures honestly do not do this home justice. Not only does the decor look like you stepped into a page of Architectural Digest, Yvette is the master of ensuring her guests have every amenity someone could need when away from home with friends (a full kitchen with a nespresso, iron, hairdryers, umbrellas, playing cards, DVD player...the list goes on). The home was more than comfortable for four people (it could easily fit 6); the large outdoor area adds to the immense space already offered. To top it off, the home is less than a 5 min walk into town (3 min to the grocery store) & all of the vineyards we visited were no more than a 15 min drive from the house. Yvette was also incredibly kind and responsive with any questions I had. If I visit the Barossa region again, I will most definitely make a point to rent this home again!"
9714178,87012033,2016-07-18,29426940,Michelle (Jisue),We stayed at Yvette's place in Tanunda for 3 days and 2 nights for a friends 30th birthday weekend getaway with 6 friends. Yvette's place is absolutely beautiful. Everyone was blown away by how nice the place was when we arrived. Every single corner of the house was amazingly clean and all the appliance and furniture - pretty much the whole house was luxury. Thanks to Yvette we were able to have a delicious breakfast 2 mornings in a row. The fridges and cupboards were stocked with food! The complimentary wine and appetisers were amazing as well. Thank you Yvette for the beautiful house. We all had an amazing time! We will definitely be returning to this place when we come back to Barossa Valley!!
9714178,104821436,2016-09-28,29965545,Jeff,Great cottage 
9714178,106949228,2016-10-08,2004690,Stacey,"This accommodation definitely exceeded our expectations and made our stay over our wedding day absolutely amazing!
It was like a home away from home - a high end home at that! Everything was thought of and the produce supplied upon arrival was fantastic. 
Yvette was very effective to communicate with and we had no issues with checking in or out. We just wished we had stayed longer!
The location is perfect and close to everything on the main street and the house itself is immaculate - very modern and well finished renovations. Thank you so much for a very memorable stay!"
9714178,110017740,2016-10-23,23830566,Marietta,"Sometimes photos don't sell the story well enough, the photos couldnt show you just how fantasticly comfortable this place was. Spotlessly clean, best spot next to a couple of good restaurants, everything you need in the kitchen, including espresso machine.
Highly recommend this to anyone, nothing disappointed."
9714178,125259867,2017-01-04,1678638,Jennifer,"Yvette's place is wonderful! The property is beautiful, new and perfectly maintained. There's great outdoor space for lounging and eating with friends. There were so many thoughtful touches - like the sound system, the breakfast food that was included, the espresso machine, etc. The house is completely fitted out and a pleasure to stay in. The key code access makes check in really easy as well. This is definitely the best Airbnb in Tanunda."
9714178,185143947,2017-08-21,24174632,Kellie,"This place is absolutely stunning!  
3 bedroom, 2 bathroom stunning cottage just out of the centre of Tanunda.
The house itself is very clean, really well provisioned with breakfast and on arrival we were greeted with some wine and cheese!  There is a coffee maker there with George Clooney style Nespresso Pods in generous portions - which is great as we did struggle to find a good coffee in town!  Everything we looked for was there, from a cheese board, to wine glasses, a cooler bag and a cold pack in the freezer for a sore head!! Hehe.
The bathrooms were also well provisioned with excellent, very strong, professional standard hair dryers, exfoliating mitts, and bath salts amongst all the other standard things.  In the laundry there was laundry powder and basic cleaning equipment if needed, as well as a washer/dryer.
The styling in the house and out on the patio is exceptional, so if you are into design, this is the place to go!  We walked away with some lovely styling ideas for our own homes.
To get everywhere:
3 minute walk to a cafe.
5 minute walk to Ferment Asian (You MUST go there for a Chef's menu meal)
3 minute walk to centre of town.
Walking and riding distance to many many wineries.  This location is great for 3 couples or a family."
9714178,189495930,2017-09-02,114459613,Luke,"What an amazing place. It felt like stepping into a Home Beautiful magazine shoot! Absolutely everything was PERFECT. Yvette was an incredibly responsive, attentive and accommodating host from the moment we booked. The place itself was immaculately presented and spotlessly clean. The attention to detail in the way the place has been furnished and appointed is beyond impressive. From the instructions on the light switches to the labelled Tupperware I really cannot think of one thing they could do to improve on the place. The eggs, bacon, bread, wine, olives, dried fruits etc left for us were also as good as you could possibly get. Literally everything about this place was perfect. I could not recommend staying here more highly. We hope to be back as soon as possible!"
9714178,224667208,2018-01-03,8053791,Ana,This home is very special. Best location and so stylish. No expense has been spared in fitting out this home. We loved everything about it. wish we could have stayed longer!

9714178,268744190,2018-05-26,35171808,Glenn,"We stayed for a week in Yvette’s B&B in Tanunda.  We loved every minute of our stay.  The house is perfectly situated in Tanunda to allow ourselves and our friends to walk to all of the towns attractions, returning to warmth and comfort of the B&B when required.  We could not fault the house, the decor or the amenities provided.  We had three couples staying for the week and found there was plenty of room for all to stretch out and relax.  Highly complimented by our guests and highly recommended by us.  A great location to base yourselves for visit to the Barossa. "
9714178,277234860,2018-06-16,39328864,Alex,"Couldn’t rate Yvette and her house more highly. She was very responsive with questions in the lead up, the place was gorgeous, so many lovely touches, delicious breakfast, and perfect for our one year old too - portacots, high chair, and even bath toys at the ready! The location was the perfect distance to the centre of town and also very central to all the wineries and other towns in the Barossa. We had terrible weather all week yet still had a wonderful holiday as we enjoyed our time in the  house so much, on the comfy leather couch in front of the fire! If you go to the Barossa, you should definitely stay here!"
9714178,284664692,2018-07-02,23641510,Melinda,Lovely home. Stylishly decorated. Lots of lovely little extras. 
9714178,294299933,2018-07-22,36677441,Karyn,"Beautiful interiors and everything to make our stay great. FULLY equipped kitchen, nice toiletries, music and Netflix. The beds were warm and comfortable. I could not suggest anything to improve it. The place is truly superb. "
9714178,299881152,2018-08-01,150521152,Susie,"A stylishly presented, thoughtfully stocked and well appointed house a very short stroll into Tanunda which was perfect for dinner. We spent a week here and everything we could possibly want or need was provided. A great base for exploring The Barossa."
9714178,317239831,2018-09-02,14531271,Victoria,"From the moment you enter this property you are met with beautiful and luxurious design and thoughtful hospitality, which makes you feel instantly relaxed and ready to enjoy your time away. The amenities are of extremely high quality with everything being thought about from heated lamps and towel rails in the bathrooms, zoned air conditioning and heating, key pad easy entry on arrival and iPad for music. Quality touches include bathrobes, slippers, hair styling products and toiletries. Yvette has thought about and provided everything that makes this a 5 star property.  You also can't get a better location to discover and explore the Barossa. Thank you Yvette for providing such a beautiful weekend - we would love to come back and will highly recommend your property to our friends."
9714178,320020542,2018-09-08,26126689,Liz,"I have just returned home from a wonderful stay at Tanunda. Yvette's airbnb is gorgeous. Not only is the house divine, but Yvette has stocked the house with everything that you could possibly need. There were lots of little touches here and there throughout the house that made our stay extra special. I can not recommend this gorgeous property more highly. Thanks for a wonderful stay."

We very much enjoyed Yvette’s caring attitude, hospitality, responsiveness and special touches in the house with items in the fridge and a lovely bottle of wine. The place was lovely - very clean and very convenient. Would love to come back and would highly recommend to others."
9714178,365946257,2019-01-02,61965321,Dean,The only place to stay in Tanunda! Perfect location and a beautiful home.
9714178,409804157,2019-02-08,17903140,Michael,Excellent high quality accommodation very generously fitted out. Very comfortable beds and sofa plus ample equipment for short or long stays. The ducted air-conditioning throughout was a real boon in some extremely warm weather. The only reai negative is whilst it is situated within walking distance of shops and restaurants it fronts on to a busy main road that light sleepers may find traffic noise can be intrusive.
9798169,105610787,2016-10-02,20541831,Sean,The host canceled this reservation 23 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9798169,206998155,2017-10-28,99840590,Maree,"Walnut Cottage is well worth the visit. The first thing you will notice is the gorgeous cottage garden, so full of colour.  Sue provided everything needed to make our stay very comfy, even homemade slice awaiting us in the kitchen. The bed was comfy, great shower and we made the most of the log fire too. The location is ideal. It was an easy walk to restaurants and bars in the main street and only a short drive to visit other parts of the Barossa.  We want to tell everyone they must plan a visit to Walnut Cottage. You won't be disappointed!"
9891816,76976417,2016-05-30,72827506,Sue,"From the moment we walked in the door, we felt welcome in Vicki's house - a friendly greeting, lovely surrounds and a comfortable, private space.  Nothing was too much trouble - from booking a table at the local tavern for a bite to eat to ensuring that we were warm and had everything we needed for our run in the morning.  Couldn't have asked for a better first Airbnb experience for both of us. Highly recommended.
"
9891816,83782626,2016-07-04,8629457,Warren,Vicki and her partner were amazing hosts! I hope the next time we head to the Barossa we can see them more as friends than simply airbnb guests.  I would recommend anyone who would like a place to stay in the Barossa to consider them:)  The rooms were comfortable and as described.
9891816,88998447,2016-07-26,85275536,Tom,Vicki and her husband John were great hosts and the house was everything you want for a weekend in the Barossa. Would definitely recommend this place.
9891816,95745050,2016-08-20,4073653,Stephanie,"Our hosts were very welcoming and it was a pleasant surprise to be able to spread between two rooms, both with a lovely view down the hill to the picturesque town of Greenock."
9891816,102318248,2016-09-17,34143740,Kirby,"Vicki and John were wonderful hosts, and exceeded expectations. Beautiful place close to all the Barossa has to offer. Would highly recommend staying at Cornucopia if you're visiting the Barossa. Thanks for looking after us!"
9891816,105397057,2016-10-01,57156848,Luci,"Amazing home in a great location. Vicki and John were wonderful hosts and made us feel completely at home. Would definitely recommend, and will be looking forward to going back the next time we are in the Barossa. Thanks so much! "
9891816,106933656,2016-10-08,46749881,Kim,Our host Vicki and her partner John were very friendly and very welcoming. The accommodation description is accurate. The bedroom and sitting room were clean and the bed very comfortable. We had a lovely cup of tea and slice with our hosts in the morning and we feel we have made valuable contacts. This was our first experience booking an airbnb and I am sure we will do so again.
9891816,109020908,2016-10-18,10978946,Dieter,We were made very welcome and enjoyed our stay very much. Having 2 rooms was very relaxing and we felt at home. John has great local knowledge and Vicki's knowledge of German would be great for international guests.  The sourdough bread was fantastic for breakfast. The king size bed was very comfortable. Would love to stay again.
9891816,111029718,2016-10-29,71399498,Hailey,"Hidden gem, lovely staying with local people with local knowledge. Full of helpful ideas for an amazing Barossa stay. Highly recommend"
9891816,113159247,2016-11-10,94428949,Yong-Lip,"Vicki and John were the most gracious hosts.  They welcomed us warmly and after showing us our accommodation, sat down with us to give us recommendations on where and what to do during our wine tasting weekend in the Barossa.  John is very knowledgeable and even shared with us the smallest ""gem"" wineries that only those in the know would be aware of.  We were looking for non-mainstream wineries and John's advice was invaluable.  They helped us with working out where we could have dinner and how to maximize our enjoyment during our short stay. Staying in Greenock would probably mean one is after the ""Barossa Wine Region"" experience and we were delighted that within a 10 minute drive of Vicki's place are probably 20 delightful wineries making this a very convenient place to stay.  Don't miss Murray Street Vineyards (10 minute walk), Ballycroft Wines (ask John - you must book), Torbreck and Two Hands - I recommend them.

As for the accommodation, it  surpassed all our expectations.  We had more room than we had expected, with our private lounge area including a TV and a breakfast table.  Vicki prepared us the most beautiful continental breakfast with gourmet bread and local honey and fresh produce.

The house (and our room) was beautifully appointed in a rustic and ""old country"" feel which is everything we had hoped for.  Vicki is an artist and it shows in the decor and wall hangings.   However, the bathroom is very modern and HUGE and the shower was lovely.  Everything was absolutely perfect!!

A must try is to drink the water right out of the taps there.  It's amazingly fresh rainwater and you can literally ""taste"" the clean water which is free of chemicals.

The neighborhood is quaint and everyone seems to hold with pride their flower gardens in the front lawns.  A stroll around Greenock is both romantic and filled with floral fragrances.  The tavern about 2 minutes walk away has an amazing selection of wines by the glass (as you would no less expect) as well as freshly brewed local beers.  The food portions are HUGE so it was nice to end our day out with a great meal and more drinks before stumbling back to the room to sleep indulgently.  What a lovely stay.  We'll definitely be back!!"
9891816,113802672,2016-11-13,21286518,John And Carol,Vicki and john are nice people and great hosts and provided us with good suggestions for hiking and wineries. They also provided us with a delicious healthy breakfast and helped make a dinner reservation at a good local pub. The rooms were comfortable and clean and it was nice to have an extra room with a sofa and table. Greenock is a lovely little place  and an excellent base for exploring the area. Highly recommend 
9891816,114638955,2016-11-19,96662037,Melinda,"We had a wonderful stay with Vicki and John, who were friendly and informative hosts. We can highly recommend their place as a base for exploring the Barossa, and Greenock as a lovely town to spend some time in. "
9891816,126694046,2017-01-13,6883584,Natalia & Ryan,We loved our stay and time with Vicki and John. They knew about all the best local spots around the Barossa Valley and pointed us to some great recommendations. We got to spend a bit of time with them on our one evening there and they were great hosts and very easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. I would highly recommend this Airbnb! 
9891816,128444361,2017-01-24,23189651,Geoff,We had a delightful stay with Vicki and John in Greenock. They are such warm and generous hosts and we were fortunate to be able to spend some time with them both. The private accommodations were spacious and consisted of very large bedroom and separate sitting/dining room. The bed very comfortable. We would highly recommend a stay here and hope to return in the future.
9891816,130130812,2017-02-04,23045865,Sofie,"We had a wonderful stay at Vicky and Johns place. They are both such lovely and interesting people, full of enthusiasm for what they are doing and their community. The bedroom is large with a comfortable bed, it's great to have the dining/ living room as well, both rooms are nicely decorated with lots of personable touches, it really make it feel like your home away from home, we loved it. Vicky spoilt us with some lite treats and we had a healthy breakfast included. We can only agree with what everybody else have written and can highly recommend a stay at their place in beautiful Greenock. Thank you for having us."

Vicki and John are accommodating and friendly people who made me feel very welcome and it was a joy to share a private section of their lovely home. Location perfectly handy to the centre of this sweet town with a cafe, tavern and store all a short walk away. Wedding at Murray Street Vineyard would easily have been walkable if I'd worn sensible shoes!! Thanks Vicki & John, see you again if I'm lucky enough to get back that way."
9891816,139914031,2017-03-26,74750421,Erin,"Had a lovely stay here. Vicki was so helpful with recommendations and also tried to organise hot air ballooning when we weren't sure if they'd leave the next day. 
The room was very comfortable and breakfast was delicious.
It's walking distance to the cute town centre and great little local micro brewery.
Vicki and John were quick to recommend places to visit and help us make plans.
Great stay :) thank you"

9891816,158674142,2017-06-08,31638739,Trevor,"Vicki is a wonderful host, communicates well & is a delight to talk with over a cup of tea. The bedroom and siting room are roomy and comfortable. Vicki was able to assist whenever we asked. John, her husband, is equally interesting as he shares Vicki's passion. The location is very near to many wineries with cellar doors (walking distance to a few and the local tavern). We had a wonderful 2 night stay."
9891816,160182491,2017-06-13,125090413,Susan,"Vicki and John are wonderful hosts! Their place is cute and cosy for our weekend getaway and centrally located to several cute wineries, all within walking distances away. Also easily accessible by car to multiple larger wineries and attractions such as Seppeltfields, Two Hands Wines, Barossa Cheese Co., and Maggie Beers Farm Shop. Vicki and John are very accomodating and welcoming when we were staying with them. They respected our privacy when we wanted it and happily chat when available. Vicki helped us with planning our itinerary, and quick with answering all our questions via email. We truly enjoyed our stay and hope to be back again sometime! "
9891816,162238748,2017-06-20,20507180,Kelley,"Vicki and her partner are friendly, welcoming and lovely hosts. We were lucky enough to spend one night out together on the Greenock town, which was a lot of fun.

The room is spacious, warm and inviting. It's great having a separate lounge space to hang out and still have the essentials (bfast, tea, tv, heating etc.)

The shared bathroom was always clean and tidy, and not a problem between 4 ppl. 

We really enjoyed our stay, and accessibility to the region. Everything is close, easy to find/navigate, and Vicki has a lovely home. Thank you for having us! See you again soon :)"
9891816,168127662,2017-07-09,42240910,Melissa,"We had a lovely stay at Cornucopia Homestay this past weekend. Every thing has been thought of by Vicki & John, even down to supplying local fruit bread and freshly ground coffee for our breakfast (it was so delicious). The space is very generous, the bed super comfortable and we loved the little lounge room, a nice spot to read the papers while looking at the early morning fog in the town. Great location too, so close to everything! They are very knowledgable in everything Barossa, and make the most delicious ferments + olive oil too! We can't wait to return! Thank you Vicki + John!"
9891816,174724158,2017-07-27,11962142,Shige,"Vicki's place is a safe, peaceful, warm heartening place. The ceramic tile on the wall saying ""Wind Fire Earth Sun..."" (in Chinese character) said well about the place.
When I return to Barossa, this is the place I will stay."

We enjoyed chatting with them and it was an adventure stay with them. Thanks vicky and especially John! He is the man!
9891816,207260003,2017-10-28,23790348,Shereen,"Vicki was a great host. We especially appreciated Vicki accommodating an extra person at a reasonable price and the fruit loaf provided as part of the breakfast was delicious! We loved the location as it was within easy walking distance of 5 excellent vineyards, a brewery, a tavern for dinner (although the food wasn’t great and we waited over an hour for it) and a cafe (although our takeaway coffees which were milky and we had to wait a while). All in all we would definitely recommend Vickis place and Grennock."

Greenock was a great home base with delicious local cellar doors/brewery and a great local cafe (El Estanco). Any praise of this wonderful visit is invariably an understatement. My partner and I could not recommend Vicki and her home highly enough. :)"
9891816,220773070,2017-12-23,39219247,Juli,"Vicky and John are a wonderful people that we are very happy to have met them. 
In the house you have your own and private space with living room separated from the bedroom, that's perfect.
I only have one word to describe it: EXCELLENT.
I hope to return to Barossa Valley, If that is, I know the place that we will stay"
9891816,222845529,2017-12-30,33081004,Nelson,"We had a wonderful stay at Vicki' s place as we explored the Barossa Valley. Just a stroll from the local pub, brewery, coffee shop and Murray St Vineyards! Vicki and John were wonderful hosts and so accommodating and the place itself was great with our own private area."
9891816,227074228,2018-01-13,165297577,Stefanos,Great place in a good location. Exactly as described.

9891816,233278940,2018-02-09,166259020,Nina,"Vicki's and John's place is perfect! And their hospitality is outstanding! Greenock is a cute little town which is very close to all the wineries. Ask John, he can give you great advice!"
9891816,234221968,2018-02-12,114745740,Alison,"Great location, good communication before and during our stay and great advice on places to visit locally."
9891816,236314384,2018-02-19,22141097,Tommy,"This was a perfect place for us. Quiet and a really comfortable bed, breakfast and the best host you can get. And walking distance to 5 (five) wine tasting places. The pub with good food and good prices 2 mins walk. Can you ask for more?"
9891816,238017353,2018-02-25,51468841,Georgia,Great location for wineries in Barossa valley. The host is very helpful & welcoming and provides a private area for you to stay.
9891816,239990468,2018-03-03,7536979,Dan,Well-located in the Barossa Valley! We had the wing of the house to ourselves with an immaculate shared bathroom. Vicki and John were lovely hosts! Great value!
9891816,241619488,2018-03-09,62224296,DeeJay,Fantastic host. Great beautiful host. Would happily stay again. A+
9891816,243706956,2018-03-17,54827565,Wulstan,"We had a good time here but the location is slightly off the beaten track which does mean you’ll need a car to travel around or spend a lot of money on taxis which are very expensive.

Vicki and John are busy people so we were mostly left to our selves. This could be a plus or a minus depending on your taste. 

The room does the job fine but is nothing special, there is no air con but there is a fan. Fine when we were there but we wouldn’t have wanted it to be any hotter. The bathroom is more modern but the room is old fashioned and quite basic. Again this may or may not be a problem for you.

One thing to note is that the bathroom is on the other side of the house past the hallway and kitchen so you’ll want to be fully clothed before making a trip(!)

There is your own breakfast room complete with home made fruit bread and local maps which is a plus. It has no running water though so you’ll need to walk to the kitchen to fill anything up.

All in all it did us fine but was more expensive than other options which I suspect would have been at least as good."
9891816,244572495,2018-03-18,36406753,Edward,"We loved our stay here. A warm and welcoming place, tucked away but near the local for dinner. :-)"

9891816,248641588,2018-04-01,92790796,Ruben,Vicki was so welcoming on our arrival. Her home is very cozy with a door that separated our room from the rest of the living area. She was very helpful prior to our arrival with setting up transportation to get to our wine tour.
9891816,249802458,2018-04-03,178188874,Sarah,"Excellent room with a cosy and private breakfast nook that was generously stocked by the host. This location is only a short walk from local cellar doors and a brewery, as well as a few restaurants, but is also a great location to explore the rest of the Barossa from. Would have loved to stay a bit longer :)"
9891816,251378658,2018-04-08,139179219,Richard,"Thank you Vicki and John for letting us stay at your home in Greenock. The room was quiet and spacious and the second living space was well stocked with tea, coffee and other goodies. Vicki and John were the perfect hosts, they checked us in early and arranged transport for us to or dinner location. We wished we were able to stay a bit longer!"
9891816,254201696,2018-04-16,29672386,Guy,Vicki & John were wonderful hosts. They were very welcoming and friendly. They have a lovely home. The bed was as comfortable and warm as my own bed. Breakfast was in our own sitting room overlooking the town. Thank you Vicki we thoroughly enjoyed our weekend visit.

9891816,287181701,2018-07-07,34161161,Jana,"Vicki and John were magnificent hosts, they were generous with their time and knowledge. The space was very well fit out and comfortable and we found Greenock a good base for our Barossa Adventures. The pub was great and we really enjoyed our tasting a quick walk down the road at Schluter Wines on Saturday evening. Make sure if you’re there on a Saturday morning you head to the Farmers markets and try John’s oil and Vicki’s  ferments. Yum!"
9891816,289685120,2018-07-13,106261105,Hannah-Elaine,"This has been our favourite place to stay in the Barossa! Vicki and John are lovely hosts, the property is super clean and beautiful!

9891816,325478897,2018-09-20,29466070,Sophie,Highly recommend staying with Vicky and her partner - felt like having your own little house - truly looked after - couldn’t not be a better location if you’re on the way to or from the wineries and all the locals are super friendly! Wish I had booked for longer ! Would most definitely stay again. Thanks also for a lovely breakfast and just a beautiful room to stay in!
9891816,327477122,2018-09-24,242744,Erika,"We have a really nice stay at Vicki and John's place. The house is so pretty and everything is well thought out.

9891816,331905981,2018-10-04,19432905,Ulla,We had a great stay in Vicki’s and John’s place. It is so important to have a good night sleep and relax  in the middle of travels and here you really can do it. A bed is comfortable with quality linen and surroundings are quiet. Greenock is a sleepy village and close to so many vineyards. Vicki and John have lived long time in Greenock and they are loaded with local knowledge. They are integral part of local community.

The 2 rooms at the front of her house are given over to a large bedroom with comfy bed and a sitting room with delicious breakfast provisions. The beautiful bathroom is at the rear of the house. The rooms are quiet and private and we would thoroughly recommend a stay for anyone looking to spend time in the Barossa.
9891816,341838947,2018-10-28,72001856,Nick,John and Vicki’s place was a beautiful private room within walking distance of everything the lovely town of Greenock had to offer. They both had a great knowledge of the area providing us with more than enough great food and wine recommendations. John and Vicki were very friendly and approachable people and made Jess and I feel very comfortable in their home. Highly recommended!

9891816,364588717,2018-12-31,34982281,Jay,Vicki and John hosted us for 1 night. It was a short stay but we enjoyed it. They have a lovely place and also gave us some information on the bike tours.

9891816,423356855,2019-03-14,89750214,Colleen,Staying at Vicki’s place was an absolute pleasure. Her place was very charming with a beautiful bedroom and across the hallway a lovely private sitting room. There’s also exclusive use of the large bathroom. The house is within the historical village of Greenoch with a great pub for evening meals 5 mins walk away. Also close to a brewery and cellar doors. The area is perfect as a base for exploring the Barossa Valley. Hopefully we will be back one day!

9891816,436795723,2019-04-14,131444495,David,"With so many perfect reviews we had to see for ourselves. Certainly five stars. A separate lounge equipped with   everything for a self serve gourmet breakfast, whilst in the bedroom, an extremely confortable bed. Older style accommodation, a wonderful welcoming host, and a very clean bathroom at the other side of the house."
10285222,61127044,2016-01-31,40589598,Cameron,"Had a great one night stay in the Ruby suite. This is a one bed apartment attached to others, but is entirely self-contained with private access (including via code which was ideal given our arrival later in the day). Very spacious, with good cooking facilities, and very convenient given location to main street shops and restaurants - we walked to and from dinner out."
10285222,61689890,2016-02-07,27768238,Tess,"Lovely pool area & beautiful old house!
The house is split into 3 or 4 AirBnB accommodations, this one is located at the rear of the house and it is very dark. 
You enter straight into the main room and off this there is a small bathroom and spacious kitchen.
It has been some time since the property was renovated so it's looking a bit tired with water stains on the ceiling and bubbling on the plaster walls due to water damage.
The bed was extremely hard, I actually used the cushions from the lounge to lay ontop of the bed as it was very uncomfortable. 
Loved the pool area but would recommend a Reno & new bed!! "
10285222,74598949,2016-05-16,34935405,Saya,"I don't have a bad word to say about this place! It was brilliant and very Cosey with a lovely kitchen, living space and a fire place as a bonus!
Kym was great and very understanding and friendly despite us having booked this place literally last minute/ same day. She responded promptly and was very patient, and super accommodating.
The fireplace was even set up so all we had to do was put a match on!
The room was in a lovely old stone building with a few original features.
Location was exceptional, right in town, in the lovely tanunda. 
I would definitely stay here again. Hopefully not too many people discover this place! 
Of note, accessing the keys was very efficient and check in was easy. 
Thanks again Kym! "
10285222,116828867,2016-12-03,21799867,Ryan,"A beautiful little apartment, fully equipped for an overnight or week long stay. Great location and great value for money"
10285222,129987442,2017-02-03,34334379,Fishayee,Great location. Nice place to stay after a day of wine tasting! 
10285222,131310472,2017-02-11,31041400,David,"The location is excellent. An old home but quite nice. Would be lovely in winter with the fire or if you had time to use the pool. Biggest downside was the bed, two singles to make a double has a hump in it, but one side is rock hard. Sadly the worst bed I've slept in and I have 130 nights a year away from home. Otherwise it was excellent. "
10285222,198016721,2017-09-28,642178,Kerry,"We were disappointed, the place was dinghy and smelt of smoke.  If you're not a small person you will struggle to get behind the bathroom door to the toilet. The couch is at the end of the bed too close to the TV and you can't watch from bed as the couch is in the way. We found this way over priced and found other much nicer places to stay for much less cost."
10285222,221221894,2017-12-25,77626300,Jamie,"Good location, nice pool and bbq area, nice full kitchen with good quality appliances. Building is run down but only because it's historical. With this expectation in mind it was well worth the money."
10285450,63415264,2016-02-22,57335368,Chelsea,"Memory Lane was a great place to stay at our time in the Barossa Valley.  It was withing walking distance to the main street of Tanunda. The booking process with Kym was very easy and even when I'd forgotten to call to check-in, Kym's team gave me a call and sorted everything out. They were very friendly and made the booking process a breeze."
10285450,73359095,2016-05-08,41321208,Natalie,"Loved this place! I took my mum up to the Barossa for Mother's Day weekend and Memory Lane was the perfect place for our stay, we didn't want to leave! I can't wait to come back during Winter time and make use of the open fireplace. A beautiful home with a lot of character in a great location. It's just like the photos!"
10285450,75428588,2016-05-21,54165858,Natalie,Place was absolutely gorgeous! Thoroughly enjoyed the spa bath too - perfect location for a Barossa visit :)

We loved the fire place which came in very handy as it was quite chilly. Would definitely recommend to others. Thank you"
10285450,93341866,2016-08-12,41203137,Kathleen,Memory Lane was as described & pictured. Was a warm & comfortable place to stay after touring the Barossa in winter - the open fire was especially great after a cold day. We were 6 friends travelling & there was ample room for us all. Very handy location to the main street to be able to walk around town. The team was very easy & quick to respond to all messages. We enjoyed our 1 night visit. Would recommend.
10285450,103133910,2016-09-20,93120489,Amica,"Absolutely perfect for what we wanted, great spacious bedrooms, beautiful gardens and Bbq area. Any questions were promptly answered, check in was easy. The open fire was enjoyed with a port in the evening. Easy walk to the Main Street and all good restaurants. Will be returning. Thanks "
10285450,108317361,2016-10-15,69495179,Tamara,"We loved our stay in Memory Lane. The place is very charasmatic with plenty of space for the 4 of us. Sleeps quite a lot of people though so we look forward to another visit with the rest of our family along perhaps. Lovely little outdoor spaces too to relax and enjoy the serenity.  

Walking distance to the main street so great location."
10285450,112277131,2016-11-05,13868505,Chris,"Kym's Memory Lane is the perfect home away from home. As soon as my wife and I entered the front door, it was as if we were returning to our ideal home. The dignified elegance, thoughtful availability of general food items and peaceful tranquility of the location made this our favourite place to stay in the Barossa Valley."
10285450,116834950,2016-12-03,31881946,Kristy,"Highly recommend. This is a lovely house in a great location, only a few minutes walk in to town and a
 short drive to some nice wineries. House was clean and comfortable and check in /out and communication all great. Suitable for families or a romantic couples getaway. "
10285450,122058270,2016-12-20,92413743,Susan,The location of this accommodation was absolutely ideal. The cottage was clean and tidy and we even got a bottle of bubbly to celebrate our anniversary!
10285450,124887455,2017-01-02,3488178,Dale & Gaby,"This house is very comfortable and has a lot of charm. It is close to everything but provides a peaceful and quiet retreat. We would recommend to couples or groups wanting a comfortable, well equipped and clean base to explore the beautiful Barossa region. Thank you! "
10285450,126426481,2017-01-11,57072813,Lynne,"The cottage matched up to the photos and the location was good but there was no wifi, I was told it was subject to availability, this had not been told to me when I booked, 2 days prior to arrival. I was told that it was available in cafes but as the time difference in U.K. was  11 hours cafe opening times were not appropriate for contacting my family with wifi which I am reliant upon for communication.
I also presumed that the cottage was privately owned and not part of a tourism business. It did lack the personal touches which I've become accustomed to in the many other Australian airbnbs which we've enjoyed staying at."
10285450,131128819,2017-02-10,26658411,Andrea,Lovely little cottage within walking distance from all Tanunda's shops and restaurants. Would definitely recommend!

10285450,330748759,2018-10-01,195134420,Tammy,"Excellent place to stay, clean and well kept. Check in and out was easy.  House is conveniently located a short walk to the main street. Our four legged friends were also very well looked after.  One bedroom downstairs, two bedrooms upstairs.  Fireplace was set ready to light with plenty of wood available to keep it going for the weekend.  Heaters also available in every room.  Would happily stay again."
10285450,422372559,2019-03-11,81743689,Amy,Lovely house that is sparkling clean and in a great location. Very comfortable for two couples and our dog Jack. We very much enjoyed our stay and would come back.
10286738,63503357,2016-02-23,22227682,Chris,We had a fantastic stay with Kym. A beautiful house in a beautiful part of the world.
10286738,64615874,2016-03-06,6413630,Tanya,Kym was very helpful and responded to my queries promptly and with lots of information 
10286738,66157734,2016-03-20,27818692,Liz,The house is charming and in a very quiet spot but still walking distance from the Main Street of Tanunda with its cafes and restaurants. 
10286738,97043556,2016-08-25,54451257,Craig,"Lovely character home, fantastic location, perfect base for exploring the Barossa and beyond."
10286738,105193847,2016-09-30,73654964,安,NICE HOUSE
10286738,106231549,2016-10-04,53521434,Tracey,"This property is certainly well located but is also dated and requires renovating & refurbishing. When we arrived we went to sit out back with a glass of wine but the chairs were covered in ants & the plastic ones stacked up were grubby. We moved out front but that's cozy for 4 people and we moved inside due to mosquitos. The mosquitos also sneak inside and managed to keep us awake 2 out of our 3 nights along with the possums and trees brushing against the roof. 
Amenities like basic kitchen supplies were left for us plus a decanter of port which was a nice touch even though we didn't drink it.  The fireplace was nicely stacked for us to turn on but downstairs can get quite cold and the heating goes straight upstairs making the upper rooms almost overwhelmingly hot if you use the downstairs heater.
I don't think we had any direct contact with the owner after the original booking as this property seems to be managed by an agent but have to say the agent was very pleasant and helpful. Full credit to them for being available on a public holiday when we managed to lock ourselves out. They answered the phone promptly, gave us a solution but offered to come out to help if we needed it. 
This property has good bones and with a little cosmetic help has the potential to be an absolute gem."
10286738,108170194,2016-10-14,23086540,Josephine,"We stayed here for 2 nights. It's comfortable, central to the beautiful town of Tanunda, and our hosts were very friendly and accommodating. "

10286738,127385935,2017-01-17,5580834,Carol,"This was a great size house for 6 adults to stay. Easy walking distance to Tanunda's main street with shops, restaurants and cafes. Clean linen, good quality glassware and crockery were appreciated, as was the powerful air conditioning on a couple of very hot days! They accommodated our two dogs as well, which was really helpful and made for a fuss-free family trip. We really enjoyed our stay and would visit again next time we have a Barossa break."
10286738,131290811,2017-02-11,115741176,Stef,"I reccomend ""a secret treasure"" to all those visiting the Barossa. The house was clean, well furnished and positioned in a perfect location! Thank you for contributing to a wonderful weekend away "
10286738,134357520,2017-02-26,53265525,Fiona,"This is a gorgeous cottage-style home with four generous bedrooms and was an absolutely fantastic place to stay! The team at GetawaysSA made everything so easy for us, including when we wanted to add extra guests and by suggesting a winery tour (which was wonderful, thanks again to John!) they also turned the lights on which made the place look so cosy on our arrival and put the key in the key safe when we let them know we would be arriving past check-in time. The house had absolutely everything we needed including a fully equipped kitchen with all utensils & equipment required to make meals when we didn't feel like going out. Also a courtyard & garden which would be great for alfresco dining or a drink or two. The location is so close to the thriving main street, but not too close. We'd love to stay again next time we are in the Barossa.
Only downsides were the door locks which didn't feel all that secure, the creakiness of the old floorboards, a few dead bugs stuck in the windows and a few wear and tear issues with the property. "
10286738,142152380,2017-04-06,32746365,Simon,"Kym's place was perfect for our large group, close to Tanunda town centre, plenty of rooms and great for a BBQ out the back."

10286738,281501824,2018-06-25,9785772,Kamillah,Myself and my bridal party spent the night here before my wedding. Was the perfect cosy cottage to get ready and have photos taken. Kym and the team even gifted us a bottle of champagne to say congratulations. We were able to check in early and they were always on hand if we had any questions on queries. Highly recommend for a stay in Barossa.

10287444,113988315,2016-11-14,89600870,Courtney,"Unfortunately our toilet got blocked twice which may be a reflection of the old plumbing - however, a plumber was sent out as soon as possible. The communication was great!  The shower head isn't the greatest and water got everywhere - there was no TV remote and we were really disappointed to find no wine glasses in the house. Otherwise we had a lovely stay and was right in town with great accessibility. "
10287444,114935965,2016-11-20,100826512,Elle,"Beautiful house, thank you! "

10287444,194399895,2017-09-16,81365099,Helen,"Lovely fire in the lounge room. Large living accommodation and electric blankets on the beds which was lovely on chilly evenings. 
Easy check in and check out. 
On the slightly pricier side but a lovely place to stay"
10287444,207784924,2017-10-29,35350543,Gina,"Beautifully kept house right on the main street in Tanunda. We were a group of friends enjoying the wine regions after a work trip and this house was spectacular to explore. You very much get an historic sense within the home, however everything has been well maintained in the style of the house. Despite traveling in late October we still got to benefit from the fireplace on a chilly evening (quite a novelty for us!) Perfect location for enjoying the town and visiting local wineries."
10287444,216039329,2017-12-03,142106649,Nick,Clean and comfortable. Easy access to Tanunda township. Would recommend this accommodation.
10287444,216443961,2017-12-03,23018009,Philippa,This house is well located for visiting the Barossa. Unfortunately it smelt like previous guests had been smoking in the house.
10298152,59432494,2016-01-10,10002309,Shaun,Secret Garden was fantastic and Kym was very helpful during the booking process.would highly recommend

"
10298152,80844036,2016-06-20,73704992,Stephen,Although the host wasn't there to welcome us it was easy to to get the keys and make ourselves at home. Central location for restaurants and easy driving access to the local vineyards. Great place to stay. 
10298152,85453940,2016-07-11,2767122,Sandy,"I didn't get to meet Kym, however her staff were really helpful and friendly. The position of the cottage is perfect, step out onto the street. No traffic after 10pm, it was really quiet. Plenty of heating, neat, tidy and clean. Off street parking, perfect for my workplace away from home with heaps of power points and spacious dining table. Loved the local truffle, thank you, the biscuits with a cup of tea making me feel right at home. Tanunda is a picture perfect and hospitable town. Thanks Kym and co. I'll be back."
10298152,102671498,2016-09-18,88181554,Kelly,"Central, clean, well equipped and quaint maisonette in Tanunda. Comfortable beds. Sweet addition to leave a dog toy and bowl (but we brought our own and would have preferred a bottle of Barossa wine ;) Large bathroom with spa bath (although some decent shampoo and conditioner would have been a nice touch). Good communications with the staffwho manage SA Getaways. Just felt it was rather overpriced compared to equivalent accommodation we have stayed in. Thought the additional charges for children under 10 years and for the dog (refundable deposit would be more fair) and for the wifi made it expensive and not great value for money."
10298152,133985706,2017-02-25,9374776,Lindsay & Tim,"Barossa Best is a nice cottage on the main street through Tanunda. Easy walking distance to shops etc. We had a great one night stay exploring the Barossa; the house was spotless, spacious, with private parking out the back. Dog friendly is a big plus, big enclosed area outside for the dog to enjoy. Would stay there again ! "
10298152,140592649,2017-03-30,113447923,Ben,Central location in Tanunda. Nice old style home. Our hosts also ran a private wine tour which was great and recommended.
10298152,164014066,2017-06-26,135735895,Lucy,"Thank you for a lovely stay! We loved how clean and comfortable the house was. It was in a great, central location. We will recommend to others in the future. "
10298152,165114742,2017-06-30,76671733,Matt,"Excellent location, close to Tanunda's excellent restaurants. Comfortable beds and couches. Kym was a great host, able to offer many options for touring the area. Great spot for friends to enjoy the Barossa Valley"
10298152,187903894,2017-08-28,15750257,Michael,"The property was wonderful - as described, clean, plenty of room for three adults and possibly more. The location was excellent, on the main strip in Tanunda and easy walking distance from some great restaurants and cafes. Most importantly, centrally located for exploring many fantastic wineries - would highly recommend!"
10298152,213156301,2017-11-20,54154480,Keng Swee,"You'd love the location of the property to all the beautiful wineries around. Property was easy to get to, parking convenient and right smack in the middle of town."

Situated in the heart of Tanunda it is perfectly located the enjoy local cafe’s and restaurant’s not to mention the world class wineries close by.
We can’t wait to return..."
10298152,263763146,2018-05-13,105523418,Alida,Fantastic home in the middle of town. Highly recommend!

10298152,294261294,2018-07-22,201687463,Amy,Served our purpose wonderfully. Great location to eateries and shops in Tanunda. Amenities were clean and the touches of hospitality really made it an easy and enjoyable experience. Spacious rooms. Would stay again if coming back to experience wineries of Barossa.

10298152,335324879,2018-10-12,208785382,Katrina,This is a delightful cottage that is perfectly located in the main street of Tanunda. It is an easy walking distance to great eating options and other amenities and has a great coffee shop right across the road. The booking process was easy and Kym made us feel welcome from the get go. The cottage is clean and comfortable. For winter it is easy to heat. The bedrooms are huge and the beds comfy and spacious. My only regret is that I didn't make time to use the spa bath in that great big bathroom -maybe next time. There's just so much to see and do in and around the Barossa and this was a perfect base.
10298152,405953016,2019-01-28,47291939,Kelly,"Kym’s communication, information and check in details were great. The indoor spaces were clean and perfect for 2 couples, and the location was within easy walking distance to shops and eateries. Outdoors could do with a good clean and also a tidy up (removal of old and seemingly unused outdoor furniture and plant pots in bad condition). 
NB this spot shares a front gate and front garden with another BnB immediately next door, and the back outdoor areas are adjacent. So, if you’re after complete privacy ‘Barossa Best’ might not be for you. 
If you’re not fussed by overhearing each other’s conversations and don’t mind sharing the front area then go for it!"
10348508,90717586,2016-08-02,76512774,Claudia,"This house is in a fantastic location, walking distance to shops and eateries in Tanunda. Would suit two couples, family or a few friends on a get away. We loved the location, size and vibe of the place."
10348508,94062529,2016-08-14,86617877,Lisa,"Our host was very friendly and let us in to the property and showed us through. The property is very clean and well maintained. The central location meant an easy walk to shops and restaurants. we requested prior to arrival that beds be split and this was done with no fuss at all. The beds were comfortable, the décor was simple and stylish. We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Thank you so much Kym for allowing us to stay at your property. We will be back."
10348508,112362523,2016-11-05,12989830,Poppy,"Central spot in Tanunda, near to cafes and the pub! Clean, spacious and very nice supply of tea, coffee, milk etc. 2 massive beds and handy fold out sofa bed. Friendly, easy contact through agents next door. 'Secret' garden so secret we couldn't find it :) Thanks for a lovely stay."

Will definitely use again!"

10348508,187935738,2017-08-28,33951032,Margaret,"Perfectly situated right in the heart of the main street. We could walk to the pub for dinner, cafes for brekky and then head off exploring easily. But, in side the house, you wouldn't know you're right on the main street. Couldn't even hear the traffic at all! Would stay here again."
10411844,64795648,2016-03-08,34803814,Laura,"We had a wonderful time at Shalamar at Tanunda. Although we did not see Linda or Kate, communication via email was welcoming and prompt.  The spacious, homely accommodation was exactly as described and photographed.  We enjoyed the little complimentary touches – chocolates, milk, spring water, filtered coffee, tea. With disabled friendly seating in the shower/bathroom and no stairs throughout, made travelling and carrying luggage with elderly parents so much easier. Arriving outside of business hours did not pose a problem collecting the house keys. The ducted airconditioning was a welcome relief from the heatwave. Bedding was firm but comfortable with a range of pillows to choose from. The location in a quiet street, close to a great bakery, was the perfect base for wine tasting in the Barossa. I would highly recommend for a family or group of friends. We would love to visit again!"
10411844,67433657,2016-03-29,5147283,Jessica,"My mom and I had a very nice stay at Shalamar at Tanunda. The house had everything we needed and the back yard area was a great place to sit and unwind with a glass of beautiful wine from the Barossa Valley or the local brewery that was just down the road. The house was located very centrally to the town. Even though we didn't see Linda, she was readily available via email/mobile if we needed anything. It was a great house, for our quite short stay. "
10411844,70997939,2016-04-22,65798197,Carmel,Our stay at the Shalamar was very pleasant. The entire place was clean and very comfortable. Easy to find and close enough to walk to the shops. Will recommend it to friends. Thank you Linda

Linda was pleasant and easy to contact. Checking in and out was hassle free. Recommended."

10411844,115225763,2016-11-22,26010125,Helen,We stayed one night at Shalamar. It was a great base for getting out to the Barossa. Linda and Peter were really helpful in allowing us to check in early. They also checked that we were able to gain access to the house given the road works on the main route through Tanunda. Good space and definitely retro styling.
10411844,115763468,2016-11-26,93808743,Louise,"Very cute place, great location, felt a bit like staying at grandma's, in a good way.  We had everything we needed (plus complimentary choccies) with the exception of wifi, but that honestly probably added to the serenity. Loved eating breakfast in the garden full of roses, beds and pillows were super comfy and the shower was great too. We hope to be back! "
10411844,116359701,2016-11-29,51032497,Johanna,"Shalamar was perfect! It is retro styled, very clean and spacious. The location is great for checking out the Barossa Valley.

We were also provided helpful information about road works and closures in the town prior to our arrival. This house has everything you need and is perfectly located for touring the winery region. The air-conditioning was on and the house was cool when we arrived as it was a hot day, which was nice. Oh and there is a fantastic bakery just a few minutes away!"

10411844,164858255,2017-06-29,76429824,Jordan,"Great 3 bedroom home. We were looked after before we even arrived with the heating turned on, on what was a freezing afternoon. Highly recommend."
10411844,166254594,2017-07-03,129780233,Mark,Good value 3 bedroom suburban setting attached duplex.  No complaints but be aware you need taxi to get to restaurants in Tanunda.  Also heating inadequate for Barossa winter.
10411844,167780201,2017-07-08,138654432,Samantha,"Great little house for a small family. Clean, warm and cosy and has everything you need including high chairs and port a cot.

10411844,183316358,2017-08-17,45172013,Janelle,"Linda's place is perfect for a quiet retreat in the Barossa. On this trip, I am travelling with my 85yo mother and Linda's place was perfect. It would also be perfect for a family and 3 couples or a group that would use the 2 double/queen beds(don't know the size) and two single beds. There is a pleasant outdoor area set up well for the cheese and wine prior to dinner. Kitchen a great size and well outfitted for cooking. It's close to town (a significant walk but not unpleasant for the younger generations in good weather). I recommend FermentAsian for dinner - great wine menu. ($20 corkage for byo tho.)"

Good size to spread out a bit and very close to everything we wanted. The road was so quiet and with full black out curtains we overslept two days in a row. Such a welcome relax. Recommend for couples and families and so reasonably priced too.

The house was as described, clean and ready to go. There was plenty of space that we didn’t need as a couple. The air-conditioner worked acceptionally well! 
It is a nice walk away from coffee shops, restaurants/centre of town or a quick taxi ride. 
The bedding was comfortable and the linen was scrumptious! 
Shower has nice hot water. 
We highly recommend Linda’s place - would stay again if we visit Tanunda again!"

Although we didn’t meet in person, I didn’t feel it was necessary to, as everything was easy to find, and I felt if we had a problem, Linda would have been there promptly to sort things out. The house was very clean and tastefully furnished. The beds had lovely clean linen and were very comfortable.
We arrived cold and exhausted from interstate. We walked into the house to find lights on and a wonderful warm welcome, as Linda had thoughtfully turned the heaters on for us. Such a gesture was so very much appreciated. The house was perfect for our stay, I would definitely stay there again, and certainly recommend it to others."

10419152,135379727,2017-03-04,22093066,Jessica,"Great place to stay while exploring the Barossa. Beautiful area, comfortable house, and everything was just easy. Breakfast provisions were a lovely touch. And there are interesting features reminding visitors of the history of the region, and giving the cottage its character. "
10419152,146179784,2017-04-21,10111226,Laura,"We stayed three nights in Dianne's cottage. It was quaint, and very comfortable. The area is secluded and quiet and right in the heart of wine country. The cottage was well equipped with plenty of space, great barbecue, a nice kitchen with delicious breakfast provisions and a very comfortable queen bed. We spent most of our time visiting wineries and went for dinner one night in Tanunda which is only about 8 minutes drive. All in all, a very comfortable stay. "
10419152,205307518,2017-10-22,9024078,Jodie,"Unique cottage, cozy warm, quiet location. It’s a renovated historic cottage in a quiet location in the heart of a number of wineries. Only a short drive to Tanunda. Has everything you need to enjoy your stay. Plus a deep bath tub to relax after a big day in the wineries."
10419152,242428868,2018-03-11,58551019,Katie,"Carob cottage is perfectly located if you want to visit the local wineries without the long drive home after. 
The cottage is very clean and comfortable. I have stayed at the cottage twice and will definitely stay again."
10419152,246141354,2018-03-25,152441392,Christopher,Dianne's place is quite cosy yet spacious and in a great spot if you wish to visit the Barossa with it being right on the doorstep.
10419152,258240189,2018-04-28,181737630,Chris,The house was very lovely and we thoroughly enjoyed out time there.  Given that we were there for a view of the Barossa it was good that you place was close to the wineries.  Thank you for allowing us to stay at your place and you made my Mum's 80th birthday a memorable experience for all
10419152,272699226,2018-06-04,48507176,Adele,"Dianne’s place is a touch of history - a cottage but with all the mod cons.  Excellent location for touring around the Barossa in peaceful surrounds.  A warm welcoming atmosphere here, but watch out for the low door heights, quaint."
10419152,274680695,2018-06-10,52761362,Patrick,"We really enjoyed our stay in this cosy cottage. It’s very close to Seppeltsfield, and convenient for the main Barossa towns."

10419152,338939843,2018-10-21,58494547,Nuala,"Dianne’s place was a perfect place to stay for a weekend trip to the Barossa! Check in was easy, there was everything you needed in the house and the back garden was a beautiful sun trap for a glass of wine in the evening! Only 5-10 min drive to Tanunda, with wineries and a gin distillery on the doorstep, we couldn’t ask for more!"
10419152,341844089,2018-10-28,6893331,Janna Wooby And David Mcneill,"Our stay was lovely, exactly as described and shown"

10419152,352877436,2018-11-26,105300520,Henry,"Carob Cottage was even better than in the pictures. The house was extremely clean and spacious, with fantastic surroundings. It was situated within walking distance of at least 3 wineries and a gin distillery. However, you’d also be just as happy sitting in the cottage’s yard in the sun with a glass of wine enjoying the vineyard views surrounding."
10419152,422398045,2019-03-11,174872519,Kerryn,Gorgeous old cottage.  what a wonderful place to stay and pristinely clean. Great location. Thanks Dianne.

My daughter and I loved spending the night there. 
Plenty of food for breakfast for the two of us.
Electric blankets came in handy on a chilly night and the free wifi was a bonus.
Would highly recommend if you were looking somewhere to stay."
10577770,82635592,2016-06-28,44049183,Keith,"Can't recommend Sue's place highly enough.

10577770,110365760,2016-10-25,33101493,Stephen,"This was a find! Spent our honeymoon here and couldn't be happier. Great location. Quiet. Clean and well maintained. Beautiful back yard to relax in after a hard day touring the local winery's. Also, the Greenock Creek Tavern is a great place for a meal and is just down the road - a 5 minute walk there but a 10 minute return (based on the great wine list!)"
10577770,115106342,2016-11-21,22235327,Canada,A lovely well-presented property in a gorgeous area. The murray st winery was a highlight. Thankyou for having us!

10577770,127074642,2017-01-15,63961309,Alaina,"A hidden gem! We absolutely loved our stay at Sue's! Check-in was a breeze, and the renovated telephone station is such a treat. We loved the breakfast items Sue left, and the beautiful jacuzzi tub. It is walkable to a couple wineries, but only a short drive to more. Would recommend and happily stay again :)"
10577770,129842359,2017-02-02,78448291,Debbie,Beautiful location in the Barossa Valley. The place was very clean and comfortable. Loved staying here.

The apartment is clean and has everything you could need. Breakfast provisions were great. The apartment had a lovely yard which was perfect for our greyhound. Will stay again. 
"
10577770,169528653,2017-07-13,30512506,Jo,"Great location in town and walking distance to the pub, cafe and local tasting room. The house was great and very comfortable. We made use of the fire which was fully equipped. Sue very kindly dropped us off a bottle of wine but the breakfast was not locally sourced produce as stated. Other than that this place was everything we expected and we enjoyed our stay. "
10577770,192687554,2017-09-11,140491052,Megan,"Loved the location, very cute cottage"
10577770,193507968,2017-09-13,27513606,Tracey,"Thankyou for offering such a lovely home. The provisions left by Susan were amazing. The house was lovely and clean in a very peaceful location. The fire was to die for after a day in the vines.
Thanks again Susan we will definitely recommend. "
10577770,214427766,2017-11-25,53902170,Jon,"Sue the host gave us great communication and made a way for us to get in earlier on check-in day. Had a memorable short stay in her beautifully restored/renovated Old Telegraph station, cozy inside and lovely gardens outside. The local and nearby towns also have a lot to offer!"
10577770,277622235,2018-06-16,131247589,Erin,"Great place, cozy and central to everything. Wood fire was great, as were the breakfast provisions. "
10577770,282637551,2018-06-28,60660448,Sarah,Superb village setting with local and convenient food options. Sue was very accomadating of our little one and the fenced yard was child friendly. Beds had good quality linnen and were super comfy. Extra firewood or a few layers may be needed to keep warm inside during the cooler winter months. Enjoyable stay.
10577770,288474762,2018-07-10,26976971,Sue,"This is a lovely place to stay with comfortable beds, great facilities and only a short drive to many great wineries. It is on a main road so it is noisy in the front bedroom. It has a lovely wood heater for winter time. The host left a bottle of wine and yummy breakfast ingredients which was really appreciated. I would recommend this quaint house as a great place to enjoy the local wineries and produce."
10577770,328673459,2018-09-27,10025332,Gillian,"We had a lovely one-night stay in Sue’s pretty and historic cottage, the old Telegraph station in Greenock. 
Warm and clean with comfortable beds and good quality linen. Plentiful breakfast supplies. Wood fireplace was lovely and the timber floors gave the cottage a warm ambience. A nice touch having board games and puzzles available. Neat and tidy rear yard with bbq and outdoor dining, although we didn’t use on this occasion. But good to know it’s there. 
We’d definitely stay here again."
10577770,335012264,2018-10-11,50035721,Karin,"Sue's house is extremely comfortable, has everything and is very pretty! Communication was very easy - Sue messaged us with everything we needed to know, and we found everything we wanted at the house. Sue was very generous with the breakfast provisions - which did us for dinner on one of the nights as well! We found Greenock a lovely little town, and a great place to base ourselves in the Barossa. Great little pub, though we missed out on having dinner there - the night we went they were having a trivia night and were packed to the rafters."
10577770,369017388,2019-01-09,43555197,Kerry,I would highly recommend   sue's accomodation highly great breakfast items supplesd great amenities and close to everything the Barossa has to offer and walking distance to some lovely wine and pub choices

10577770,429750811,2019-03-29,26649371,Jackie,Great communication. Respectful of our privacy. Very kind gesture providing a bottle of wine when having a tradesman visit. Promptly advised us something had been left behind and happy to post. Just a lovely place beautifully set up and a credit to Sue.
10619599,296483132,2018-07-26,46747172,Donna,"Kim's place is in the front and part of a large beautiful home on the main street of Tanunda, residential area.  Lovely garden in the front area. Very handy to shops, cafes & restaurants.  Beautiful high ceilings large rooms very warm & inviting.  Great place to stay & reasonably priced for Barossa.  Good communication & self-check in no problems."
10634089,62443048,2016-02-14,1692419,Joy,"We ended up not meeting Kym because we were driving around the Barossa Valley, but we were able to check in via telephone. The process was easy and we used a code to get into our room. The suite is located in an old house which is divided up into 4 separate units. Bed was comfy, and the ac worked well. We could easily walk up to the main street and found several cafes open for breakfast and had reserved for dinner at the 1918 Bistro. Tanunda is a very charming town, and I wish could have stayed longer. 

The swimming pool was nice, just a bit chilly when we stayed."
10634089,91804921,2016-08-06,86802733,Mark,The booking process was fine however the room was quite tired with a hotch potch of furniture provided and lacked any appreciable decor or theme. It had a lovely wood fire and an old inefficient  split system Air Con that couldn't keep the chill out of the room. Unfortunately the toilet was broken so in the end we decided not to stay the night. The room would probably be fine for most people but at over $200 a night there are probably better options around.  
10634089,100712094,2016-09-10,24780127,Jess,A cute place with charm and beautiful fireplace. The location was superb. Thank you.

10634089,207804139,2017-10-30,2369659,Karina,"The room is quaint and well decorated. It has a full fridge and there are wine and champagne glasses available. It got a little noisy if other guests were sitting at their outdoor area, which is near the entrance to the room. Not having wifi for foreign travelers was a bit hard to stay connected and look up wineries to visit."
10792058,66571475,2016-03-23,62194119,Georgina,"What a beautiful experience!!
From start to Finish Kate and Garry were nothing less than warm, welcoming and friendly.
The property is beautifully manicured with ample outdoor spaces to enjoy and picturesque views all around. We loved our stay here and didn't want to leave.
It was only a hop, skip and jump from the main Barossa Valley Vineyards which we were able to enjoy thank you to Specialised maps Kate and Garry had provided us, highlighting recommended places to wine and dine.. (which were all so good!)
This property is highly recommended for a quiet and relaxing getaway. Thank you both very much !!"
10792058,67209906,2016-03-27,44320905,Alan,My fiancée and I had a very enjoyable two days in this beautiful part of the Barossa region. Kate is a wonderful host who went above and beyond to make sure we  enjoyed our stay. The self catering apartment looks out onto their farm and is ideal for a couple who enjoy their own privacy with an option to interact with the hosts. Sandy the dog was another highlight and is always eager to play. All in all a great country escape with a homely feel.
10792058,69575699,2016-04-11,35757728,Heather,"We spent three nights at Kate and Gary's place and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location is perfect for visiting all the vineyards of the Barossa and the accommodation was delightful. Kate had thought of everything, from fresh breakfast provisions to nibbles for when we arrived. We had a beautiful self contained annexe which was set amidst their peaceful property. Kate and Garry were so hospitable and generous, inviting us to have a glass of wine when we arrived and insisting we stay and have dinner with them on our first night. They gave us some really useful advice on where to go and what to do and all their recommendations were spot on! We'd definitely recommend this wonderful place and were very sorry to leave. We hope all our AirbNb experiences are as good as this one!"
10792058,72201332,2016-05-01,60276007,Jessee,"Would recommend to anyone going to the barossa.. Loveliest couple, best pizza oven! Also have a very good knowledge of the area so very good recommendations too"
10792058,73320311,2016-05-08,68044400,Nic,"Kate and Garry where very welcoming and accommodating from the moment we arrived. On arrival we chatted over a glass of wine and Kate and Garry recommended places to go during our stay. 
Our accommodation was lovely, clean and homely, the contained unit was equipped with everything we needed to enjoy our short stay including  Garry's home made bread :) 
It was a pleasure to stay with Kate, Garry and their beautiful dog Sandy who became our best friend. 

Thanks again for sharing this beautiful part of the barossa valley, we will stay again and have recommended to others."
10792058,74341950,2016-05-15,4292019,Flo&Stef,Nice place with independent accommodation and some great fresh products for breakfast. Kate and Gary are also very welcoming hosts!
10792058,76068115,2016-05-24,2517728,Anastasia,"We really enjoyed our stay at Boongarrie. Beautiful farmhouse with beautiful grounds, green and quiet. Kate and Gary are wonderful welcoming hosts who are happy to share tips about the area and very friendly. The area is a short drive from all amenities."
10792058,76801864,2016-05-29,65529841,Nadia,"My partner and I had a beautiful stay in the stunning Flaxman Valley!

The house is gorgeous, with a beautiful garden and cute farm animals.

Although Kate and Gary were unable to be there, their hospitality was above and beyond. They left us a map of the Barrossa-with favourite spots marked on it, a lovely bottle of wine and delicious breakfast provisions.

Highly recommended!"
10792058,82404683,2016-06-27,6851817,Liam,"Kate's place is an amazing spot. Great set up and only just down the road from some great cellar doors. We spent one afternoon listening to the kookaburras sing from the gum trees around the house, drinking wine next to the fire. Saturday mornings there is a market in Angaston that's definitely worth visiting. Would definitely stay again and why not for the price per night! 10/10. "
10792058,84682627,2016-07-08,11353842,Stephanie,"We loved Boongarrie!

Kate and Garry's property is in an absolutely picturesque part of the Barossa and was the perfect base for our 3 days visiting the wineries. Less than 15mins to Angaston and Tanunda and close by to numerous wineries.

The room was perfect, more like a small studio with a separate bathroom and kitchenette to the bedroom. There were plenty of breakfast foods supplied to keep us going and also a home-baked loaf of bread to greet us! The weather was freezing while we were there but we were super cosy with plenty of blankets and a good heater. The bed was comfy and we loved being able to get to know the dog, Sandy, and all the gorgeous farm animals.

Kate and Garry were wonderful hosts giving us plenty of tips of what to do and see, and even invited us in for wine and nibbles the night we arrived.

We highly recommend this property! "
10792058,85872837,2016-07-13,62063774,Denis,"Comfortable room, nice bathroom, a good little kitchen well equipped and generously stocked with breakfast provisions and fresh home-made products, in a lovely house located in the middle of green scenery, very tranquil with only birds' songs to highlight the quietness. We spent three days at Boongarrie in probably the coldest week of the year, but enjoyed resting in the warm room, especially when heavy hale turned the grounds white, or walked in the paddocks to meet the horses, sheep and alpaca. We saw cookaburras and kangaroos from the verandah. In terms of place Boongarrie was exactly what we were looking for, a quiet place in an old-looking house in the middle of beautiful green paddocks dotted with old and large gum trees, in a hilly area. Easy access to Angaston and the rest of the Barossa Valley for wine tasting and good meals. To conclude we want to thank Kate and Garry for their welcome and sharing their property with us. It was great talking with Garry about the area, the vintners, and Garry's own exceptional experience at the pole! Thanks also for the wine Garry and for the delicious freshly-baked bread!"
10792058,94945478,2016-08-17,82767601,Ian,"Kate and Gary were great hosts and the accommodation was a cosy country experience.

We had so many good experiences staying at Boongarrie that it is hard to pick which one was the best. 
There was meeting Sandy the dog, who has a sweet disposition and loves to play fetch with sticks he finds himself. There is Piper the cat who is very cute. Then there is the plentiful breakfast food provided - eggs, bacon, porridge/cereal, tomatoes and mushrooms. Not to mention the bottle of wine with crackers, dip and cold meats as a welcome. 

However, the experience we enjoyed the most was the impromptu bonfire  lit by Garry. We gathered round it keeping warm and drinking Cabernet Durif, made on the farm, while getting to know each other. 

We would recommend this Airbnb.
"
10792058,98337286,2016-08-30,89744110,Tiara,"We will never forget this beautiful place!  It was so perfect my boyfriend decided to propose to me right there on the property!!! 
I am the happiest girl on the planet and i Thank Kate and her partner for their amazing hospitality and going out of their way to make us welcome and comfortable :)  Highly recommend staying here xo "

Great location in easy reach of all the Barossa goodies.

Highly recommended!"
10792058,105220344,2016-09-30,27080640,Lois,"If you were in SA during the low pressure cyclone this week you needed to be at Kate & Gary's. In the absence of electricity on & off over 3 days, they had a generator to keep basic lights on and the house was safe & cosy out of the wind & gales. 
Kate has thought of everything, from the home-made bread to the fresh eggs & general supplies provided. She & Gary are a great source of information about the local area, right down to advice on how to navigate the flooded & blocked roads. 
They made every effort to make us comfortable to overcome the difficulties that the weather provided. 
There was a gas BBQ in the outdoor area & warm heaters inside (when the power was on). The bed was really comfortable & plenty of blankets provided for the cold. The washing machine was a helpful bonus. 
We would thoroughly recommend Boongarrie in Flaxman Valley. "
10792058,111571607,2016-10-31,32867035,Erich,Great place! Kate and Gary were friendly and welcoming. Thanks for making our stay so awesome! A different side of Barossa that most people don't get to experience either! :)

10792058,113442786,2016-11-12,67834243,Russell,"Kate was kind enough to supply us with directions, which were easily followed, it was only a short drive from Adelaide but once we were there it felt that we were in the heart of the country. 
When we arrived we were greeted my Kate, who straight away may us feel welcomed. All of the rooms were well presented and showed great attention to detail. Really loved the way the property was surrounded by all the farm animals, also found that it was a idea place to visit the Barossa with Tanunda only a short drive away.  Would definitely recommend "
10792058,114651859,2016-11-19,48038466,Heulwen,Beautiful self contained annex in a stunning countryside setting. Hosts were very welcoming and helped us plan our trips around the Barossa Valley. Would highly recommend this place. Thank you for a lovely stay Kate!

An absolutely gorgeous space, surrounded by beautiful farm land, animals and bushland with an adorable pup. 
Kate was super helpful on the lead up and duration of our stay, answering every question and including details for our journey from Adelaide to Flaxman Valley. We were kindly greeted on arrival and taken for a tour through space. Everything was so perfectly set up for a couple or two people ready for an adventurous weekend. Kate included maps and details of all areas we could visit, very thoughtful suggestions especially considering public holidays. The kitchen was decked out with breakfast needs and afternoon snacks along every appliance you may need, including gas BBQ on deck with lovely views, bedroom was private, comfortable and quiet, bathroom clean and spacious. We very much enjoyed our stay at Boongarrie and look forward to visiting again in the future.

Excellent kitchen facilities and basic pantry supplies are provided and we appreciated the use of these for our stay. The scenic outlook was lovely to wake up to every morning and enjoy in the evenings with a glass of wine. 
Lovely company and Kate had many great suggestions for what to do in the area! "
10792058,153107488,2017-05-19,18494705,Anthony,"Kate's place was perfectly situated to explore the region and was a beautiful place to call home. We had a wonderful time exploring the wineries and restaurants in the region and coming back to our accommodation was a holiday in itself. The room was well appointed with all the amenities you need and the breakfast ingredients provided were great for a hearty breakfast before heading out. We really liked the homely feel, the beautiful property and country vista, and appreciated the warm hospitality - including that from Sandy, their happy and playful dog. Would like to return at some point. "

Thankyou "
10792058,176856008,2017-08-01,31004651,David,"Friendly generous hosts. Really liked the supplies and wine left for us.
Attractive cosy place which was so handy to get to Angaston, Tanunda, Eden Valley, Hahndorf, etc. You will need a car.
Beautiful quiet farm location, ideal fo a couple.
Kate and Gary were very helpful with advice on the area. I wish all hosts were like them."
10792058,200282454,2017-10-05,110399455,Patricia,"We thoroughly enjoyed our 3 nights at Boongarrie with hosts Kate and Garry.
Although accommodation was a little cramped especially kitchen area, we were able to enjoy the abundant supply of eggs, bacon, home baked bread, cereal, yoghurt, OJ and other nibbles and fruit. The bottle of wine was also greatly appreciated. Sandy the dog was fun to play with and the gardens and farmland very picturesque. Boongarrie is a short drive to the valley but this was not a problem. The bathroom could be improved with hooks and towel rails, a small issue. A name board at the front gate would also be an advantage. Thanks again Kate for your kind hospitality
Pat and Rob"
10792058,205037811,2017-10-20,26031992,Em,"Kate was a lovely host and the surrounding property is just gorgeous. We enjoyed being welcomed to use their large sun room that looks over the beautiful country and animals; plus there was a great alcove on the deck where we could sit and have a drink by the colourful garden. The breakfast and snacks left for us were plentiful and scrumptious , and the homemade bread loaf was to die for! The kitchenette was well equipped  with all the practical things we needed during our short stay.

Kate was very friendly and had lots of tips for us on where to explore. 
I would recommend this B & B for couples that love the outdoors and want to come back to peace and serenity for a nights rest."

Kate left a very generous amount of breakfast and snack supplies which was a lovely touch. Thank you Kate for a wonderful stay!

Kate drew on a map for us the most interesting places to visit and recommended a few local restaurants. All her advise was gratefully received and proved to be most beneficial and even though we had such a short time to visit we had a great 
time. We plan to go back and stay with Kate again next year."

We highly recommend staying at Kate’s place if you’re after somewhere quiet away from the town, if you love the farm lifestyle and animals."

From enjoying all the sounds of nature in the AM to using the outdoor kitchen for dinner, our entire day was fantastic at their place.  All the amenities you would ever need were there for us and that bed!  Uggh, so comfortable.

We were out wine tasting every day so the location was perfect.  Had an amazing stay.  Lisa and I highly recommend it!"

My partner and I loved the country get away location, feeling far away but close enough to all the wineries and attractions. As bike riders, we also loved being just over the other side of Menglers hill, a stunning view too! The rooms were beautifully presented with all amenities and we felt thoroughly cared for.  The property is gorgeous, as is Sandy the dog who would play fetch all day! Thanks again Kate "
10792058,289263427,2018-07-12,164581563,William,"Quiet and lovely environment. Not forgetting Kate who has been a wonderful host throughout our stay. From tips, suggestion and making home cook soup. Awesome!"

10792058,338192164,2018-10-18,214988912,Brian,Expect warm hospitality. Kate will assist you with any concerns or advice you may need. She helped us plan where to go and what to do during our stay. The BNB was presented well and comfortable. It was like home away from home.
10792058,343522274,2018-11-01,95783235,Dean,"Really peaceful and just far enough away from Tanunda,Angaston etc  so as you feel in the country. Close to the nice walks in the Kaiser Stuhl Park."

Kate's tips were spot on and we enjoyed our time thoroughly. 
I would definitely recommend Kate's place for a lovely stay in the Barossa."
10947532,62635790,2016-02-15,2343373,Elise,"Super friendly, warm and helpful hosts who went out of their way to make our stay special. The property was even more beautiful than in the pictures and has some lovely surprises you don't get to see in the pics. The room has a leafy private courtyard and easy access to the lovely saltwater pool. Excellent breakfast provisions including gorgeous home made jams and marmalades and real milk with cream on the top. Great location for visiting wineries and restaurants. We couldn't have been happier with out choice, it's great value for the quality of the accommodation. "
10947532,63422447,2016-02-22,58434041,Anna,"The Stables proved to be the highlight of our (much too) short weekend stay in the Barossa Valley. The super talented hosts were exceptionally welcoming and delightful to chat with. The accommodation itself is a beautiful stone cottage with views of the gorgeous gardens which have been fertilised with hours of love. The personal-touches in each corner of the room have been perfectly balanced with the history contained in the walls and the modern-day amenities. Location-wise, it was ideal for visiting many wineries and restaurants. When we return to this beautiful region we will definitely be staying at The Stables again but for a much longer period, so we can explore all the hidden gems it has to offer."
10947532,64372522,2016-03-03,34805496,Gail,"Set within the Vineyards of the Barossa Valley this delightful retreat had everything.  Newly converted, the accommodation was comfortable and the hosts very friendly.  We thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Stables and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys mixing it with evening drinks on the riverside deck and enjoying the company of Tibbs the oh so friendly dog.
"
10947532,64864446,2016-03-08,12312790,Phil,We really enjoyed our weekend getaway to The Stables.  The accommodation was perfect and we really appreciated the pool in the hot weather.  The hosts have the right balance between welcoming you and making sure everything is OK  but also allowing you some privacy to relax.  The setup of the building really works well.  We also enjoyed the many sculptures around the property and then meeting the artist was great too.  What a perfect place to explore the Barossa from.
10947532,66998639,2016-03-26,30128798,Stephen,"Just off the main road between Lyndoch and Tanunda is this sweet little farm and generous host. Really enjoyed the space, the garden, the pool and the company of Tibs the dog. Probably suits early risers as there occasional truck noises, rooster crowing and other country sounds. Kay is a real sweetie. "
10947532,67463580,2016-03-29,7389816,Georgia,The stables was the perfect place to start our Barossa adventure. The gorgeous stone cottage had all the charm and character of a country cottage but with all the modern comforts we needed for a wonderful weekend stay. It was extremely clean and tidy and the hosts very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking past the vines to the wonderful riverside deck. The Barossa bike trail also runs past the back of the property which was great to walk along. We couldn’t have been happier with our choice. 
10947532,67646532,2016-03-30,25324655,Kellen,Wonderful visit. A tranquil setting in the middle of wine country. Lovely hosts!
10947532,68492173,2016-04-05,2839836,Hannah,"Kay was an excellent host, offering lots of assistance but also giving us privacy. The cottage was beautiful and just what we were after. The property was also great, with a beautiful deck to sit and read or have a glass of wine. The dogs were also a highlight. "
10947532,68541201,2016-04-05,28326804,Bernadette,"This place is beautiful! Kay made us feel very welcome and the little cottage was very clean and tastefully decorated. Very comfy bed and gorgeous bath! This place is in a great location for wine tasting, restaurants and golf! "
10947532,69709667,2016-04-12,60299042,Jessica,"From the moment we arrived at the Stables, Kay and Madeleine made us feel so welcome. The property is absolutely beautiful with lovely gardens, a vineyard, and quirky sculptures dotted throughout. 
Excellent attention to detail, with so many thoughtful touches: fresh flowers from the garden, bath salts, plenty of extra towels and linens on hand, and fresh local grapes to snack on.
We slept very well in the quiet of the countryside and the bed and bedding were very comfortable.

The best part about the property were the hosts though. Warm and friendly, they were always happy for a chat but gave us complete privacy as well. 

As far as the area goes, we felt very centrally located in the Barossa and had easy access to the bike path and the various towns.
The location in the countryside can't be beat! Close enough to town to pop in for dinner but tranquil and relaxing for downtime.

We'd definitely stay here again.
"

10947532,71856007,2016-04-29,28167255,Tiffany,"Our stay at the Stables was a highlight of our trip to South Australia. The cottage is charming and well-equipped, surrounded by lovely gardens and vinyards. Great Barossa wineries and restaurants are a short drive away. Breakfast fixings were all delicious: homemade jam, apples off the tree, eggs fresh from the 'chooks'! Kay and Madeleine were wonderful hosts, offering advice for touring the area and making sure we had everything needed for a comfortable stay. "
10947532,72722784,2016-05-04,5728990,Sebastian,"Kay was a wonderful host and had great knowledge of the local wineries and most importantly, good coffee! The stables were a beautiful conversion and we had a wonderful time staying - can't wait to go back."

The stables is a beautiful place to stay, located perfectly near Tanuda but not in the bustle of town. The accommodation is everything and more that is shown on the website- I can't recommend staying here enough! We even were able to pick apples and pears from the trees just outside our room! "
10947532,75675388,2016-05-22,59992297,Philip,"We really enjoyed our stay, the cottage is very comfortable and Kay is helpful and friendly. We enjoyed a stroll along the bike/foot path to Jacobs Creek visitor centre, and wine and cheese by the river, with a fresh contribution from Kay's fruit trees! Would definitely return for a longer stay."
10947532,76141223,2016-05-25,36570331,Peter,"What a gem. Lovely accommodation in a 3 acre productive site with vines, chooks and their own produce. If you were looking for an organic place this would be hard to beat. Situated right on the Barossa cycle path but out of town it gave us the sort of access and freedom we wanted. Great bed by the way. Thanks Kay and Madelaine, great to meet you."
10947532,76823560,2016-05-29,10936810,Esther,"We had such a lovely stay at the Stables. Kay and her partner are lovely and very friendly.

The accommodation is spacious and surrounded by beautiful gardens. Their friendly dogs are a bonus! Big bath, comfy bed and even some CDs to set a relaxing mood. The brekky stuff was appreciated, as was the fruit and chocolates. A gorgeous spot, lovely hosts and magnificent surroundings. "
10947532,83490807,2016-07-03,17583101,Patrick & Ava,"The ideal Barossa experience! Kay's place has everything one could think of: beautiful decor, ideal situation, and comfortable living. The space is also thoroughly clean and in great taste, her hobby-farm has all the quaint fittings associated with the area, and to top it off, she is hands-down an excellent host! Highly recommended for all times of the year!  "
10947532,83868127,2016-07-04,24382073,Hazel,"Kay made us feel welcome on arrival and was on hand to help us with directions over the weekend. The Stables were immaculate and Kay provided a well stocked fridge with lovely fresh eggs. 
Perfect location for travelling to wineries of the Barrossa."
10947532,89625144,2016-07-29,1945966,Jessie Carol,"Kay was a lovely host and very welcoming & informative. My sister & i really enjoyed chatting with Kay & her partner and especially cuddles with little Minty the baby lamb :-) The property with the gardens & many sculptures is very picturesque, even in winter & the short walk to the creek & deck overlooking the running creek was a surprise. The property was easy to locate & well situated to explore the Barossa by car. We would definitely stay again if back in the area!"
10947532,92260232,2016-08-08,76690448,Sophie,"We can not recommend the Stables enough! Kay was lovely,  and gave us a warm welcome when we arrived.  She was enthusiastic and very helpful in suggesting things to see and do in the area.  The accommodation was absolutely gorgeous,  like your own slice of Barossa heaven.  It was private and cosy for our winter stay and for summer stays there is a big swimming pool. Rowland Flat is very well situated right by some amazing wineries and close to Tanunda town.  The bike path also goes right past their property! We loved our stay and will definitely be returning. "
10947532,96192238,2016-08-22,6709478,Ellie,"Kay's B&B was perfect for our getaway to the Barossa. You feel like you're out in the country but only a 5 minute drive from the main strip in Tanunda. The studio is very homely, the bed is comfortable and Kay kindly supplied us with the basics - milk, juice, bread, choccies and port. She is also a local and gives fantastic suggestions for places to visit and local knowledge. We loved our stay in the Barossa. "
10947532,98247707,2016-08-30,32321775,Thomas,"Kay was amazing. We may as well have been meeting a relative or family friend who could not have tried harder to make our stay a special one. The spot is incredibly iconic, to walk through her little farm with its metalwork sculptures and rustic outdoor setting looking over a river was an experience in itself. This was coupled with a very cute little private house and a bath supplied with lavender salts and a kitchen with freshly laid eggs! Everyone in the town knows Kay and she was able to point us in all the right directions. Kay, you will be receiving all of our visiting family members who come your way!"
10947532,98949161,2016-09-02,86979292,Coralie,"Staying at Rowland Flat was a pleasant experience for us. The compact and beautifully designed space is private and very comfortable. Kay is a gracious host who made sure we were well looked after. The property is full of beautiful gardens and bountiful chooks, whose lovely eggs were in a basket in the fridge when we arrived. The kitchen is new and nicely done. The old brass bed is not only gorgeous but ver very comfortable. All in all a very good Airbnb experience. Thanks Kay! from Coralie and Peter McKinn"

10947532,101212144,2016-09-12,26093291,Karen,"We loved staying at the stables. The exquisite garden was about to burst into spring colour with the backdrop of vineyards, along with a few sheep and chooks. Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. We loved walking on the bike track through the vineyards which was easy to get to at the back of the property. It was also a very central but quiet location for visiting local cafes and wineries and generally imbibing the joys of the Barossa."
10947532,101318423,2016-09-12,23001142,Cara,"Kay and Madeline were exceptional hosts at their beautiful converted stables in the Barossa. The accommodation was just stunning, well set up with everything you need for your stay. The property has vines, gardens, a pool, a deck overlooking the river, sculptures, animals and more! A great location, close to everything, yet far enough away to feel rural. The highlight for me was the hospitality from the ladies... Thankyou for the conversation and the laughs! Will be back again next year!!"
10947532,102120932,2016-09-16,58965714,Peter,"Kay is a welcoming and engaging host. Stables is a quaint, rustic well-appointed cottage set in a serene garden with Kay's own Shiraz and Grenache vines within close proximity to the Barossa wineries. It would have been easy to stay extra days and get to know Kay better as she is vibrant and obliging host."
10947532,102963060,2016-09-19,1480130,Sarah,"Kay made us feel very welcome. She is an excellent host. The Stables is a beautiful, quiet place to stay. Every little detail has been thought of. Comfortable & super clean. Lovely touches like free range eggs, home made jam & port. We can't wait to plan our next trip to the Barossa to stay at Kay's place. "
10947532,104259874,2016-09-25,27832520,Emily,"Kay was fantastic!!! we loved every minute at the stables!!!! Kay supplied eggs, fresh bread, milk and juice for our stay along with some  yummy choccies and port! We loved waking up to the beautiful gardens in the morning! Kay helped us with choosing wineries to visit during our stay and was a pleasure to be around! The property is fantastic and close to everything! We will make sure we stay with Kay again on our next visit to the beautiful Barossa!"
10947532,105441169,2016-10-01,46533776,ChrisandWilf,Great place in fact perfect for us. Close to vineyards and everything you expect in this area. Caring hostess.
10947532,107254761,2016-10-09,9711288,Susan,"Kay was such an amazing host! I was visiting the region with a group of friends (who were staying at the Novotel), and she was really accommodating with the time of arrival (late afternoon, after some wines!). The place was very clean and tidy. It had everything I needed, including some delicious eggs from her chooks! The whole place is beautifully done."
10947532,108697012,2016-10-16,25331424,Judith,"The Stables are a charming and beautiful BNB. The hosts are very friendly and helpful and our stay was made extremely pleasant by their interaction and manner. The rooms are exactly as described and very homely and comfortable. Spring had certainly sprung in the surrounding gardens full of lavender, roses, rosemary and fruit trees. Rowland Flat is very close as is Tanunda, both charming towns full of stone cottages and interesting shops, restaurants and cafes. The Stables is conveniently located in the Barossa Valley and is close to many famous wineries. We drove from Adelaide through Lyndoch to Rowland Flat which I would recommend to others. This journey is through the Adelaide Hills and although slower than the motorway far more picturesque. "
10947532,109018162,2016-10-18,2441305,Bas And Heather,"We loved our 3 day stay at Kay's 'Stables'. It is comfortable and in a lovely, quiet part of the Barossa Valley, yet close to everything it has to offer. It live up to the description and then some."

The property was as described a very cute cottage! It was spotlessly clean and it felt like a home away from home. Breakfast was supplied with muesli and free range eggs from the chickens! It is an ideal location for exploring the Barossa and surrounds and Kay and Madeline made us feel very welcome! We will be recommending this property to friends and family when traveling in the Barossa area! Thanks for our lovely stay!

They take great pride in their gardens and the hard work has certainly paid off - wow! The property is even better than described and cleanliness absolutely exceptional. Breakfast was supplied, with eggs coming from their very own free-range chickens. The location couldn't have been more perfect for exploring the Barossa and we will certainly be coming back to stay; we have never felt more at home at someone else's place and never before welcomed with such love! Thank you Kay and Madeline!

I would definitely stay with Kay again when next in the Barossa"
10947532,114491494,2016-11-18,23199962,Emily,"I would highly recommend this place if you are heading to the Barossa. Very good location with many wineries only a couple of minutes away. Also very close to Lyndoch, which is a small town with restaurants and cafes. The property itself was beautiful, it was like a quaint English cottage. The house has everything you could need, with eggs and milk provided in the fridge and your own private outdoor seating area. It was truly idyllic. And Kay was a fantastic host! She was very welcoming and accomodating. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!"

10947532,115229141,2016-11-22,101003296,Damon,"Upon arrival we were greeted by the welcoming committee of Tibbs & Jassie, Kay's gorgeous dogs. Kay showed us to our accommodation and settled us in and made us feel at home right away. There aren't enough superlatives to describe how gorgeous the accommodation and property were. The cottage was stocked with everything we could have asked for, and the free range eggs from Kay's chickens were about the best we've ever had. We cannot recommend this property enough and we wouldn't want to stay anywhere else the next time we visit the Barossa!"
10947532,116085274,2016-11-27,12524624,Renee,"We had the best time staying at The Stables, from the first smiley greeting from Kay to the last hug when we left.

10947532,125436913,2017-01-05,50583286,Sarah,"I would highly recommend Kay's place. Every inch of the house oozes comfort, style, and rustic farm-style charm. Although I planned to spend time in the gorgeous claw-foot bath, I found myself too busy enjoying the pool which was a welcome relief from the summer heat. The most gorgeous little hand-made stools offer a lovely view of a beautifully tended and well-thought out garden. Kay left eggs from her hens in the fridge for us so we were fully equipped for a little breakfast. She was gracious and old wordly enough to even leave out some complimentary port! We were thoroughly comfortable there and Kay was a bit of a delight to meet and chat with. The grape vines are literally just over the fence offering a beautiful outlook and there is also a little stream nearby to soak up the sunset at a portable set of table and chairs. I can't rave about it enough. Just go. Stay a while. Barossa a lot. "

10947532,142600889,2017-04-08,90214812,Nigel,"I stayed with Kay in the days leading up to my wedding and my wedding night. Kay and her partner were fantastic, caring and helpful - even helping to fix my father's boutonniere, which had the rose head fall off while we were getting ready on my wedding day.

It was the little touches too, like a congratulatory note on the chalkboard, a bottle of bubbles and an awesome bath bomb for our wedding night."

From the scented garden, free ranging chickens to the warm hilarious hostesses with the mostess. We had such a chilled food frenzied long weekend in the Barossa and couldn't think of a more gorgeous place to stay. The Stables are straight out of a country style editorial. Perfectly refurbished with all the right touches. Highlights were eating fresh eggs for brekky, taking a soak in the  claw foot bath, and binging on books on the verandah. Thank you for making us feel so welcomed in your slice of paradise Kaye and Madeline XX"

The bed was fantastic, the bathroom deluxe and the serenity was second to none. There were fresh eggs and coffee in the morning, topped off by a peaceful wine on the deck, at night. We loved watching the Kelpies and Polly the horse roam free, amongst Kay and Madeleine's home grown vines. 

The location was perfectly placed between Lyndoch and Tanunda, allowing for a short drive to many wineries - there are even a few that are in walking distance!
We felt extremely safe and secure whilst staying here and would absolutely visit again. 

Thanks to Kay and Madeleine for a relaxing and refreshing long weekend! They're truly welcoming humans with a knack for running a BnB."

Gorgeous quaint cottage, picture windows filled with sunlight, beautifully furnished with personality and stunning surrounds. Kay really has nailed the set up, thinking about all the little needs and delights that guests hope to find and provided a lovely brekkie with self-contained kitchenette to cook it up in! Highly recommend walking past the vineyard, past the horse and chooks, up to their deck which overlooks the river. If you are a light sleeper you may hear the odd vehicle on the nearby road during the night, although nothing to put us off coming back. Thanks very much for having us Kay and your hospitality.

Kay and Madeleine were such wonderful hosts - warm, welcoming, and so hospitable. They were very willing to offer suggestions and recommendations for out-of-towners. The Stables is in a great location - at the start of a nice stretch to Tanunda with more than a handful of wineries on the way. We definitely recommend borrowing the bikes - the bike path is beautiful (slightly challenging for a wine lover but definitely worth it for the view - and the wineries along the way!). The Stables was the epitome of country charm - it was lovely to wake up with a view into the private gardens, enjoy a long hot soak in the claw foot bath, and partake in a leisurely breakfast of local produce including home-made preserves and fresh eggs! We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this AirBnB and hope to visit again soon. "

We got there late but they were around with the electric blanket and heater on:) There was coffee, muesli eggs and bread in the fridge for breakfast and a carafe of Barossa port to ease us into it.

This is a great location if you have an event at the Novotel as it's walking distance. Kay hires out bikes and you can easily ride or drive to Tanunda and a whole bunch of great restaurants and wineries. 

We had a great stay, highly recommended."

Chooks, a horse and beautiful (Website hidden by Airbnb) truly a fairytale. The bed is super comfy and the home is equipped with everything you'll need, not to mention a deep claw foot tub with homemade bath salts and candles. The place backs up onto a sprawling vineyard and a short walk takes you to a verandah overhanging a beautiful river below. It's a little paradise. Kay is absolutely fabulous and even left us fresh eggs and bread and port. We had a lovely stay and are dreaming of returning one day."

Its the little things that make The Stables special - the provisions left in the fridge, home made bath salts, the ironed bed linen (AMAZING!), cosy decor, gardens and surrounding views, the list could easily go on! We can't wait to return, perhaps in the summer when the pool is in action."

Between the fruit trees, vines, dogs, horses and chickens - what a fun experience. And the stable cottage was beautiful with small touches everywhere - including apple juice, chocolates and a tasty dessert liqueur. I rented a bike and hopped on the convenient bike trail (literally along their property) and easily toured the local wineries and road into town for some food.  After a long day of riding, I came home and took a bath in their amazing clawfoot bathtub with some provided bath salts. What a great place. Highly, highly recommend!"

Kay is definitely the nicest person in the Barossa (or maybe even Australia). From gorgeous homemade jams, fresh happy chicken eggs, homemade bath salts, and the list goes on, you won’t find anywhere better to stay in the Barossa. Kay and Madeleine (also equally nice) have two very cute dogs, two very friendly horses, their own vineyard, pool etc. In terms of location, the are very close to so many wineries and cute towns.

The cottage is surrounded by a beautiful garden, and beyond that vineyards and forest.  Whether sitting out under the verandah at the back of the cottage, or sitting at the kitchen bench top looking out the window, the views and general ambience are superb.  The cottage itself was well laid out, and very clean, and Kay's attention to detail and thoughtful touches - eggs from her own chickens and local milk in the fridge, ground coffee and quality muesli in the cupboard, chocolates and port - made for a thoroughly enjoyable stay from start to finish.  We cooked dinner each night on the BBQ at the back of the cottage, and also particularly enjoyed walking along the cycle/walking path that runs along the back of Kay's property, alongside a creek with wild olive trees and then on through the vineyards to Jacob's Creek and St Hugo's.  Highly recommended."

The port, fresh eggs, bread and juices were lovely. Kay and Maddy were very welcoming and always keen to give us local advice. We decided to use public transport and the hire bikes which was a great way to get around, with the property backing on to the bike and walking path that links up to Tanunda and beyond. The space with a lovely wrought iron bed, big free-standing bathtub with legs and a breakfast spot overlooking the garden is the perfect opportunity for a very relaxing holiday.

The property is a beautiful and charming country cottage fitted out to perfection and set in the most beautiful vineyard alongside a creek which is overlooked from a secluded deck on the property.

We did a great early morning walk (30-40 mins) through her paddock onto a bike / hiking trail that heads to Jacob's Creek winery that gave us some beautiful vistas over the vines. We had to cut our stay short due to family circumstances and Kay was very understanding. She gave us a list of villages to stop in on our way back to Adelaide, travelling through the Adelaide Hills which we thoroughly enjoyed."

The hosts are amazing, very Barossa wise & have a lovely garden surrounding this beautifully restored cottage.

Kay provides a gorgeous supply of breakfast ingredients, all local or home made. the tranquillity of their home is food for the soul. Loved the deck area overlooking the creek too. The property is very close to enough wineries to fill at least a weekend, Jacob's Creek, Rockfords and Lou Miranda were our favourites. We cycled to the wineries as the property is very close to the bike track, which was quite challenging but worth it. One of the best airbnb properties we have stayed in and we have stayed in many, all over the world."

Great to have a private pool to yourself and the deck is a picturesque spot for evening drinks. The bed is firm if this is your thing and the cottage is very nicely styled and clean. We loved the friendly dogs and chickens! The hosts were great at giving local tips of where to go and what to see throughout our stay."

10947532,410197065,2019-02-09,2261713,Christine,Kay's place is one of the best airbnb places I have ever stayed at. The place has everything you would need for a getaway trip to Barossa! Kay is a lovely host
10947532,412144121,2019-02-14,55504936,Jo,"We use Air BnB a lot for travel. The Stables  has been our best stay yet.  This property is second to none.  A truly unique experience.  Set amongst the vineyards and tucked away in a quiet spot just outside of Tanunda, but within a stone's throw of Australia's best wineries.  Chooks on site providing fresh eggs each morning.  A beautiful deck over the creek frontage.  Immaculate gardens.  Swimming pool.  A gorgeous cottage.  I can't recommend this place enough.  Kay and Mads were the best hosts we have encountered, providing wonderful tips about local restaurants and sites.   We felt like we were staying with old friends.   This property is the gateway to everything the Barossa has to offer.   Book!  It will far exceed your expectations"

10947532,419432628,2019-03-03,12493252,James,"We stayed in Kay’s cottage for 3 nights. Perfectly positioned just out of Tanunda, it’s a cute little place with chickens, dogs, a swimming pool (which was great when 40C), a veggie garden and deck overlooking the river. The place itself is super cute with everything you need, including eggs from the resident chickens for breakfast. Would stay again :)"
10947532,420829909,2019-03-08,18998046,Sally Anne,"We had a fantastic stay at The Stables.

Highly recommend!"

10947532,425314940,2019-03-18,140695216,Samantha,We had an amazing time at The Stables and would definitely return. The photos don’t do the space justice it’s just gorgeous. We loved the walking track and the pool was beautiful to swim in! Bed was very comfortable and we enjoyed the port! The Stables is perfectly situated to all of the best wineries and the hosts local knowledge was great. Thanks for having us!
10947532,427097579,2019-03-22,110460342,John,"Great venue for exploring Barossa Valley on Kay's bikes. Or if a partner likes to golf, there is a coure nearby. If this is the standard of Airbnb can't wait to book again."
10947532,430123542,2019-03-29,21204760,Mal,"The Stable is a well appointed and is a beautifully serene spot. Kay is an awesome host and we love staying here. The little touches like her home made bath salts, locally produced port and chocolates are amazing. We are looking forward to our next stay with Kay."
10947532,433714750,2019-04-07,51464383,Jacqueline,Kay's place is ideally situated for a wine tour of the region and proximity to great restaurants.  To begin the day with the sound of silence and later the native bird chatter was lovely!
10947532,435921716,2019-04-12,22222662,Sarah,"Staying at Kay’s was the perfect way to end our time in SA. She is gorgeous and her little cottage was just divine, exceeded our expectations for sure. Kay is friendly, approachable and was so easy to communicate with. Highly recommend if visiting the Barossa. Ideal location and just so peaceful. Suggest making up a picnic and enjoying her beautiful decking out the back of her property. Stunning views! Missing it already x"

10971607,84393090,2016-07-07,73686754,Anna,"We have just had a wonderful stay at the Angaston Masonic Lodge !
Firstly we were welcomed by a cosy fire, a surprise platter and a bottle of wine . Then a spacious apartment that was both very comfortable and clean. We were really appreciative of off street parking being on the main strip of Angaston.
The Masonic Lodge was a perfect central location for the Barossa wineries and HOSPITABLE eateries as well.
We found Robyn to be a thoughtful host that is clearly passionate about creating an appealing , homely and relaxing ""bnb"". We look forward to returning to Angaston Masonic Lodge again !
Anna and Friends."

10971607,115130553,2016-11-21,91763584,Natalie,"I am so excited to write this review. We had the most wonderful experience staying in Angaston at The Masonic Lodge - and it was all because of our host Robyn. 
This was my first holiday travelling with Bub, 8 months old, and we were flying so I was pretty nervous.
When I told Robyn we were travelling with a baby, she went well above what I ever expected.
Robyn organised a high chair, change mat, helped me organise a portacot, made me feel confident there was a supermarket / chemist  across the road that had everything I needed. Which was perfect we were flying.
We arrived to a smiling face and a welcome pack of nibbles, cheese and wine - aircon was on and the lodge just felt like a home.
We stayed for 5 nights and I just didn't want to leave! The bed was so unbelievably comfy! 
It just kept shocking me of all the things Robyn thought of, from supplying absolutely everything we needed (shampoo/conditioner, body wash and I mean top quality products), to a little medical kit of panadol and bandaids!
As we were new to the area, I texted Robyn throughout our stay and she assisted with our every request.
The lodge had such a glorious heritage feeling and the styling just made me feel like I had stepped back in time, from the original piano (I think over 100 years old!) to the high ceiling (I mean very very high!)
I informed Robyn we wanted to have a BBQ so she set up an outdoor area with an umbrella with all utensils, oils etc.
I would highly recommend in staying here, we will definitely be back :)
Thank you Robyn for your incredible hospitality. Angaston is an incredible little town and The Masonic Lodge is right where you need to be."
10971607,207297252,2017-10-29,130525649,Peter,"The check in procedure, facilities and service was super!!
Loved the local wine and cheese board waiting for us along with food for a great cooked breakfast the next morning"
10971607,248638377,2018-04-01,20287280,Neil,"Brilliant accomm, right in the middle of Angaston in the midst of the wineries, great, big, comfy space to relax, celebrate and have a great time! Thanks Robyn for all the extra little touches to make our time even more special, from the cheese board to the Easter eggs, it made our time even more enjoyable."

11088204,66446315,2016-03-22,4369146,Andrew,"I really enjoyed my weekend in the Barossa Valley, staying two nights at Brett and Renee's house. It's in a neat location just across the road from very chilled out Barossa Brewery (also a pub/restaurant - does great pizza), and this is also one of the stops on a new hop-on, hop-off service, Barossa Explorer, which I used to tour various wineries without having to worry about drink-driving laws. The house is one of the oldest in Tanunda and has a lot of charm and character or what estate agents call period features, but happily the spacious bathroom is from the modern era rather than Victorian times. There is a lovely decking area outside with a barbecue."
11088204,67506172,2016-03-29,23664929,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay at Brett's and Renee's place. The cottage was cosy and we felt at home.

I felt very much welcomed and got a complimentary bottle of wine. Those two days made me very happy and I wished I could visit it again soon.

11088204,128638064,2017-01-26,11404595,Sue,Highly recommended. The cottage is beautiful and really well equipped. The king sized beds are extremely comfortable.

The garden and wine cellar will make you want to stay in and cook yourself, or if you want to dine out, it's just a quick stroll to great restaurants and cafes and shops. Such thoughtful hosts also. Everything you can want is here. King-size beds and a cozy living area, a jacuzzi spa in the private garden is better than any resort I've been too. Highly recommend this gorgeous cottage. "
11088204,131947719,2017-02-14,29355976,Sally,"This beautiful cottage has everything you could want! Big comfortable beds, all the amenities you could wish for. Gorgeous garden & patio. The jacuzzi was devine! And the location is fantastic! 
The wine cellar was really cool, however exposed brick made it too dusty for us to use. 
The only fault, was the musty smell in the lounge. As a hey fever sufferer, I couldn't be in that room & the other guests also struggled. If you're not used to old dusty places, I would only recommend staying here when the weather is nice & you can stay outside. The bedrooms didn't smell though & had ceiling fans which kept them cool.

The fireplace was fantastic, lovely comfortable king beds and everything you could possibly want and more! We couldn't believe there was a cooler bag to take on our picnic. The outdoor jacuzzi and cellar dining room were highlights. The welcome platter was delicious. Located in the beautiful township of Tununda and surprisingly not too noisy considering its close proximity to the main road. We will definitely be back to enjoy this little treasure!!"

The little treats left for us by Renee were a very nice touch.  The cottage is located a short walk from the main strip of Tanunda with cute little shops and cafes, there is some noise from the passing traffic but that's a small price to pay for the location and the lovely cottage, would definitely recommend to anyone.
Thanks for a lovely stay."

Quiet and well equipped, it had everything we needed. The beds were massive and so comfortable, the spa was a nice touch and Renee was a pleasure to deal with. I would highly recommend staying here if you're visiting the Barossa."

Comfortable, cheerful and clean. Highly recommended! Renee was incredibly helpful and a fantastic host and this really contributed to us having a great time on our short break.  If you stay try breakfast up at Darlings Food with Passion in Tanunda - excellent coffee and service and only a 5 minute bike ride away from the cottage."

If heading to the Barossa you must include this place high on your list. You will not be disappointed. Possum Cottage caters for everything as does Brett and Renee. Very private and secluded yet in the middle of everything. You could not want for more. We will be back.

The 3 person spa - bikes free to use. 
Cheese platter and food available if you need it. Comfort of the cottage and garden was simply perfect! There is no WiFi but to be honest we all need a little less WiFi in our lives.... this is the place to do it. Oh and you are almost walking distance to wineries and defo short stroll into town. But we loved the bikes...."

They've even included plastic glasses so you can enjoy some wine whilst relaxing! The cottage has everything you'd need!! Utensils, a pizza oven, even a popcorn machine! It's so warm too! The main bedroom had a HUGE king bed, so comfy! The owners are great! They even got me a little birthday present! We can't wait to come back!"
11088204,298866013,2018-07-29,59140708,Debra,"Our stay at Possum Cottage was absolutely perfect, the photographs and description of this cosy home do not do it justice. I visited with my partner for a birthday weekend of wine tasting and relaxation.
Brett & Renee prepared some special touches for my birthday which were very much appreciated, including wine and treats, and birthday messages around the house :)
Possum Cottage is a beautiful cosy and warm home, lots of character, with all the amenities you could need (and more!). Brett & Renee really have thought of everything! 
The cellar/dining room is stunning, perfect for entertaining. The kitchen superbly equipped and made self catering very enjoyable, especially eating dinner in the cellar during the evening! 
There were bikes available at the cottage to rent, in perfect condition (possibly brand new) and with helmets and lock already provided. This was so convenient, and a fabulous way to see the Barossa Valley. Cycle tracks are all around and there was a basket to easily carry picnic / wine purchased. 
The bed was huge & super comfy, with lovely bedding. The lounge was cosy and warm, and hundreds of films available to watch, with blankets to get comfy for the evening.
Plenty of space to eat or entertain outside, beautifully kept garden and yard, and a generous sized hot tub (in its own cute outdoor room with lighting and bathrobes)
Brett & Renee also provided directions from the airport, taxi & takeaway numbers, recommendations for wineries and restaurants, and their communication was excellent. We did not see the hosts at all during our stay, we had contact details if needed and were left in private for the weekend.
I could not recommend this accommodation enough - dont even look at anywhere else - Possum Cottage is superb."

11088204,331185756,2018-10-02,58785694,El,"Our stay at Possum Cottage was amazing! My partner and I stayed for two nights to celebrate his birthday and can honestly say our expectations were exceeded. The location is perfect right on a Main Street, but never at any point was it too loud. The garden that winds up toward the cottage was so peaceful to sit in and we enjoyed sitting in the hot tub to wind down after a day of drinking wine. If you choose to stay in there are plenty of movies, books and board games to keep you entertained and the bedroom has a luxurious king bed to stretch out on.

I highly recommend anyone to stay at Possum Cottage. You won’t be disappointed."

11088204,367890260,2019-01-05,201506833,Nicolle,"We had a wonderful weekend away. Fantastic private courtyard felt like we were away from everything and was just what I needed after an extremely stressful week at work. As soon as we entered this delightful little courtyard from a private back entrance away from the road, I immediately relaxed.
Walking distance to Tanunda township was great. 
The bed was extremely comfortable with good quality linen. 
Spent many hours enjoying the jacuzzi. 
Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Would recommend to anyone wanting to spend a weekend in the heart of the Beautiful Barossa."
11088204,405893963,2019-01-27,45127913,Ashleigh,"I don't even know where to begin. Quite simply, this was the best Airbnb we have ever stayed at. The gorgeous, private garden area was jaw dropping. The outdoor jacuzzi was amazing. The wine cellar was stunning. The kitchen and pizza oven were incredibly fun to cook in. The bed was super comfortable. We came back to the Cottage to eat in every night because we loved it so much and didn't want to waste any time being out in the hustle and bustle. Renee & Brett are also incredible hosts with some very generous and thoughtful touches placed around the house for us. I only wish we had stayed longer to have more time in this beautiful place. Don't hesitate, book it!"
11088204,427528187,2019-03-24,13935320,Jenette,"Brett & Renee's cottage made our trip to Barossa very special. They are thoughtful, communication was superb, and amenities was as advertised. We highly recommend staying at Possum Cottage. It was located close to the town and we enjoyed cycling there using the bicycles provided by Brett & Renee. We really enjoyed our stay!"
11102930,64972946,2016-03-09,3884758,Meredythe,this property is in a very central location.  you are able to walk to town.   property was equipped with what you need.   i would not call it a 1.5 bathroom.   it is a 1 bathroom place but the toilet is in its own room.    looking at the other property the hideaway vs this -the hideaway central- as it looks a bit more modern and has air con.  so it would be a better value for money
11102930,66512505,2016-03-22,23982787,John,"The place is convenient, spacious, clean, and perfectly set up for two couples. Unexpected nice touches included coffee-pods, some kitchen supplies, and even fresh grapes from the recent harvest. I would stay here again."
11102930,67018559,2016-03-26,29835251,Arnold,Our host made us feel really welcome - leaving us fruit and a welcoming letter.  We felt right at home immediately.

11102930,68818761,2016-04-06,11828161,Chris,An older style property but located on the main street so very close to shops and restaurants.

Everything was clean the bed was comfortable. Barbie provided clear written information for our arrival and welcomed us to ring her if we had any questions.
The unit is in the main street and reasonably quiet over the time we were there. The Foodworks supermarket  as well as the shops and restaurants were within a few minutes walk.
The accommodation is in a great location to access the wineries of the Barossa Valley by car, including Maggie Beers farm shop- Pheasant Farm. 
All these things added to a lovely stay in Tanunda."

11102930,86864014,2016-07-17,82773053,William,"This was actually my very first experience of using AirBnb and I can confidently say that yes I will use the service again and that I will most certainly be contacting Barbara again for future stays in South Australia. Communication was fast and consistent through the whole trip right from the word go. 

The house is'elf was perfect, nothing too fancy, but had everything that we needed and all equipment was working fine - the heater saved our lives! The location could not be improved at all, ideal location for the Barossa, literally a 10 or 15 minute drive to anywhere you need to be (that is, if it wasn't already a 30 second walk away). 

We felt secure and safe inside the house (which was incredibly clean) and Barbara was adaptable with our fluid arrive time, giving us tips and advice along the way. Upon arrival we even got a welcoming card and some bickies - it had a warm, home-style type of feeling and we loved it! 

In conclusion, stay here, stay here, stay here..but don't stay here too often as we'll be back and want to book it too :P "

11102930,91534756,2016-08-05,6958116,Monica,"Nice place! Perfect location in Tanunda within walking distance to lots of cafes and restaurants. Exactly as described and very clean. Super comfortable beds.

It was very cold when we arrived home after dinner, so make sure you turn on the heat in the living room immediately if you're here in the winter! It takes a while to heat the bedrooms, so you want to get it going ASAP. I just took a nice hot bath to stay warm :)!

Mia Pizza is good, as is the Clubhouse for food. Both are walking distance. Renting a DVD will cost a $25 deposit if you aren't a member -- it's returned in cash when you bring back the movie."
11102930,98933195,2016-09-02,49588207,Annette,"Tried to make us welcome. Left a little card and bought biscuits.

Just be aware that it feels like a '70s home that hasn't been remodeled. And if you are very sensitive to odors, it may not suit you too well. Otherwise, neat and clean and the beds were comfortable."

Letting ourselves in was super simple with a code provided by Marie-France. The house had plenty of space and in winter we were very grateful for the heater in the living room.  We would have loved to have more pots and pans to use to cook meals with as there really wasn't enough. We booked very last minute and were grateful to find this cosy place.

Our flights had been messed around so we were so pleased when we finally arrived in Tanunda to a spotlessly clean home. We had been given great information on how to access the house, the location in Tanunda was perfect. All the shops, coffee and wineries were a stones throw away- perfect for walking. The main bed was extremely comfortable and once again a clean, very clean place to lay our head and call home for a couple of days. Brilliant as we could also park the car in a driveway and could have fit another if needed. Thank you to Marie-France."

It's nice and quiet, and the two bedrooms are at the opposite end of the large villa so perfect for couples sharing. As it's an older villa the space is huge, the kitchen is well equipped, separate dining and lounge-room quite spacious as well. We would definitely stay again. "

11102930,252973787,2018-04-13,138495139,Rena,Great location but needs a bit more care and attention to cleanliness as it does not present well at first glance.
11102930,256548275,2018-04-23,126376851,Dee,"The location is amazing. We were surprised by the size of the house - it was big and spacious. There is a full kitchen and dinning table etc if guests wanted to use it (we didn't but good to know there is option).  

The beds was very comfortable and fresh clean crisp towels were provided, which I absolutely love! 

We were bit confused by lights & fan combo in the main bedroom - this never worked so I always felt a 'bit in the dark'. I ended up using the spare fan provided.  I would recommend taking a power board or something if you have multiple devices to charge as I ended up charging mine in the living room as I was using the 2 visible power points in the bedroom for fan and bedside table .

Main bedroom doesn't have 'net' curtains so we can't let any natural light in without the whole room being visible on main street and compromising privacy.  Also note that the washing machine is not meant for use. 

We liked that everything in town was walking distance to the house so we didn't need a car. The house was very homely and cosy with really cool paintings and personal touch. We spend evenings resting comfortably on the couch after our day tours before walking into town for dinner."
11102930,258282186,2018-04-29,184684335,Craig,The unit was as described and very clean. Would recommend this place to anyone and the host was very easy to deal with.
11102930,263755892,2018-05-12,53661835,Jesse,Marie was so accommodating! Really made our weekend great ! The location is absolutely amazing! Walking distance from everything in Tanunda !
11102930,265972264,2018-05-19,44626958,Margaret,"Whilst location was absolutely tops and apartment adequately furnished, it did  lack  items that would add to comfort; inadequate heating; lights &  heaters not working; the one bathroom poorly outfitted if used by more than 2."
11102930,268104878,2018-05-24,87814070,Paul,Although this place is on the main street in town it was still very quiet at night. Walking distance to great food.
11102930,269733038,2018-05-27,23787657,Dimitra,You couldn't pick a better place to position yourselves for a holiday in the Barossa. The villas are right in the town centre yet so quiet and peaceful...and the bed was super comfy!! Highly recommended!!
11102930,275432738,2018-06-11,183780939,Danielle,"Great location, close to the shops and cafes. "
11102930,279493301,2018-06-20,18310598,Phillip,Great location and huge space.  The apartment was nice and warm when we arrived 
11102930,281475647,2018-06-25,27936470,Madeleine,The Airbnb was in a wonderful location right in the center of Tanunda. Bed was really comfy and heating was great for the chilly weather. Some improvements to the furniture and to the aesthetic wouldn’t go astray.  
11102930,299397958,2018-07-30,121114932,David,"This sparkling clean and well appointed semi detached apartment is really just the place should you be visiting the beautiful and historic wine region of the Barossa Valley in South Australia just under and hour out of Adelaide. It is right in the heart of Tanunda and a short walk from the local shops, cafes and pubs but, importantly Tanunda itself is right in the heart of the Barossa so Marie-France""s place is within easy reach of all the superb sights and highlights of that region especially the historic wineries such as Seppeltsfield and Chateau Tanunda just to name two of the many. Maggie Beer's famous farm shop is in nearby Nuriootpa and there are loads of cafes, restaurants, and charming pubs within easy reach too. For the literary minded I would also recommend a visit to the Raven's Parlour bookstore in Tanunda a short walk from the appartment; it is really well stocked and the staff most knowledgeable about the books they sell including providing a handout with comprehensive reviews of the latesteditions on the shelves. However, whatever reason takes you to the Barossa, Marie-France's is most definitely the place to stay at.. "

11102930,405912200,2019-01-27,237979573,Catherine,Great central location with plenty of space. Note though that you are asked to keep noise to a minimum after 7pm because of elderly neighbours.
11380095,65417065,2016-03-13,3884758,Meredythe,"the house was great.   new, modern and had pretty much everything you needed.     the house was clean,  lots of space if you had a big group.   2 sitting areas, outdoor dining table, modern appliances.  it had clean modern bathrooms.    it was close to the main street of town and about 5 minutes to some of the best wineries.    "
11380095,79618672,2016-06-13,13287226,Vahram,"The house, as well as the hosts' service and responsiveness, exceeded all our expectations. The house is quite large, easily fitting our group of 4 couples. And it was in immaculate condition. Only minutes drive from the best wineries in the region, this place makes a perfect base for a short holiday.
The hosts' responsiveness was also perfect, with communications prior and during our stay. In fact, during our stay the responses to our emails were almost immediate.
A 5 star experience all around."
11380095,101347803,2016-09-12,61424740,Nick,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Little House in Barossa. John and Bianca were very responsive throughout the booking process as well as being available for questions on arrival via text and phone.   We certainly appreciated the welcoming bottle of wine they left for us!

The house itself is contemporary in style with all the convenience of new modern appliances. There is a washer and dryer in the huge laundry room for longer stays.  More than enough room to accommodate our large family event with 3 queen bedrooms and one room with a bunk bed and trundle. Individualized heating for different zones of the house was nice as well. Very comfortable, clean and spacious. 

The location is perfect for getting to wineries and activities inThe Barossa. We are extremely happy we found such a wonderful house. 

Our only suggestions would be the following:  in communications just prior to arrival it would be nice to have been given the house number. That or put a sign on the house saying 'Little House in the Barossa'. 

Secondly. For the amount if money we spent per night, we feel that there should be wifi included in the price particularly in todays connected world. 

Overall we rate this 5 stars and really loved our stay. Thank you John and Bianca "
11380095,106051261,2016-10-03,58400395,Emma,A fantastic little home in the heart of the Barossa. We had a group of 9 girls and there was plenty of room without feeling like we were constantly on top of one another. Everything was very clean and tidy and comfortable for our long weekend stay. John and Bianca were very friendly and accommodating prior to arrival and I would definitely recommend this place to others.
11380095,111580416,2016-10-31,45260233,Simon,Bianca was very helpful. Had a great stay!

The house was very clean, had nice range of kitchen appliances/crockery etc and featured contemporary decor throughout. 

I really appreciated the prompt communication from the hosts. They happily provided a range of suggestions of places to eat whilst visiting the Barossa-and their suggestions did not disappoint! Thanks again Bianca & John. "
11380095,123151685,2016-12-27,1608096,Frances,"The good:
*Great sized house for a family
*Excellent location
*Full kitchen with excellent facilities 
*Beautifully presented

What could be improved
* Pest control a few too many spiders
* Make the outdoor area more inviting.  The bbq was really dirty and we could not use it. 
* Supply garbage bags and dish washing liquid as the ppl who would hire this house would more than likely use the kitchen. 

Overall a great, comfortable home in the heart of the Barossa that is well suited to a family."
11380095,146845519,2017-04-23,61058490,Lisa,Had a great stay. Great communication with owners with great information about the area. Clean and comfortable. Would recommend others to stay during their time trying out the beautiful winery's in the Barrossa area. 
11380095,160180402,2017-06-13,26450016,Tom,"The place is fantastic, very modern, and in a great location for those wishing to visit the (Website hidden by Airbnb) even walking distance to a few of the local wineries.  There was plenty of space both inside and outside for our group of 6 and would highly recommend it to anyone coming this way.

11380095,202355534,2017-10-11,84389648,Maresa,"John and Bianca's home is centrally located to the Barossa's best and offers all modern amenities in a well appointed, clean and comfortable family environment. We loved our locally baked vegemite scrolls and our children loved the games room. We were not home much due to exploring the region but did miss free wifi. A dishwasher, washing machine, Weber Bbq lessened the cooking and cleaning load and with a well equipped kitchen cooking your meals at home saved us a few dollars (although we spent it all on wine). Gracious hosts with great communication and ease of check in and out made our week enjoyable...."

11380095,249838273,2018-04-03,14946936,Phuong,"Great space - bigger than in the photos. The bedrooms are spacious, there are 2 living areas which meant we could all spread out. Getting keys and checking out was a breeze. It's very modern with great facilities, but it is a 30 minute walk into the main strip of shops in Nuriootpa. Would definitely stay here again!"

11380095,320498950,2018-09-09,99845447,Norma,This is a great place to stay if you are touring the Barossa and need somewhere comfortable to lay your head and have breakfast. It is in a new housing estate so perhaps lacks some of the atmosphere of the area but  makes up for that in comfort and cleanliness
11380095,333111493,2018-10-07,85815048,Michael,Great accommodation and location.

11428035,142581591,2017-04-08,5675025,Lisa,The house is in a great location. It's very quiet but only a short walk to the centre of town. It has a lot of lovely period features and a wonderful eating area out the back of the house under grape vines. The only problem was that the back bedroom bed is only a twin and it is uncomfortable. 
11428035,169015350,2017-07-11,20840344,Corinna,"We had a lovely stay in this beautiful house. So close to the main street, but quiet and peaceful. The kitchen was well equiped and there was plenty of wood for the open fire (the central heating was great too, but it Winter getaway and all). Thanks."
11428035,171178260,2017-07-17,98856934,Nikita,"This house is gorgeous and roomy. There is a great large working fireplace in the lounge room which we took great advantage of and there is a pretty cool cellar underground in the kitchen which ties in so perfectly with the fact that you have tons of fantastic wineries at your doorstep. Unfortunately the beds weren't partically comfortable or long enough (I'm 5'10). Overall, great value for money, good spot for a family or a friend's weekend away!"

11857399,105748216,2016-10-02,3820999,Alex,"Robyn was very welcoming, and provided delicious snacks, drinks and food for breakfast, which made our stay wonderful. The bedrooms were cosy and warm, and the main room was huge, with pool table, music and fire (but it was a bit smoky from opening the fire door). The location is easy to find and walking distance to many places in Angaston, and easy to access the rest of the Barossa with car or taxi."
11857399,111029579,2016-10-29,29668692,Andy,Robyn was great to communicate with in the lead up to staying at the Angaston Masonic Lodge. This is a unique building and a comfortable place to stay in the heart of the Barossa.
11857399,112362263,2016-11-05,18946061,Tarnia,"The Masonic Lodge at Angaston was by far my best Air BnB experience yet. With a location as beautiful as this, you would expect a high quality stay, but Robyn truly went above and beyond to make our weekend spectacular. She made recommendations of what to do and where to go, and all the restaurants are within easy walking distance. 
So many little touches made such a big difference to our stay, from the picnic that she organised for us to take on our bike ride around the Barossa, to  stacking the fireplace, providing candles and a bath bomb for the spa, and supplying a beautiful fresh breakfast. You could not find better than this! 10/10"
11857399,117101110,2016-12-04,29670708,Neil,"We booked the Masonic Lodge for a road cycling holiday base in the Barossa and it turned out to be perfect for our needs.  Robyn's communication was truly excellent and responsive.  The lodge was spacious, clean and had a real uniqueness to it.  We were welcomed by a well stocked fridge and a bottle of very good local Shiraz.  The local town of Angaston is quiet, but has good selection of restaurants and shops nearby.  The coffee from Blonds next door was excellent too.  We honestly could not have asked for much more out of this lovely place."
11857399,123812128,2016-12-30,29961153,Alex,This place is amazing! Great little spot in the Barossa. Right in the center of Angaston and easy driving distance to all the great wineries. Robyn was a lovely host. If your looking for a historic stay in the Barossa - this is it! 
11857399,136650240,2017-03-11,116899997,Duy,"Robyn went the extra mile (literally, she drove many extra country miles) to ensure my friends and I made the most of our short stay in the Barossa. From the initial engagement, to itinerary suggestions, locally-sourced food and beverage provisions, and personalised transport, we could not fault the spot-on service or the spacious setup. Would definitely recommend and return for a unique stay."
11857399,144942316,2017-04-16,16460983,Melinda,"Robyn is a wonderful host and the lodge is a great space to stay in. Beautifully decorated and very large we felt very welcome and comfortable. Especially appreciated was the thoughtful yummy supplies that were left for us, after travelling for a while it was so nice to not have to go out for a meal.  Thank you :) "

11857399,159391646,2017-06-11,125295909,Margot,"This B and B is the best of many we have stayed in prior. The building was fascinating history, immaculately presented  and a pleasure to return home to after rambling through the beautiful countryside, classics Barossa towns and amazing wineries. Breakfast  and cheese provisions were very generous however with so many great eateries within a short walk we indulged in the local eateries often. Heating was great and furnished with stylish comfort in every room. . Robyn was very helpful in our planning and offered to drive and collect us to our restaurant for dinner just out of town,  I highly recommend this accomodation in beautiful Angaston. . "
11857399,170591856,2017-07-16,47433622,Chelsea,"What an airbnb to stay at! Everything you need! Robyn was very easy to deal with! She showed us around the lodge. Included was fruit, breakfast and different chesses (thanks Robyn!) Everything you need was here! There was a wood heater that was very toasty! The bedrooms had heating and electric blankets. A pool table. And even make up wipes and hair spray! Very central to everythinf yoy need as well. Would recommend this airbnb to anyone and would stay here again! "
11857399,175847157,2017-07-30,47291939,Kelly,Robyn was an excellent host and the lodge was perfect for our weekend in the barossa. Being mid-winter and with huge spaces to heat we were very pleasantly surprised at how effective the combustion heater was. The beds were comfy and breakfast provisions were phenomenal! 
11857399,181517833,2017-08-13,37025046,Joe,"Easily one of the best Airbnb experiences I've ever had. Robyn was incredibly helpful, quick to respond to questions, and gave us amazing suggestions for things to see/do/taste in the region.

The building and amenities were absolutely stunning. The provided wine, cheese, and breakfast ingredients were wonderful. The wood fire was roaring before our arrival and the rooms were more than comfortable.

We lounged, played pool, had a game of chess, ate, drank, and relaxed, all in the utmost comfort. The region is stunning but the Angaston Masonic Lodge is even better. Our only regret that we didn't stay longer. Could not recommend this highly enough."
11857399,182124558,2017-08-14,109368227,Michelle,"Gorgeous weekend, accommodation was perfect and the extra special touches of detail by Robyn were first class. Thank you Robyn we will certainly be back."

Robyn is a wonderful host and we highly recommend her fantastic Masonic Lodge with welcoming fireplace"
11857399,196691322,2017-09-24,41576718,Zita,"Robyn's place at Angaston is amazing! My husband and I traveled with another couple, and we all had a very comfortable stay in this beautiful converted hall. The luxurious, warm bedrooms are at the front of the property, near the main street, but there was no real traffic noise. The back lounge room is truely enormous, and we loved sitting around the fireplace chatting and laughing after playing some very bad pool games on the pool table. Although we didn't get to meet Robyn, her communication was great; she had many suggestions for things to do in the Barossa region. We really appreciated her ideas and also the delicious breakfast supplies provided. This property is walking distance to cafes, shops and other places to eat. Thanks Robyn!"
11857399,200041430,2017-10-04,40366315,Jane,"We stayed for 10 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Robyn is a great host, very responsive and really wants to make sure you have a good stay.

The place is huge.  Really comfortable.  The water pressure was great for showers.  Robyn and Andrew provide plenty of firewood every day.  When Robyn mentions about providing breakfast provisions... she provides a lot of provisions.  Couldn't ask for more.  She tries to cover all bases - cereal, fruit, yoghurt, bacon, eggs, mushrooms, herbs, halumi, cheese, bread, crumpets... a lot.  Very generous.

there's other nice touches, such as face wipes, hair spray, shaving foam, anything that Robyn can think to provide she does. 

The place is old, it creaks in odd places but it is a historical building.  The beds were very comfortable.

We would definitely stay again."

Everything was special, the place, the location and most of all the hosts. It was a 360° all around amazing experience! The building itself and all the beautiful little touches and interior designs, close to absolute perfection. 
They showed us some amazing wineries and even sent the scarf back that I had forgotten.
We absolutely loved it. If you plan to stay in a central place in the Barossa, this is it :)"

Plentiful local produce for breakfast as well as pre dinner cheeses and after dinner chocolates and fresh fruit. Robyn thought of everything.

11857399,343515393,2018-10-31,10953070,Jen,"This fabulous space, once Angaston's masonic hall built in 1912, was a great respite for us - 2 older couples on a road trip through South Australia!. None of us were on a romantic getaway so the spa and the sheep skin rug  in front of the fire didn't entice us. But the quality linen on the brass beads did beckon us all to a good nights rest after a good hot shower and white fluffy bath towels.. We opted to stay at home and cook that night so shopped in Angaston for local product which was almost unnecessary because the Welcome package was the best I've ever encountered anywhere ever. Our hostess Robyn left us wanting for absolutely nothing. Her attention to detail was beyond the pail. Our  airbnb experience here was the best.."
11857399,344571535,2018-11-04,23437354,Katherine,"This accommodation far exceeded my expectations. The Masonic Lodge was very clean, had fastastic facilities and was in a very convinient location."

It's a unique styled accommodation beautifully presented. Robyn goes out of her way to make your stay enjoyable. A generous amount of locally produced food and wine was left for us to enjoy.

Would recommend to anyone wanting to set up a base for touring the Barossa."
11857399,352165493,2018-11-24,224267326,Joanne,"Robyn is a fantastic host. The breakfast ingredients were of the highest standard, local Barossa bacon, eggs, tomatoes, avocado, asparagus and spinach. Cheeses, salami, biscuits, nuts, wine none of which I was expecting. Robyn also took us for our lunch reservation and picked us up. She was very helpful. We loved the place, the pool table and the fire. Great location in a beautiful town. Would definitely recommend."

Robyn provided us with tips on the local restaurants and offered to prepare to accommodate for our toddler with portacot and high chair. The accommodation itself was amazing and beyond our expectations. We thoroughly enjoyed our night and the amenities provided. The local produce for breakfast was delicious. Would highly recommend. We ourselves intend to rerun for the winter experience.

There is plenty of space and then some and is set up well for whatever you desire- sitting on the couch, listening to music or even getting on the mic for a song. 

We didn’t give ourselves enough time to enjoy the breakfast provisions but were impressed at all the food that had been left for us. 

Great location right on the Main Street on Angaston. We will definitively come back again."

The home was really warm and inviting, Richard was kind enough to have the fire burning before we arrived. The beds were comfortable with electric blankets. The whole house is tastefully decorated and much bigger than we were expecting. I had a friend down from Sydney to give her the Barossa experience and this was the perfect place to stay after a day of wine tasting. I would highly recommend this Airbnb property, I will be back with the rest of the family!!!"
11915715,90561261,2016-08-01,6034036,Guadalupe,"Amazing adorable idyllic cottage. The photos do not do it justice. We were there on a very cold wet winters day and the cottage was warm, cosy and spotlessly clean. It is the type of place you feel at home immediately. The gardens and isolated location were an absolute bonus- without feeling like you were completely alone. Love, love, love "

Relaxing and tasteful, and great AV and food/coffee. If you get time, walk down to the canyon to find kangaroos and birds. Lovely. "
11915715,169832883,2017-07-14,134600775,Yvonne,"The cottage is in a perfect setting.

It's in a lovely setting, very quiet and peaceful, occasionally you can hear the baaing of the sheep.  We enjoyed sitting out in the garden.  Richard responded immediately to our messages.

We in particular appreciated the outstanding breakfast produce that was offered - the best bread ever, amazing eggs, jam, milk and butter! A place to return!"

Lovely views and sunsets, you’ll enjoy seeing and hearing the birds and sheep right outside. Richard was kind enough to show us around the farm, introducing us to his friendly Chickens! You might spot one of the Maremma sheep dogs which guard the chickens or even an owl at dusk. The cottage was very homely and had everything we needed - nice and cool to come back to after a day in the heat. Check out the Barossa farmers market in Angaston - delicious produce! Thanks Richard for having us stay."

The barn is a stunning, unique space full of  original artwork and gorgeous soft furnishings. We did feel as if we had stepped into the pages of a design magazine! At the same time, however, the barn still felt homely and relaxed. Many of the original features such as the cattle trough and exposed brickwork remain. We were welcomed with a selection of provisions including milk, bread and other sweet treats. Kapunda was an excellent base for exploring the Barossa and we couldn't recommend staying at the Barn highly enough. Thanks Jacqueline."

I wouldn't hesitate to visit again. "

There is not one element of the barn that I would change it was a magical stay and the fact it was only a short drive away from the main areas of the barrossa meant we could enjoy the great wineries and come back out of the  hustle bustle and sit by the fire and enjoy some great reds. The support also from Judy and Nicole was magnificent whenever we had a question they were right there to help out. Thanks guys for a wonderful stay!! I would recommend the barn to anyone!"

12192423,114655711,2016-11-19,7726910,Yann,Great place - beautiful garden - spacious bedrooms. A delight.
12192423,123153546,2016-12-27,19466125,Lorna,We had an amazing time at the barn- it is absolutely beautiful and a really unique place to stay. Every room is beautifully decorated with plenty of amenities for everything you need! Jacqueline was also great with communication and gave us tips and advice. 
12192423,124026050,2016-12-31,61036063,Karlene,"We had a brilliant stay at Jacquelines gorgeously renovated barn! Would definitely recommend, we plan on heading back! "
12192423,136640622,2017-03-11,23823989,Tyson,"Such a unique and interesting home...very charming and comfortable.  

Bigger than I anticipated, for two of us the barn was huge.  Great property as well.  

It had everything we needed and the owner was very kind enough to include breakfast items and a bottle of wine.  Just a minute from town which was convenient.  

Two things to point out...
1.  If you are (Website hidden by Airbnb) careful.   I walked away with a few lumps on my head from the beams in the upstairs bedroom/hallway.   
2.  We had a few encounters with spiders...a few dead and a few alive.  We are cuty dwellers so this was an adjustment.      

Highly recommend.  "
12192423,146182064,2017-04-21,41026495,Beau,Absolutely gorgeous location and the perfect place to stay for a trip to wine country. House was immaculate and homely - the perfect place to return to for a few after a day of visiting the local wineries. Jacqueline provided some delicious food and also had great recommendations for the region. Would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the Barossa and would have no problems booking again. 
12192423,159869179,2017-06-11,10029038,David,"Jac' place is lovely, bigger than the photos show, and located in a large private garden. Unfortunately after we checked in late afternoon, we found there was no power to any GPO sockets due to a faulty breaker, so a majority of amenities not available. (E.g. loss of included breakfast supplies as fridge not working, unable to store cold drinks & food supplies we brought with us, unable to charge Phones/iPad, limited kitchen e.g no Fridge, Dishwasher, Kettle, Toaster, Microwave, no WiFi or TV, no Washer or Dryer, limited Wood Heating without fan, no Hair Dryer of Iron etc). This made the stay impractical. We were unable to easily resolve the fault after several calls/msgs & trying to reset the breaker ourselves. Unfortunately Jac was overseas and the local contacts provided were unable to assist. We are not claiming any compensation for first night, but have requested refund of second night as we checked out a day early. I should add that Jac was very apologetic, and we realise it was just very bad luck. "
12192423,173187009,2017-07-23,139976096,Kane,Amazing! Loved it
12192423,182541391,2017-08-15,22787557,Leanne,"Thoroughly enjoyed our time at the Barn. It's  an awesome space with plenty of room. The gardens, the fire, the decor all made for a enjoyable short break from the city. Loved it❤️"
12192423,189491844,2017-09-02,48654348,Steve,Beautiful property. Cosy with the fireplace. Super romantic and cute. Everything you want for a weekend away 
12192423,197565646,2017-09-26,24804986,Holly & Alex,"Gorgeous creative home, which is completely private and makes a good base for following the wine trail. Enjoyed our time here and would stay again. Thanks Jacqueline "
12192423,221824697,2017-12-27,43056339,Michael,"Fantastic base for exploring the Barossa, wonderful & helpful host and one of the nicest places we've stayed at so far."
12192423,224682387,2018-01-04,12630128,Brent,"We found it randomly and it was a long way from where we were intending to stay. Once we saw the description of an old barn turned into a much loved & peaceful Home, we had to take a chance and give it a go.
Jacqueline was excellent on email, all was considered so we didn’t go without but it was the unique and comfortable nature of the place that had us falling in love with it.
A glass of the local, non labeled wine at night as the sky goes pink allows you to drift off to the south of France, with only the many pink Galahs to bring you back to a real Australian experience. 
We even read a few chapters of Jacqueline’s book (and later bought a copy) which explained why the place has so much love invested. 
Almost like an adventurous cubbiehouse, we highly recommend it for a lazy time to experience the Barossa. 
For us, it was our first holiday as a young family and the comforts allowed us to sleep on our 3 month old’s times. It made this special time in our lives very unique and well worth looking a little outside the vanilla box. 
Many thanks,
Brent, Saraya and baby Havana"
12192423,253279264,2018-04-14,98512535,Karena,"Charming cottage. A tiny bit out of the ways but we managed with local taxis etc. Loved loved loved the house, styled beautifully, amazingly actually. Perfect touches like fruit, bread, butter etc. Would love to go back!"
12192423,275425191,2018-06-11,10789235,Elizabeth,"Jacqueline's Barn in the Barossa home was a lovely stay location over the June long weekend for our family of 3 (including our 1 year old, thank you for supplying us with a foldout cot!). It is a beautiful renovated barn with all the modern amenities, spacious yet cosy & we were toasty warm despite it being winter  Good location to come home to after being out & about in the Barossa, would definitely recommend to others! "
12192423,296478768,2018-07-26,71045869,Shelley,"Lots of quirky treasures to discover.  Main bedroom well heated by fireplace! Open spaces including spacious bathroom without screens, curtain or glass - just watch the overspray. Fabulous access to the Barossa and surrounds. Thanks Jacqueline!!"
12192423,301851585,2018-08-05,205779479,Angela,"Beautifully renovated and styled. The fire was very warm, downstairs and upstairs. About 20mins away from Barossa Valleh wineries and restaurants."
12192423,309894241,2018-08-19,191314144,Steven,"It was a very modern yet vintage space. Everything was very clean and well organized. It was very spacious and could easily fit 6 people. There was minimal artificial lighting to allow for the sky lights to fill the house with beautiful natural sun light. Although there was a stunning wood fire there was also 3 heaters spread throughout the home for added warmth. All the amenities were sparkling clean and the whole house was beautifully decorated to compliment the style of the home itself. There was a large book of recommendations for food and fun throughout the Barossa on arrival along with fresh eggs, bread, milk, orange juice, water chilled, tea, coffee and spreads amongst many others. It was a stunning space inside and out. It was so hard to say goodbye to and couldn't flaw a thing. "
12192423,339730740,2018-10-22,14957244,Catherine,"This is a lovely and unique place to stay in the Barossa; you'll feel as though you are in the south of France. And the mix of arty and rustic decor is very attractive.  Spacious bedrooms and very comfortable bed.  It's an easy drive to the wineries and eateries in the area, and the town of Kapunda has its own history and charm. Jacqueline provided some great tips for activities you might not discover on  your own as well as info on places to eat."
12192423,365953220,2019-01-02,23754972,Brett,We had a lovely stay here! Location was great and I would highly recommend it to anyone. On our arrival the fridge was nicely stocked with some brekkie goodies which was highly appreciated.

Fresh herbs from the garden, chocolates, firewood... everything was thought of above and beyond this immaculately appointed home. If (hopefully when) we return to the Barossa we would love to stay here again. "
12394876,191288268,2017-09-07,16757151,Val,"This is a lovely old cottage with lots of comforts. You'll be very, very comfortable here, and really feel you are part of the Barossa history. The owners have provided everything you might need in comforts, kitchen equipment and information."

12394876,346252869,2018-11-08,6742670,Elaine,Thanks for sharing your beautiful cottage with us. It was the perfect location for exploring the Barossa. The cottage is so big but cosy and we didn’t want for anything. We can’t wait to visit again and would recommend Acorn Cottage to anyone who wants a delightful homebase to explore the amazing Barossa Valley.
12394876,401219325,2019-01-13,87305298,Jody,Had a lovely experience at Acorn Cottage.  The little extras awaiting us were a nice touch.  Perfect base for Barossa Wine tasting.

We stayed for two nights as our base in the Barossa and absolutely loved it. Thank to Sue for your love to detail and swiftly answering our questions before and during our visit."

12713083,77511219,2016-06-01,14093798,Rick,"Stuart was flexible with our arrival schedule and communicated well. The space is large featuring a queen bed and essentially a single bed made out of a mattress on a custom frame. House has a washer with hang drying rack, basic amenities for cooking/coffee and a mini fridge. It's a nice house in a very nice neighborhood."
12713083,79474946,2016-06-13,32748007,Selim,"Stuart was easy to communicate with and flexible with check in time. His house was tidy and close to Tununda town (only half an hour walking distance). The bar fridge and microwave were very handy. We found his cat accidentally left on our bed when we arrived so he apologised and provided us with new linen. We really enjoyed our stay at Stuart's although we hardly got to see him, he surely made us feel home and our stay pleasant. "
12713083,79820945,2016-06-14,43741861,Nick,"Nice place in the centre of Barossa.  Cozy neighborhood.  Plenty of space in the spare bedroom, private bathroom.  Also included tea/coffee/microwave.  Easy communication through text message."

12713083,90495653,2016-08-01,7989605,Erica,The stay was all very easy.  The place was more than a bedroom- it felt like a mini-apartment.  Very good value for money. The house is about a 25 minute walk to the main part of town--no trouble on a cycle or in a car. 
12713083,91485566,2016-08-05,12457599,Sandy,Our stay at Barossa Blue was ideal - the location was perfect and the apartment set up ideally for guests - thanks Stuart.

12713083,95728159,2016-08-20,82588517,Amelia,"My partner and I were looking for some r and r away from the city and the blue apartment was perfect for this. The listing says ""private room"" but it more like an apartment. We didn't notice Stuart's presence at all but he was always accessible via phone for any questions we had. We had our bedroom the sitting room and another room if we chose to use that. Stuart also provided a small fridge, toast and kettle which was useful. 
The location was prime near the centre of town and wineries. 
My partner commented that the only way it could have been better was if there was wifi, but the listing does make it very clear there is no wifi.
Overall I really enjoyed my stay here and would recommend to my friends and family. 
Thanks for opening up your home to us Stuart! "

Haha. The garden is well maintained, you receive fresh linen and towels. It was a cheap nights stay and you get half the house to yourself. It was very private and i would recommend anyone needing accomodation in the tanunda area to contact Stuart. "

Limited cooking facilities (microwave and portable oven with hotplates on top) and the only sink is the bathroom basin. Some nice touches from Stuart including ground coffee, plunger and drip filter machine, milo and other condiments. It's a good base from which to explore the Barossa.

12856765,79770738,2016-06-14,15991112,Julie,"We stayed here with 2 other couples over the June long weekend & had such a wonderful relaxing time. 
Robyn & Andrew thought of everything to make our stay as comfortable as possible. 
The house is very clean,  tidy & spacious. After we cooked dinner in the full sized kitchen and bbq out side, we all sat infront of the fire place in the lounge or played boardgames on the big dining room table. 
It's really close to the main street in Angaston so we could walk down and visit the local shops.
The bed were very comfortable, the hosts are very easy to deal with and the scenery is beautiful & relaxing.
Thanks for a great stay Robyn & Andrew"

12856765,82110115,2016-06-26,47530036,Bryony,"We had an excellent trip to the barossa. Robyn was there to show us around when we got there. She had provided us with an amazing cheese and wine spread, beautiful breakfast selection and some local biscuits. It was more then we expected. The house was super comfy with enough space for 7 of us. 
The only thing was the smoke detector kept going off with cooking but there is a BBQ outside.
Definitely recommend this place "
12856765,83813711,2016-07-04,10182874,Liz,"Everything about our stay was just perfect. Couldn't recommend more. Robyn & Andrew went above & beyond to make our stay smooth and comfortable. From coming over to help with the fire, to organising a driver, to providing the most wonderful welcome hamper... We fell in love
With the place & hope to come back one day. Thank you!"
12856765,85165507,2016-07-10,74091539,Allison,"Hi Robyn & Andrew, thanks for a lovely stay. We had a great time in Angaston, drinking wine, relaxing and eating yummy cheeses. We were very impressed with the home we stayed in for 5 nights. The wood fire was extremely cosy and the jaccuzi was a pleasant way to end each cold night. Some lovely extra touches were included in the stay and this was much appreciated.  Highly recommended. Thank you :)"
12856765,87307818,2016-07-19,47594948,Andrew,Robyn was very helpful in communicating about our needs for disabled access.  The provisions were excellent and a huge basket of fruit was provided.  There is plenty of wood for the log fire which ran all the time and kept the house warm and cosy in winter.
12856765,90442036,2016-08-01,72076864,Jessica,"Thanks Robyn for such a lovely retreat.

12856765,93927226,2016-08-14,54937698,Roger,Robyn was a fantastic and friendly host. Great communicator. Location in Angaston was very convenient. Fresh eggs each day from the chooks were delicious. BBQ was great. Backyard fire pit was great. House was warm with great heating options. Beds and rooms were large and comfortable. House was clean and well presented. TV was excellent and lounge chairs very comfortable. Showers hot and water pressure excellent. Bathrooms will need new tiles fairly soon but no big deal. Highly recommend Robyn's place. 
12856765,97512643,2016-08-27,23688343,Ian,"
Wow! On entry to the property you are taken back by the amazing gardens and warmness of this cosy log cabin. Equally amazing is the kind and friendly host, Robyn, whom goes the “extra mile” for ensuring a comfortable, relaxing, trouble free stay. From being greeted with a food platter with wine to assistance with re-starting the log fire, you truly feel the host has considered your every need. 
I booked this place for my wife’s surprise birthday getaway with our three daughters (aged 6 to 12) for two nights. And Yes, in her eyes, I hit a home run :) The only regret was not booking for longer!  The place itself is centrally located in Angaston and fully equipped to accommodate for all your needs, regardless of age. I highly recommend this listing if you are looking to treat yourself to a peaceful and relaxing escape  in one of South Australia's oldest towns. 
Thank-you Robyn & Andrew for opening up your beautiful home! We had the most amazing experience and look forward to returning in the near future. 
The Saumi’s.

12856765,101037814,2016-09-11,9151210,Cortney,"This place could not be more magical. We had six guests stay and there was so much room and the place was absolutely gorgeous. Think the perfect swiss chalet in the middle of the Barossa. Angaston is the perfect location to access the Barossa, and there were little cafes and restaurants close by for the days we didn't want to leave. Honestly - everything about this place is exceptional. "
12856765,104404294,2016-09-26,33006135,David,Robyn was very understanding and helpful despite last minute changes. The  house was perfect for the weekend.
12856765,106783598,2016-10-08,83021631,Lee-Anne,"Robyn was the perfect host. She welcomed my family into her home with a smile. 
My children loved every moment and had the best time exploring the garden and creek. 
Robyn had games and toys for them play with on rainy days. 
The delicious nibbles and wine for the adults were enjoyed and a lovely touch. 
The fire was warm and welcoming on our arrival. 
Robyn went out of her way to help organise meat trays and birthday cakes, which she kindly offered to collect and was waiting for us when we arrived. 
Robyn also assisted us with directions to her property and helped with information on doctors when our daughter became sick. I can not fault her helpfulness. 
The location was perfect, with just a short walk to shops and playgrounds. 
The house was comfortable and warm and well stocked with everything needed for family life. 
I totally recommend this property to anyone wanting a peaceful break away in the Barossa. 
You couldn't ask for a nicer host. "
12856765,106928620,2016-10-08,13769585,Katerina,"Robyn was lovely, she met us upon arrival, showed us around and got the fire going.

12856765,108890554,2016-10-17,36586480,Johanna,"Robyn was an excellent host, couldn't fault her or the house.

The house itself was perfect for our long weekend visit, hot tub, fluffy towels and plenty of games and dvd's. Our kids were particularly delighted with being able to collect eggs from the chickens each morning! We had an excellent stay, would highly recommend!"

Robyn was a fabulous host, everything was there for us, we just had to arrive with the attitude of having a great time! We did just that.  The weather was perfect, the spa was utilised and the grassy patch in the garden was a lovely place to spend Saturday afternoon, indulging in local produce we had collected throughout that day.  Breakfast supplies were ample and attention to detail made our stay homely and comfortable.  Thankyou from all of us ""the bookclub""!"

12856765,112641272,2016-11-06,90184096,Jacqui,"One word - PERFECT!
We were staying in the Barossa for a wedding so this was the perfect location, walking distance to the main street, shopping  cafe's and restaurants.  Very central for all that you may want to see and do around the Barossa.  
Our host Robyn - one word again - PERFECT, fantastic communication from first contact, very flexible with our booking as we weren't sure on how many were staying with us right up until the last few days but Robyn was very accommodating
Our welcome - warm and homely as soon as we walked in the door, with the wine and cheese on the dining table to  farm fresh local produce breakfast ingredients in the fridge - and that was just the beginning - there was nothing for us to think about, right down to the fluffy white bath robes and slippers!!.. 
Great experience, great house and fantastic to share with friends and family, would highly recommend...and already have :) "

Prompt and friendly communication, Robyn was so helpful with any query we had, both about the house and the surrrounds. Perfect accomodation for a group of people, lovely secluded outdoor area with hot tub, and the most delicious brunch in town thanks to Robyns recommendation! We'll definitely be keeping this accomodation in mind for our next trip to the Barossa. Thankyou!!"

12856765,116822012,2016-12-03,4636410,Wendy,"We ( 3 couples)  just spent a lovely week end in the Barossa. 

Angaston by the Winter Creek was a rare find with 4 bedrooms,  3 of which had queen beds and 2 + bathrooms. This in itself is not the norm and is what attracted us to the home as well as its outside area of BBQ, spa and eating area. 

We appreciated Robyn's  effort with the breakfast, nibbles and wine left for us to enjoy and the high quality products for guest's use in bathrooms. 

An enjoyable stay. 
"
12856765,120106249,2016-12-07,41951903,Shayne,Robyn would have to be rated as a fantastic host.  The additional extra touches were greatly appreciated by the whole family.  Robyn greeted us and explained  the house layout and how to use all the facilities.  The cottage was exactly as described and presented immaculately. 
12856765,121771081,2016-12-18,59677313,Sue,"House was quirky, with everything we needed for 5 adults. Local pantry items were tasty. Gardens hard to leave for other destinations. Handy to wineries and good choices for dining. A lovely weekend place."
12856765,122956986,2016-12-26,2530283,Marianne,"We really enjoyed our 4 night stay over Christmas. The house was perfect for our needs - plenty of room for 5 adults, close walking distance to angaston's main street, and very effective air conditioning. The lovely back deck and beautifully maintained grounds were a bonus. We were particularly impressed by how well stocked the kitchen was - so many lovely local treats and loads of quality kitchenware and wine glasses. Check in was a breeze and Robyn went out of her way to assist and make us feel welcome (she even put up a delightful little Christmas tree for us!). A great experience all round. "

Robyn and Andrew were lovely and gave us a tour at check in so we knew all the ins and outs of the property (and spa!) which was a welcoming start to our stay. Robyn even provided some treats and sparklers for our NYE celebrations!
One of the most difficult decisions we faced was choosing our rooms! All are lovely and have their advantages!
The property offers many different areas where you can play sport, suntan, lounge, spa, eat, bbq and in the colder months even sit around a fire pit! Luckily we had three nights to try a bit of everything in the beautiful warm weather.
Even though the property is in the sweet suburbs of Angaston, it feels like a secluded farm retreat. You can walk to the local shops in 5 minutes.
We loved our stay and would love to come back!"
12856765,125269994,2017-01-04,3023184,Lee,"Robyn was a wonderful host, she takes care of every little detail to make sure your stay is perfect.

We would definitely recommend."

12856765,127277693,2017-01-16,99170702,Kim,"Robyn was a terrific hostess. The personal welcome and lovely array of goodies provided, was way beyond expectation and much appreciated. We loved staying at this house! It was cosy, private and walking distance to shops and restaurants - a fantastic and beautiful location. Will definitely recommend this house  to friends and family. 
"
12856765,128330072,2017-01-23,3744179,Jeff,"Wonderful place to stay at. 5 stars for sure. Everything we wanted, it had it plus more. Great location from the vineyards, hot tub was awesome, wish we could have stayed longer. We'll be back. Thanks Robyn"
12856765,128986409,2017-01-28,86665949,Lou,"We had a group come to stay for several nights and had a wonderful time at the house.  The spa was amazing and the hosts provided us with lots of outdoor entertainment (backyard cricket, croquet, etc) on the beautiful green grass outside - which was also nice for sitting back and relaxing! We were welcomed with many good surprises - wine, cheese, fresh fruit, breakfast, delicious biscuits, plus more.  It was a very spacious house fitting our group of 3 couples nicely.  Robyn was very accommodating to our needs and was able to help us organise some meat from the local butchers (delicious!) as well as provide us with information regarding transport during our stay.  We would highly recommend!! "
12856765,131615955,2017-02-12,415780,Helen,"This was my best AirBnB experience ever, and I've stayed in homes all over the world. The house was excellent, even better than in the photos, and Robyn was an incredibly thoughtful host- the snacks and treats were a lovely surprise, and one we were very grateful for after a long drive! A lovely area, and the house is a short walk to the the little high street with a couple of cafes, pubs, a wine bar and restaurant, not to mention the excellent cheese shop that is well worth a visit. If I could give six stars I would. "
12856765,133991137,2017-02-25,20921553,Sarah,"This place is amazing. Robyn is so friendly, helpful and fantastic to deal with. The house is big and a great space for entertaining. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
12856765,135890764,2017-03-06,73469652,Daniela,Robyn was so generous and helpful! It was our wedding and the bridal party stayed in the house. Robyn even helped us source beauticians! On arrival the fridge was full and the house was just perfect! Will absolutely recommend this beautiful home to everyone!
12856765,137349647,2017-03-14,98720636,Fay,This property is close to the main street of beautiful Angaston.  It is spacious.  The children enjoyed the spa very much.  The breakfast supplies were amazing.  
12856765,139140965,2017-03-23,114284413,Grant,"Angaston on the Winter Creek is a wonderful, comfortable place to stay, and Robyn is a generous and gracious host. We were struck by how well appointed the house was, and how much was available in the way of housewares, linen and towels, and so on. Also, Robyn was very generous with the breakfast provisions and other pantry items she left. She is going to be a hard act to follow."
12856765,139546239,2017-03-25,30569411,Marika,"We were blown away by the beautiful log-cabin style house and stunning garden and surrounds. Although two streets away from the Main Street in Angaston, the location was very quiet. Angaston was the only interesting town in the Barossa this weekend--all the others closed their shops at 12 noon. The house was roomy and comfortable--with 4 double beds in 4 bedrooms--perfect for groups of friends. There are only two rooms that are next to each other, the others are spaced out around the house. There is a huge 8 person spa with TV and dining table under the private veranda out the back. Inside there is a kitchen w a generous amount of provisions for breakfast and other treats!! There is a Nescafé coffee pod machine and gas stove and all the cooking utensils you could need to cook a dinner party! There is a huge dinner table for 10 and you can relax in the lounge room later with massive TV and dvds. We just loved it there and it was a hit with our guests too. Just book it you'll love it!!"
12856765,142577049,2017-04-08,19542573,Nicole,"Where to begin!! Robyn and Andrew's house is perfect for a group of friends looking to enjoy the Barossa from a beautiful and comfortable base. The house is just a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston and a 20 minute drive to most of the Barossa wineries, but is in a quiet neighbourhood on a large block.

The house is decked out with everything you could possible need. The linens are lovely, it is spotlessly clean and there are plenty of things to do in the house - games, cricket, a spa, sound system and a huge TV (great for footy). There is also an open fire which would be amazing in winter (it was way too hot when we were there).

Robyn really is the hostess with the most! She left the fridge full of delicious Barossa goodies including wine, cheese, eggs, bacon, fresh bread, tim tams, fruit, vegetables and even Maggie Beer icecreams! We had a delightful breakfast in the garden alongside the creek one morning. Robyn also offered to help out wiht transport (which in a wine region is a huge plus).

We will definitely be back. Robyn's place was great value, accurately described and the hospitality was second to none.

Angaston is a great base for the Barossa - it's small and quaint but has everything you need. We ate at the Wine Bar in town which was excellent and visited the farmers market on Saturday morning - amazing. 

Thank you so much Robyn and Andrew! We will see you again. Kind Regards, Nicole, Noel, Josie, Ben, Martine and Dave.
"
12856765,143650537,2017-04-12,116136210,Taryn,"We had a great stay here. Leading up to our holiday, Robyn went above and beyond to provide up with email information about the house and the local area. Check in was easy and Robyn even made the effort to come by and show us around the house and how everything worked (e.g. The awesome spa!). The house had more than enough space for our group, with a large kitchen for cooking as well as huge indoor and outdoor dining tables. Robyn provided loads of local foodie treats, like smoked bacon from the local butcher and wine from a local vineyard. We would definitely return for another holiday."
12856765,144942174,2017-04-16,24207378,Natalie,"Robyn's place is AMAZING. We had two couples stay there but you could easily accomodate another four people / two couples in the house as there's a lot of space both inside and out. Robyn has thought of everything in this place, from a lovely welcome snack, to outside dining and fire pit, games corner, awesome home theatre, even a karaoke machine! There's a great kitchen if you love to cook as it has all the essentials and more. It is the perfect house for a fun relaxing getaway but also close enough to walk into town if you feel like venturing out. We based ourselves there for four days and it was a nice easy drive to a whole range of amazing wineries. The house is perfect, I would highly recommend it, and it's made even better by Robyn's helpfulness and thoughtfulness. We will definitely be back! "
12856765,145956050,2017-04-20,7062663,Deborah,Great house for a family or group of people! Central location for the Barossa and close to the shops in the lovely town of Angaston. Robyn left us little surprises and I would highly recommend this property to anyone!
12856765,147083747,2017-04-24,43310454,Mark,A lovely place to stay and a great host. Robyn is extremely helpful and ensures that all your needs are met. Thanks Robyn!
12856765,148484026,2017-04-30,13844206,Mary,"An absolutely perfect spot to enjoy both the Barossa wineries, but also enjoy the lovely cafes & bistros of Angaston...followed by a dip in the hot tub! A marvellous weekend!"
12856765,149993774,2017-05-06,120676924,Katrina,Thankful for a beautiful stay. Lovely  quiet weekend away with the girls. The spa was great and we loved all the treats. 
12856765,151670233,2017-05-13,72429626,Anthony,"Angaston by Winter Creek is exactly as described. It is super spacious, yet very cosy, especially with the combustion heater. Robyn met us at the house and gave us suggestions about where to go and what to do. The house was very clean and the fridge was stocked with local produce. It is also in the perfect location, just behind the main street of Angaston. We would definitely be back.  Thanks Robyn."
12856765,152518177,2017-05-17,124337940,Yi,"Clean, spacious, warm, cosy, well equipped house with unique structure. Enthusiastic, detailed host. She even prepared special bath gel and sweets for my son! Thanks Robyn, this is one of the best stay I have ever had!"
12856765,155817381,2017-05-28,7044380,Lauren,Robyn's house is wonderful. She really has thought of everything and it was just what we needed for a weekend away. I would recommend this house to my friends and family and would love to stay here again next time I'm visiting the Barossa. 
12856765,157416383,2017-06-03,125494882,Kylie,"Robyn is a terrific hostess and has a gorgeous place! I celebrated my 30th birthday in the Barossa with 6 friends at the beginning of winter and her cabin-style home was perfect. 

-There were local treats left in the fridge, freezer and kitchen in case anyone needs a snack after their journey or before stepping out for groceries/dining locally. 
-The property was adequately heated (it was the beginning of winter) but if you are still cold there were robe options, throw blankets and slippers. 
-The main street is just one block over and is a very short walk. 
-It easily fit 7 people without feeling crowded at all. 
-The grounds are gorgeous and there are outdoor dining options (we had our final breakfast near the hen house on the outside tables in the sun, it was amazing). 
-If anything is on in town or the surrounding towns, Robyn is very considerate and will let you know in case you'd like to add it to your itinerary.
-It sounds silly but I was worried if there'd be enough towels for the spa, but I needn't have! There were plenty of big beach towels for all of us and still plenty of bathroom towels to shower with. 

Thank you for allowing us to have an absolutely wonderful experience in your airBnB home! I cannot recommend it enough!
"
12856765,159860511,2017-06-11,47373117,Wendy,Thank you for allowing us to stay at such a wonderful home. The food and goodies were a pleasant surprise. 
12856765,173210315,2017-07-23,77215790,Martine,"Second visit was as perfect as the first.  The special little touches and Robyn and Andrew's service and warmth makes all the difference.   Everything you need is there.  Once you've been there, nothing else will do.  Highly recommended."
12856765,179196294,2017-08-07,117876308,Dåni,"This place is such a beautiful, inviting, warm place to stay we couldn't fault it. Such a lovely earthy feel, with wonderful hosts who just went above an beyond what is needed. Leaving delicious fine cheese platter, lovely breakfasts and such great communication. I would love to live there it is a must for cabin lovers with a beautiful surrounding. Very spacious and comfortable room for families. Thank you and we highly recommend to anyone looking to hire this place go for it! "
12856765,182517012,2017-08-14,38880676,Chiara,"We had 4 couples stay at Robyn's house for 3 nights and we couldn't fault the experience. Robyn made check in very easy and walked us through the house. She stocked the fridge with amazing local produce for us to have breakfast cook ups including fresh eggs from her chooks in the backyard. The house has a lovely outdoor spa and she supplied 8 fluffy robes to make the experience feel even more luxurious. Robyn also supplied body wash, shampoos and all the little necessities in case you forgot to pack! The fire pit in the backyard can be used for $25 extra per night and is well worth it! The house is located a short walk from angaston town and this was a perfect location to access the Barossa wineries each day! Overall an absolutely wonderful stay that I would recommend to anyone!"
12856765,185128107,2017-08-21,118647580,Denise,"Robyn greeted us when we arrived, and provided us with a thorough overview of the houses amenities, and even started a fire for us.  The cottage was the perfect mix of rustic with all the modern conveniences of life, making this place a perfect place to stay while exploring Barossa.  We really enjoyed the home and the surroundings!!"
12856765,203302797,2017-10-14,43848463,Jamie,Robyn's place is incredible. Situated perfectly for daily Barossa trips and also equipped with a hot tub tv and bbq for those comfy nights in! Any small issues we had were dealt with quickly and we can't thank Robyn enough for her help during our stay. Highly highly recommended.
12856765,207250464,2017-10-28,79770599,Amy,"This house has everything the family travelers need and more! We visited with a 1 and a 3 year old and they loved the beautiful yard and daily trips to the chook pen. The house is clean, comfortable and well stocked with the essentials including a great selection of cheese, and local produce and a delicious breakfast platter. Robyn has thought of everything and provided clean and safe children's equipment and linen. A great location in the heart of Angaston in easy walking distance to the amenities and restaurants. Look no further, you've found your B'N'B!!"
12856765,209970757,2017-11-06,16224493,Allan,Robyns place was simply fantastic. It was the ideal place to base our group get together in the Barossa Valley. The accomodation is as described in the pictures. All communication with Robyn was easy and she was quick to respond. Check in was simple.  We all agreed that we should return if ever back in the region. Would definately recommend. Allan
12856765,215295590,2017-11-28,52906123,Monique,Robyn went above andbeyond to make our stay enjoyable.  in each room there were small additions and special touches that made us feel at home and allowed us to relax and enjoy our stay.  By far the best Airbnb my family has been to thus far
12856765,216466668,2017-12-04,53669629,Paul,"Robyn certainly went out of her way to accommodate us. Lots of yummy food, a bottle of wine, flowers and nice soaps etc. were appreciated.  An upstairs bathroom would be good, but plenty of room and the spa was nice. Cheers."

Superb hospitality including wine, cheeses and breakfast items. Robyn made sure we had everything we needed for our stay, including accomodating our very young children (e.g: high chair etc).  Her tips for enjoying the area were really helpful too.  Fabulous!"
12856765,222131186,2017-12-29,132396837,Giselle,"Communication was excellent and especially the extra touches of fresh flowers,  breakfast provisions including fresh eggs, cheese platter and special ice cream treats - all very much appreciated.  Also having an Expresso coffee machine was great and saved us searching for that ""elusive great coffee"" in the area.  Robyn also offered to arrange fresh seafood for us for the festive season which was another unexpected gesture.  Would love to visit again in Winter. for that really warm and cozy experience.    Giselle"
12856765,223157955,2017-12-31,39282635,Elizabeth,"Good clean accommodation and excellent breakfast provisions plus extras such as a bottle of wine.  Lovely table setting outside and great lawn area.  Angaston was a bit quiet on New Year's Eve, not that it worried us."

12856765,232885129,2018-02-06,18143813,Shauna,Really nice and quirky cabin. Looks like a lovely place for a couple families... big yard that we didn’t use! Appreciated the wine & cheese on arrival.

12856765,249221952,2018-04-01,51981833,Brayds,"Robyn was extremely helpful and communicated well throughout our stay. Her house is beautifully furnished and comfortable, and was topped by Robyn’s generous hamper left in the fridge along with some delicious port! Excellent stay, highly recommended!"
12856765,253631326,2018-04-15,82604651,Kelly,Robyn was a lovely easy going person to communicate with and helped us in anyway she could. The breakfast and cheese platter were amazing and the BBQ dinner (optional extra) was superb and would recommend to take up the offer for a little extra money was totally worth it. Very relaxing place to stay. We loved every minute of it. Thank you again Robyn
12856765,258243833,2018-04-29,173899013,Joanne,Great location and house has a lovely homely feel . Robyn is an excellent host. Nothing is too much trouble.

Natasha "
12856765,274714530,2018-06-10,3021297,Martin,"Absolutely fabulous, we had 3 generations sharing this wonderful home. Beautiful inside and out,  Robyn welcomed us with a great spread of local produce so no need to do any shopping the night we arrived. The only problem was we werent there long to really settle in and just enjoy the place."
12856765,280706442,2018-06-24,182999905,Genevieve,"This was a lovely place to stay for my friends and my long weekend in the Barossa Valley.  There were lots of nice touches to the property and Robyn was a great host.
My friends and I loved the spa, fireplace and overall ambience of the house and garden."
12856765,298887454,2018-07-30,40362603,Sarah,Robyn was so helpful and the place had everything we needed and more. My kids and husband suffer badly from asthma and this house was spotlessly clean and they had no problems breathing at all! We got the bbq pack and it was absolutely fantastic fresh and tasty food! Everything was easy! We’d definitely stay here again! 
12856765,302672254,2018-08-06,6921124,Richard And Dianne,"We were a group of four ladies spending a long weekend in the Barossa.  We were so pleased we chose Robyn's place to stay.  We each had our own comfortable room with electric blankets, very comfortable bed and pillows.  The living area was warm and cosy and there was plenty of wood supplied for the fireplace.
Robyn was extremely generous with the provisions supplied and the kitchen had all the appliances you would need.  As well, there were plenty of glasses, plates, cutlery etc.  We spent our first night sampling the bottle of very nice Shiraz left for our enjoyment.  The gardens and grounds of Robyn's house are beautiful and would imagine they would be more so in the Spring and Summer months.
We did not use the spa or bbq so can't comment on those, but the area they are in is very nice indeed and would be great to enjoy on not such a cold weekend.
The Barossa Farmer's Market on Saturday morning is highly recommended.  We also had wonderful meals at Vintners, Angaston and 1918 in Tanunda.
I would wholeheartedly recommend Robyn's house for your stay in the Barossa.  
Do note however, that there is no early check in available unless you pay for an extra day in advance."
12856765,305770648,2018-08-12,206391076,Morgan,"Robyn's place was beautifully appointed with lots of thoughtful touches. She went above and beyond as a host by meeting us on arrival to show us around  and by driving us to our dinner reservation at Hentley Farm.
Particularly special features included the fireplace, spa, fresh local produce for breakfast and the chooks!"
12856765,309837391,2018-08-19,15740583,Andrew,Our stay was lovely. Robyn was really accommodating and the house was wonderfully cosy and perfect for what we were after. The house had everything it said it would and is a great location to Tanunda.

12856765,313707295,2018-08-26,3591001,Kristy,"A fantastic stay in Angaston. This house had everything. 4 comfortable rooms, multiple bathrooms, a great kitchen and dining table for big meals and it was walking distance to the shops and pub.
The hot tub was HOT but very relaxing and the karaoke machine certainly got a workout. What a fantastic stay we had with a few other couples. Thank you."
12856765,317917675,2018-09-03,56036103,Cimlie,"A fabulous place to stay if you want to see the Barossa, perfect host, lovely thoughtful touches. We loved the girls’ eggs & the food was amazing."

We can’t thank them enough for all the help with our wedding logistics and for helping us organising a lovely family picnic the day after the wedding. Most importantly, they made us feel at home. We had the best time at their place, it’s a beautiful house, sparkling clean and equiped with all the required items that you could possibly need. We travelled with my two months old niece and Robyn & Andrew made sure she had all that she needed. We will definitely stay there again!"
12856765,331155420,2018-10-01,119705637,Sharona,An amazing property. The second time now that I have stayed there. Robyn has thought of every little detail and supplies the house with great local produces. Very relaxing enjoying a wine in the spa or by the wooden fire. The photos really do not do the house justice. An amazing stay and Robyn is so helpful with suggestions. Will be booking again forsure.

This was our return  girls trip for the second year ..very relaxing  The side garden facing the creek was pure bliss...we all sat out there and became totally “zen” "
12856765,356033255,2018-12-06,70055260,Eleanor,"What an incredible place.

12856765,400400402,2019-01-12,52988759,Rachael,"Lovely home, great location a short walk into town.  Robyn goes above and beyond to assist her guests, our fridge was stocked to the brim.  I would highly recommend staying here, it’s like having your own little oasis."
12856765,407655549,2019-02-02,110574999,Crystal,"This place is spectacular. There were little touches everywhere that were great, like shampoo, soap, makeup remover in the main bathroom. The spa was fantastic and it was a bit too warm to have a fire but the fire pit was all set up for us anyways. We had a great time using the karaoke machine and it was so nice to be able to cook up a breakfast with the fully stocked fridge provided. The beds were so comfortable as well. Robyn even pointed us in the right direction for restaurants etc and kept communication with us the entire time in case we needed something. We will be back to the Barossa and will definitely book this home again."
12856765,415964642,2019-02-24,52979642,Rachel,"Our stay here was wonderful! The hospitality provided by Robyn & Andrew was wonderful. Made for a great weekend in the Barossa!

12856765,422395817,2019-03-11,34604502,Jessica,"Thank you Robyn for providing such a gorgeous property. Extremely spacious, very relaxing surroundings and conveniently close to the town centre (without feeling like it). All four of us who stayed for our girls weekend found the beds to be comfortable and the linen immaculately clean. The food that was left for us was amazing, we made up a wonderful platter to enjoy on the back deck. All in all we had a fantastic time and definitely recommend!!!"
12856765,433658412,2019-04-07,77076464,Kate,"Really well equipped place, had everything you could possibly need and plenty more. Very accommodating host, great location and value for money with all the extras provided. Really enjoyed our stay."
12906285,136634345,2017-03-11,23493921,Coral,Rebekah and Ed's place was gorgeous. Simple yet stylish and as noted in the description based on the 1950's era. Very clean with all the things we required for our stay. Beck was easy to contact and her communication was very prompt. The main Street of Angaston was less than ten minutes walk and we enjoyed trying out some of the suggestions for dining including Roaring 40's pizza and Vintners Inn. Bed was brand new and very comfortable. Bathroom had just recently been renovated and was spotless. Would recommend this place for anyone visiting the Barossa.
12906285,138470739,2017-03-19,59665769,Greta,"This is a beautiful house in a quiet neighbourhood of the Barossa valley. The house is a good size for 2-4 guests with vintage furniture to complete the look. Rebekah was very helpful and quick to respond and was happy to leave us to our own devices. With a car it's very easy to get around the area but we recommend booking a tour if you want to indulge in the wine. We went for a fantastic dinner at Vintners Bar and Grill, just outside of Angaston. 
The house is a short walk into  town, where you will find a couple of pubs, cafes, a wine bar and food store. "
12906285,139525413,2017-03-25,116740540,Toni,"What a delightfully gorgeous 50's house - so full of charm. Rebekah has prepared the house perfectly for guests - the style, cleanliness, little extras, comfortable beds and beautifully renovated bathroom and laundry are a delight.  We highly recommend it for anyone travelling in the region - close to the main street of Angaston and a few short kilometres from Tununda. Rebekah's hospitality was second to none. Thank you so much for sharing your home with us."
12906285,143664608,2017-04-12,53870696,Jacqui,"Rebekah is a fabulous host. Quick to respond when you need her. House is quiet and cosy. Heaps of space inside with lots of cute little outdoor spaces in the garden. Large bedrooms with extremely comfy beds. Very practical and clean kitchen, bathroom and laundry. Lovely walk into town.

It's a short walk to the main street of Angaston with a good choice of restaurants and shops. Angaston is a pretty town and a great spot base a Barossa visit."
12906285,149541649,2017-05-04,35761139,Kay,It's like stepping back into the 50's brought back many childhood memories. Good value for money

Lots of space inside and out with a lovely big backyard full of beautiful roses. The house was in walking distance to Angaston town centre and a good area to stay to visit wineries in the region. Would definitely stay again!
12906285,208549845,2017-11-02,391966,Barbara,"Easy access to this property is so convenient and the yard is beautiful to sit and enjoy a glass of wine. Everything was immaculate. We made use of the washing machine and hung our clothes to dry, greatly appreciated after traveling for two weeks.  We spent three days at Rebekah’s and found it very central for exploring the Barossa Valley. Fantatic time, and if we are ever back this way would certainly stay here again"

This place has Everything travellers need and more.
Lots of extra touches.
Very comfortable beds with quality bed linen and towels.
The garden has been transformed a lovely area to sit and have a glass of wine which Rebekah provides.
It’s in a quiet residential area but easy access to shops and wineries.
Great restaurants within easy driving or some walking distance.
Keep up the great standard us travellers really enjoy finding such comfortable places.
We will be back."
12906285,229491875,2018-01-24,116740540,Toni,"Our stay in this retro cottage was perfect. It was well appointed with everything that we needed for a comfortable stay; especially the beds! The house is a short stroll from the main street of Angaston and in the heart of the wineries. The kitchen had everything we needed for self-catering but we took the opportunity to enjoyed dinner at Vintners one night as well. Handy wifi and laundry facilities (with powder!). There are plenty of cafes in walking distance with great coffee. 

The attention to detail was incredible. From the authentic 1950’s décor, through to the modern luxuries (love that they give you TWO kinds of pillow!) this place is a joy to stay in. Did I also mention there’s wine provided for you, that’s made personally by the winemaker owner?? Can’t wait to come back for a longer holiday!”

Can't recommend enough.

Fantastic centrally-located tranquil home base for touring into the Barossa. And the cherry on top: Rebecca was a top notch host

12906285,266962397,2018-05-21,706416,Kevin,"We stayed for 3 nights at Rebekah’s Airbnb and enjoyed our stay! It's great that she restored a classic/retro-style home and it was much more spacious than we anticipated. It had all the amenities one would hope for in an Airbnb, and she was kind enough to leave us some local welcome items (fresh bread, jam, milk, wine, etc.). These little touches improve the check-in experience, so it's great she adds that extra touch. The home is spacious, the location is central (close to what you'd want to explore in Barossa Valley), and Rebekah's communication was fantastic. Overall, a great experience and I'd recommend her place for anyone that needs a centrally-located home in the Barossa Valley.  Thanks!"
12906285,280700009,2018-06-24,28892365,Paola,Beautiful house and amazing hosts. The details and retro decor from the house are great. Thanks Rebekah for your assistance with our late check-in and for your hospitality. We would definitely stay again.

The Continental breakfast provisions and complimentary wine made life easy within a fully stocked kitchen with any pan or utensil you could possibly need. The linens were good quality, especially the quilt, and the bed is best for those who prefer a firm mattress. It is in a quiet neighbourhood close to all the delights of the Barossa. Netflix on the big TV was a treat to wind down after being out and about. Rebecca communicated clearly and quickly and checked in during our stay that we had everything we needed. I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a stay at Rebecca’s place!"

If you should want to venture out there are many good restaurants in the (Website hidden by Airbnb) of our favourites is Casa Carboni.

12906285,418752055,2019-03-03,163725713,Murray,"This charming house on a quiet street in Angaston  provided the perfect accommodation for our weekend in the Barossa. 
Each room was well appointed within the theme of period 1950’s, but of course the modern conveniences there to remind you we are in the 21st century. 
The bathroom was large and modern and offered all the necessary amenities. Beds were comfy and pillows cloud-like. 
Although we didn’t make it out there for longer than a two-minute arrival sticky-beak, the backyard has massive potential if staying for longer - with BBQ area and beautiful garden beds full of life (the sunflowers were blooming when we were there )
It is a short, pleasant downhill walk through the recreation grounds to the Main Street - so despite feeling like you’re on the outskirts, the property is really well situated to everything. 
Beck was supreme with her advice and communication - the ideal host! 
If we make it back to Angaston, we’d love to retro-it-up again."

The house itself has plenty of room, open plan living, great backyard with veg patch and chooks - all make for a refreshing home away from home. They provided all cooking utensils and condiments making for stress free dinners. The location was perfect for a Barossa Adventure - Murray Street Vines is a stunning cellar door only a short walk away. Thanks again for an awesome stay! "

For either a couple, group or Family. The location is amazing! 

A group of us went up to Barossa Valley to play a Basketball tournament over the long weekend, but because we were so close to everything we got some time in for a wine tasting and a couple of golf games. 

Karin replies very quickly and they live just down the road incase anything does go wrong. However they leave you to your privacy and simply check in through text or AirBNB if you need anything. So if you like your privacy for your trip, or you like to interact with your host in person, you can choose your way. 

Thanks Karin! We will be back again!"

13480951,124011127,2016-12-31,79971011,Luke,"The best way to describe this place is ""Perfect"", such a great location with stunning views. Everything is within walking distance, ample parking. Check in was a breeze, inside was spot on. Had an amazing time and hope I can get back there."

13480951,175873486,2017-07-30,138228527,Brigida,The place is nice and quiet but in a great handy location. It has everything you need including a bread maker and a fire place. We got in at night so the host rang to find out when we would be arriving and because it was at night he went around and turned the lights and heater on. There was also a lovely bottle of wine and cheese and biscuits waiting for us too. The key lock box is very difficult to open. Apart from that everything else was excellent. I would definitely stay there again.
13480951,222480560,2017-12-30,157072644,Tania,Excellent location and beautifully appointed.
13480951,338934064,2018-10-20,20422247,Stewart,Great house within walking distance of town
13480951,349567914,2018-11-17,205768686,Tammy,Fantastic location! Walking distance to so many local attractions. Loved that the place was stocked with basic supplies for cooking! Beds very comfortable and bath towels were so nice! We loved it!
13480951,352189835,2018-11-25,13470527,Alicia,"What a wonderful weekend away! Close to the main street, useful kitchen with enough things to make bacon and eggs for breakfast and a cheese board in the afternoon, comfy beds and pillows, clean bathrooms and hot showers and just enough space in the open plan kitchen dining for 6 people. Would highly recommend for 3 couples for a weekend away."
13770749,178598029,2017-08-06,45124734,Tamara,"My family and I loved staying here. The home is absolutely enormous which was great as we all had our own space to relax at the end of a long day. The grounds are beautiful and if it wasn't raining during our stay it would have been wonderful to sit by the lake or outside on a rocking chair with some wine. There were so many inclusions that we weren't expecting, cheese platter arrival drinks, wine, a roaring fire to greet us! Don't hesitate, just book. The best place in the Barossa I have visited!!! We'll be back."
13770749,205304375,2017-10-21,92349660,Renee,"We absolutely loved our stay at Grand Cru Estate. The owners Roz and Pete made our stay so enjoyable with attention to detail from the freshly cut flowers to the ready prepared fire places. The bath robes provided were so soft and beds and pillows were fabulous! We were pleasantly surprised with bottles of wine as gifts including one of our favourites 'Rozzie's Giggle Juice' produced by the owners. On both nights of our stay we enjoyed delicious wood fired pizzas made on site in the restaurant (make sure you have the brownie pizza yum!). To top it all off the beautiful period home was surrounded by picturesque grounds including a luscious garden, veggie patch and lake. We also could not get enough of the cutest farm animals wondering the grounds and the famous Wine dogs, who were just adorable. Grand Cru Estate was the icing on the cake to an amazing Barossa Vally stay. Thank you so much Roz and Peter for having us, we will be sure to see you again! 

"
13770749,249299380,2018-04-02,6143448,Dannika,"My fiancé and I had an absolutely wonderful stay at the Grand Cru Estate homestead. Pete and Roz are amazing hosts and will go out of their way to accomodate your every request and ensure you have a great stay. The accomodation is spacious, comfortable and well equipped for an extended visit, with lots of thoughtful  touches that make it feel like a home away from home (if you had a stunning country estate!). The gardens and the property itself are magnificent and a joy to explore. Overall we had a fantastic experience and definitely recommend this as a base to explore the greater Eden Valley region!"
13770749,319619469,2018-09-07,24852300,Rachael,Absolutely lovely. Can't wait to return.
13770749,333119387,2018-10-07,50666762,Nicole,"If you are looking for a little piece of paradise located in the Barossa Valley you must stay here. The gorgeous homestead was beautifully appointed with some many things including soft snuggly dressing gowns, 2 fireplaces stocked with firewood, L’Occitane products for the bathrooms and provisions for a home cooked breakfast.  Each morning we would be welcomed by Maddie, Maisie and Malt the golden retrievers that were exceptionally well behaved and adorable.  There were so many places to relax and soak up the atmosphere, that it was hard to leave to explore and enjoy the Barossa.  We managed to do both and we throughly recommend stay here. Looking forward to bring some friends  back to share the experience with."
13770749,412961726,2019-02-16,19895857,Dan,"I can thoroughly recommend Roz’s place. Roz was a very generous and thoughtful host - we arrived to wine in the fridge, a large cheeseboard and very full provisions for breakfast, including bacon, eggs, mushrooms, yoghurt and cereals.

The property is beautiful and the bedrooms were very comfortable. Roz and her husband were very hospitable.

Many thanks again Roz for providing a great weekend!"
13835460,105414583,2016-10-01,89772222,Giorgina,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Winemakers. A beautiful, well equipped and centrally located property. Wyndham and Patricia were wonderful hosts, and made sure we felt welcome and comfortable. We'd definitely stay here again."
13835460,109644889,2016-10-22,15206784,Heidi,"We had a lovely stay at The Winemakers House. The house is spacious with beautiful gardens and pool, the house is beautifully decorated and perfectly located to explore Tanunda and the surrounding vineyards of the Barossa Valley. "
13835460,111479019,2016-10-31,53991749,Quentin,"The Winemakers of Tununda was superbly fitted out with gorgeous beds and all the creature comforts that one needs.
The photos don't really do it justice, as every detail couldn't be covered.
The location, was perfect, so close to everything."
13835460,113805681,2016-11-13,8700599,Georgia,"We had such a lovely time in the Barossa, the house was just perfect for our girls weekend away. We picked up the keys from their vinyard and started with a delicious glass of wine. Cannot wait to go back - highly recommended!! "
13835460,114630649,2016-11-19,25087526,Tricia,"Lovely accommodation in a great location, thoroughly enjoyed relaxing outside by the pool and in the courtyard. Thank you!"
13835460,116576957,2016-12-01,43044174,Christopher,"Great spot in Tanunda, thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Loved the pool!"
13835460,121771967,2016-12-18,24135884,Kasia,"The winemaker's retreat exceeded our expectations.  Centrally located for convenience, yet private and secluded enough for total relaxation.  Somedays it was a little hard to tear ourselves away to take advantage of all that the Barossa has to offer! Wyndham and Patricia were warm, charming and helpful and we can't wait to come back."
13835460,123561909,2016-12-29,91039551,Robyn,"Shame that our visit was tainted from the start by the distance required to travel to pick up the key, at the end of our long day's drive. Then being faced with the requirement to give a credit card to cover a long and inadequately defined list such as ""excessive cleaning"" put a sour taste in our mouths. Arriving in the house to find signs such as No Smoking in the middle of the lounge and ""No Spitting"" over the pool, even offended my 27 yo son! Add to this, the no shoes in house sign and you begin to get the idea. 
Even before arriving, we were told that no-one else could visit the house and a camera was in place to see who entered the property!
It is a lovely, if quirky house, with all that you need for a pleasant visit, but unfortunately the lingering sensation is of not being trusted or welcome. Not what I expect from Airbnb."
13835460,125076308,2017-01-03,13250947,Andrew,"We had a great few days at Wyndham and Patricia's home. We loved the pool and the easy access to the Barossa's highlights. The home is decorated in a delightful style, and well equipped for a very comfortable stay. It was nice to have some breakfast staples when we arrived and the opportunity to purchase some wines made by the host. Loved our stay! "
13835460,126847429,2017-01-14,7310032,Margaret,"Thank you Wyndham for our wonderful holiday at your beautiful place in Tanunda - perfect location to access all the lovely wineries in the Barossa. Loved the ambience of your facility. The pool was very inviting, lucky to have great weather. Hope to return soon"
13835460,127264098,2017-01-16,107843535,Lorise,"This was the perfect place to stay. We loved everything about this beautiful house - it was like being at a luxury resort, especially with the wonderful pool, stunning gardens and impeccable décor. It was a fantastic place to unwind after exploring the Barossa Valley. Wyndham was great to deal with and we appreciated the care he took to ensure our stay was perfect. We will be back! "
13835460,128999550,2017-01-28,21861378,Bridgette,"Wyndham was the perfect host. He was the best communicator, and so flexible. Also he was so inviting and welcoming, it really did make our trip to the Barossa lovely.. to know we could give him a call made it just that bit nicer.
The home was BEAUTIFUL. Everything we could have hoped and more. The photos did not do the house justice. The pool, the decor, the beds, the kitchen, the garden.. everything was just beautiful. We really felt like we were experiencing a luxury escape. 
It was also so close to town, a 1 minute drive to the heart of Tanunda, yet was so peaceful and quiet, and only a 5 minute drive to some of the best wineries. I would recommend anyone to stay here. We were 5 girls on a girls weekend away, and we had ample space. We struggled to leave the house in the morning as we wanted to enjoy the house.... A++++"
13835460,132611171,2017-02-18,527656,Tom,"Beautifully furnished house, very comfortable stay and hosts are friendly and happy to provide suggestions. Highly recommended!"
13835460,133988338,2017-02-25,42421415,Gillian,A really beautiful home in a great central location for visiting the Barossa. Their Moorooroo wines and once a month pizza day is a must do.

"
13835460,142574537,2017-04-08,13729060,Ruchi,Really beautiful characterful house with a lovely pool. The photos do not do the home justice. A little bit of France in Barossa. It was such a treat to get to catch up and stay with friends in such a  stunning place. 
13835460,143432992,2017-04-11,42244997,Ben,"Wyndham's place looks good in the advertisement photos but it is actually much better in person. Best air bnb place I have stayed in. Beautiful house, great location and excellent communication from the host. Genuine 10/10."
13835460,144916150,2017-04-16,1904506,Ryan,We had the most amazing stay over easter. Highly recommend this place for 4 people . Great location and well set up. The garden and pool is an additional bonus. But mostly Wyndham's warm hospitality is what you will remember 
13835460,146842228,2017-04-23,20985693,Alex,"We had a wonderful long weekend recently at Wyndham place. The house is beautiful and it was very comfortable for five people. We got to meet Jodie ahead of checking in and taste some amazing wines, before being shown to the house. We particularly appreciated all of Wyndham's time and effort with communication - we got some amazing travel tips and he also checked in on us via text during the visit just to make sure we had everything we needed. There were some very thoughtful touches including fresh bread and milk. The house is a lovely place to spend some time in between exploring the Barossa. We stayed in during a couple of the evenings with some local produce and fantastic wine. Thank you for such a great experience!"
13835460,148583957,2017-05-01,8119723,Charlotte,A beautiful home with all the comforts you could ask for for a weekend at the Barossa. Wyndham and his family were so hospitable. Definitely visit Morooroo for a tasting. Magnificent wine.

Our hosts were very helpful, it was a nice touch to visit their winery to pick up the keys and taste the delicious wines. I would recommend this place to others. "
13835460,153361613,2017-05-21,2205263,Jacqueline,"We loved this place and highly recommend a stay there.  Wyndham was a real pleasure  to deal with, description was accurate, the home was lovely, comfortable and warm and welcoming.  We were two couples and came to Barossa for two nights, the home was walkable to coffee shops and town, easy to park at, spacious and well equipped.  Some nice touches like chocolates and fresh bread and milk that made it perfect.  Thank you for having us. "

13835460,159387343,2017-06-11,23785200,Paxton,"Wyndham's Place is the perfect stay to seal a day of indulgence in the Barossa. The accomodation is so spacious and beautifully decorated- it was even better than any of the photos!  We arrived to fresh bread, butter and jam, a well stocked mini bar and the heating already on (so lovely!) The beds are large with luxurious linens and the location is great for a walk down to dinner in town. We met Wyndham at their vineyard, Moorooroo, tasted some of the best wines we'd had that day and feasted on pizzas, calzones and a beautiful vintage. We were so blown away by the hospitality and quality of the overall experience - especially as it was a last minute booking we made on a whim. Highly recommend!"
13835460,164355121,2017-06-27,36753999,Jacqui,"Thankyou Wyndham, Patricia and Jodie we had a fantastic stay in your beautiful Wine Makers Retreat.  Highly recommend doing Check-in at Moorooroo winery :-)"
13835460,166257389,2017-07-03,69693033,Michelle,"Such a special place with French styled decor, every possible comfort and convenience thought of. We loved it. Beautiful landscaping and water fountain, apples and citrus fruit can be viewed from every window. Lovely hosts, only negative would be not enough time to see everything in this lovely area."
13835460,181479939,2017-08-13,42730549,Ellie,"This is an absolutely wonderful place to stay. The house is gorgeous, well heated and full of magnificent furniture. Wyndham, Jodi and Patricia were extremely helpful and sweet, and left a beautiful loaf of bread with butter and jam to welcome us! We had the most excellent stay and would love to come back."
13835460,185130407,2017-08-21,30881982,Emma,Wyndham and Co's place was lovely and communication great. Had everything we needed for a 4 night stay and was only a short walk into town. Everything was clean and beds were very comfortable. Would happily book again.
13835460,200290377,2017-10-05,5407005,Vicky,"The house is very private, in a quiet neighbourhood. It has many different spots to sit and relax both inside and out. It would be a great place to stay with family and friends, as there is so much space. As well as visiting vineyards we did lots of walks both around town and in the surrounding areas. Such beautiful countryside."
13835460,202104392,2017-10-09,76680376,Paula,"A beautifully decorated, tranquil, secluded, very private and luxurious place to stay.  Communication with host was excellent.  Perfect size and amenities for 2 independent travellers.  Location was excellent and could take a wonderful stroll down the main street from the house.  Wonderful little touches here and there.  Will definitely be back, perhaps when it is a bit warmer, to take advantage of the pool and pool area.  Thanks for sharing this amazing place with us Wyndham."
13835460,203037475,2017-10-14,54326589,Hannah,"What a great place !!! Our check in was so personnel. As we walked in there was some music playing and the heater already on. So cozy! The place is much bigger than expected. I think this is ideal for even two couples to stay in as there is 3 bedrooms. Two lovely ones that couples can use and one bedroom that would be good for two kids as has single beds. The play area that isn't attached to the house is a good relaxing spot also. There is so much to look at . Every area has different art work and interesting little things. The heating was amazing!! The bread and butter so yummy. The espresso machine is just what a international guest needs when jet lagged. The beds are very comfy. 

Only complaint. I wish I had longer to stay. "
13835460,205861878,2017-10-23,76664896,Kelli,The house is absolutely gorgeous and if we come back we will definitely want to stay there again; simply stunning! We loved the little courtyard for afternoon wines and cheese in the sun . The house is also beautifully furnished; with a huge lounge and comfy beds to relax in after your busy day in the Barossa. Very centrally located.

Loved the wine at their family vineyard and the history behind the property.  The amenities are all you could ask for and everything was homely and comfortable.  Thanks guys we will be back one day!"

13835460,333110235,2018-10-06,37270766,Rebecca,"Really enjoyed our time here. The accommodation is very close (less than 10 min drive) to lots of great wineries and the town centre It’s also a great space for a medium/big group, very clean nice decor and a lovely outdoor area to eat or swim in the pool. Hosts were lovely and very quick to respond to all messages, offering great local knowledge and recommendations "
13835460,344125128,2018-11-02,9650723,Linda,"Very comfortable, stylish home with beautiful garden spaces to relax in after busy days exploring the fabulous Barossa area. The house has a lovely feel, filled with lovely antiques and collectibles, but with all the modern conveniences of a new kitchen and bathroom.  Nice quiet street, very close to the Tanunda Bakery and an easy 1km walk to the centre of Tanunda. The private pool is an added bonus."
13835460,345740755,2018-11-05,111709397,Liana,Such a beautiful location and house. We had such a wonderful time and Wyndham made our stay exceptional. Every touch was thought about and harries vino was our favourite in the Barossa. Couldn’t recommend staying here enough!
13835460,346803678,2018-11-10,164391842,Ashley,"Exceeded expectations and I'd happily recommend this place to anyone who is looking to stay in Tanunda/Barossa. The kitchen is great, the yards are lovely, closes to restaurants/wineries,  there's a pool, large bath, double showers, huge bedrooms. There's no TV in the main lounge room but there are TV's in the bedrooms and also in the back pool house. Yeah, there's also a pool house with a kitchenette and lounge. The house is very much a character house in terms of style and there's a lot to appreciate."
13835460,347127384,2018-11-10,220192780,Alex,"Such a beautiful home in a quiet location that was the perfect start to a tour of the Barossa!  The check in process was so special and exceptional!  Meeting Rueben at the Moorooroo park vineyards is a brilliant touch. We felt that Moorooroo vineyards was the best winery we visited during our stay and were it not for the check in process we would never have visited it - surrounded by beautiful gardens and a cozy cellar door, this vineyard should be a must see for any visitor to the Barossa. To Wyndham, Patricia and Jodie, thank you for letting us share your piece of paradise!"
13835460,348456530,2018-11-14,12270250,Jon,"An absolute delight to stay here. So many unique, individual touches. Comfortable in every way. Really beautiful outdoor areas, garden & pool. Easy to walk to a fabulous bakery at the end of the street to try all the local breads, pastries. Also, a comfortable 10-15 minute stroll to a fully-equipped supermarket and quaint Tununda township. Wyndham and Patricia are delightful hosts who are professional and helpful in every way. Would definitely come back again."

13835460,353187759,2018-11-26,6156940,Briana,"Absolutely loved our time here. Only wish we could have stayed longer! The home is beautifully decorated, we were a group of 8 and rented winemakers 1 & 2 so there was plenty of space for all to relax. Just wished it was warm enough for the pool!"
13835460,360251407,2018-12-20,26876515,Laura,"My husband and I spent a few nights here exploring the Barossa valley at the start of our Australian travels. The place is absolutely gorgeous - the phrase “gracious home” comes to mind. Pictures don’t do it justice, it’s filled with little touches that make it a special place. The house is very cleverly situated so that you are surrounded on all sides by garden and feel like you’re in your own little oasis. The pool is an extra bonus for those traveling during the summertime and there are several places for outdoor dining (we didn’t use them but it would be great if you had a bigger group and wanted to do so). It’s also easy to walk into central Tanunda to go to the restaurants there if you don’t feel like driving. The hosts were also very quick to respond to a couple queries we had.

The fresh local produce left for us was plentiful & delicious including wine and chocolates, and we knew there was always help at hand even though we had complete privacy. Both beds were really comfy with soft warm doonas as well as a lighter cotton blanket for warmer nights. There was a little bit of street noise from passing traffic but not enough to wake us up. It was ideally located in town within easy walking distance to cafes, pubs & places to eat. I'd love to come back in winter to enjoy the fireplace. What a gorgeous cottage! We loved our visit to Angaston which was made even better by our lovely hosts. "

We had so much fun checking out the wineries Jim told us about, and loved having the inside track on the valley from a tour and awesome maps he gave us! The cottage is cozy and super relaxing with a back patio to die for. The kitchen makes me want to be a master chef and was stocked with all sort of delicious goodies. Simply put, stay at the Bluebird—it was absolutely splendid!"

The tour of surrounding wineries and places of interest with Jim was the icing on the cake. It’s a shame we live so far away, we’d be back in the beautiful Barossa in a heartbeat. 

Thanks Jim and Jeanette for your wonderful hospitality.
Kind regards, 
Sue and Bruce"

I stayed in the house with 4 other women so being a large home with 2 full bathrooms plus an additional powder room in the laundry was a real bonus. There was a combustion fireplace which would have been lovely to use but there was no supplied wood, kindling or suggestion to use it. A house information & local recommendation book would have been very handy as well, there were leaflets & brochures but the owners recommendations would have been great. And supplied Wifi would have made this house perfect. Our stay was however very well enjoyed & with a few wineries within walking distance this house was in a fantastic location & a very quiet street. The beds were comfortable, the bedding very warm in the cold weather & the towels were excellent. All in all this was a great house in an excellent location."

The break was just what we needed and being such a food lover the local biscuits and fridge and pantry additions were such a lovely touch. I could have stayed a week! We'll be back! Would highly recommend. Kelly and Tim "
14129531,172123539,2017-07-20,131576689,Sue,"Perfect location- nestled in the barossa landscape
Great views yet private
Cosy, warm, gorgeous accomodation with so many extra touches-
Delicious homemade jam, chutney, sauce, choc chip biscuits

I thoroughly recommend Jenny's place"
14129531,175818970,2017-07-29,174273,Joe,A fantastic place to stay in the Barossa Valley. The best airbnb we have ever stayed in.
14129531,181013912,2017-08-12,11312737,Tom,"A really great place to stay, and from where to discover the beautiful Barossa. I can highly recommend staying here. The accommodation is great: I think it's even better in the flesh than the photos. We stayed in the middle of winter and it was lovely and cosy with the wood burner roaring. Jenny was a fabulous host, and we were met with a fridge full of Barossa goodness. Location is great: really secluded in the middle of the vines, but just a 5 min drive into Tanunda. Stay here!"
14129531,182538810,2017-08-15,135191917,Alison,"HVH has our highest recommendation. From start to finish it was a quality experience. It is peaceful, private, beautifully modern while having cottage charm. Jenny is a generous host with all that  she provides - provisions, furnishings, and fitout of the space. We look forward to returning and hopefully becoming regulars over the years - it was that good."
14129531,185872059,2017-08-23,16698609,Kurt,"This was one of the most well appointed, quality accommodations we have been lucky to stay. The attention to detail that Jenny has put into the place clearly stands out and you can sense the passion that Jenny must have for accommodating guests. This was our first trip to the Barossa and we will be back for sure and will be staying here again! The generous welcome provisions that Jenny left for us were amazing and full of local produce to showcase the region. The place is so well fitted with quality finishes you feel relaxed the moment you walk in. We had 3 nights here and were sad when we had to leave. The comfort of sitting in front of the wood fire, looking out the large window over the hills with a red wine is the idea of perfect! Thank you Jenny for providing such an amazing place."
14129531,187298445,2017-08-26,48823106,Fiona,Jenny's place is AMAZING and I can't recommend it enough. It has all the comforts of home with all the little touches making it that little extra special e.g. tea and coffee and breakfast foods provided (local produce!). The hideaway cottage is so peaceful and you get to wake up in the middle of a vineyard but it is also only minutes away from all the wineries and Tanunda town centre. Bikes aare provided and available to use too! Jenny is very responsive to any questions you may have and gave us all the privacy we needed. Will definitely stay here next time we come back!
14129531,189486435,2017-09-02,14032648,Jenna,"Thank you Jenny for allowing us to experience such a beautiful piece of heaven! Amazing location and the special

14129531,198563653,2017-09-30,2326015,Danielle,"Fantastic stay at the hideaway. It was our first time visiting the barossa, and the location was fantastic (though recommend having your own car, there's parking available). The place was very clean, comfortable and Jenny made the stay even more special with local produce stocked in the fridge to make snacks and breakfast so easy. Thank you Jenny, highly recommended"
14129531,200280625,2017-10-05,93089940,Claudia & Edward,"This lovely home exceeded all our expectations.. in a great location just off tanunda, yet very secluded for that peaceful feel. The interior is super clean, warm and rustic and there is so much attention to detail. Bonuses like a fireplace, double head shower and outdoor gazebo just add to the wow factor. On top of that, a fridge full of goodies - cant ask for more!"
14129531,204808561,2017-10-20,21301303,Stuart,"The cottage is beautiful - it's well designed and thought out with an amazingly high level of finish in the workmanship. It was a lovely place to stay. The location is excellent - close to Tanunda for its amenities, cafes and restaurants and central to the major wineries. The little touches of fresh produce in the pantry and fridge and the Nespresso machine were particularly appreciated and made it very homely indeed. 

Unfortunately the wifi was essentially non existent but the owners said they'd been having trouble with it. 

I would recommend this place to any couple who are looking to be centrally located but away from the hustle and bustle of the town or resorts - a real 5 star experience."
14129531,205298438,2017-10-21,150023563,Domenica,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jenny’s place. Location was great, close to everything but secluded and private at the same time! Great view from the lounge looking over the vineyards. Cottage is very clean and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Loved the personal touches like fresh flowers and note with reccommendations from the host."
14129531,208965008,2017-11-04,85755571,Roland,"Thanks again Jenny for the GF pantry items, the small extras were lovely. We used the Fireplace. The whole week exceeded our expectations! Regards Roland & Anne-louise Knight."
14129531,213136585,2017-11-19,16226972,Jen,"If you stay in the Barossa, STAY HERE. We had a ball. This little cottage is stunning, and every little luxury is thought of by the incredibly hospitable Jenny. They kindly allowed us to borrow their bikes and we spent two days ambling through gorgeous wineries - the only way to explore the Barossa! Thanks again :) "

Perfect for a getaway and great location near Tanunda and many wineries. Jenny thought of everything and we were very impressed with the stocked fridge. Thanks again, we have enjoyed a summer stay and would love to come back for winter to enjoy that fire."
14129531,240947237,2018-03-07,49762334,Glenn,"What a wonderful few days we have just spent at  Halley Valley Hideaway. Jenny had thought of everything- every comfort, delectable snacks from the local area, suggestions to see and do and although they are close at hand if we needed anything - totally unobtrusive. Close to “town” but still nestled quietly and privately amongst the grapevines - so relaxing! A shower and a bed to die for!!! Thank you for a wonderful, much needed break!"
14129531,241611478,2018-03-09,70129011,Stefanie,"Perfect place to stay in barossa, close to the main town. Jenny thought of everything and made our stay so comfortable."

14129531,250644080,2018-04-06,177974743,Karen,Lovely lovely place
14129531,251362681,2018-04-07,25181424,Jess,"We loved this place! My only regret was that I only got to spend minimal time here as I was with the bridal party for the wedding we were down for so my partner Ben got to enjoy it a little more.
Jenny had delicious food here all stocked for us - all local (why don't we live in the Barossa?!?!), and what I assume to be her own home grown tomatoes which may have just been the best I've eaten. Along with other homemade goodies she had there but I didn't get a chance to sample them all. 
The quality of the linen, towels and robes where great. The towel was so soft and fluffy - how do people do this? Something I've not mastered yet so I fully appreciate. 
There was also the great touch of make up wipes left for me - it's almost as if Jenny knew I wouldn't have any and be ready to get rid of the heavy bridesmaid makeup. 
We look forward to returning for a winter escape at some stage."
14129531,257621299,2018-04-27,172254892,Scott,Magnificent little cottage. Great little add ons like a fully provisioned fridge. Sparkling clean. Great location. Highly recommended.

Jenny provided enough provisions to last our stay to at least get our day started. We used this as a base to travel around the Barossa and then to come back and relax in front of the fire. Although we didn’t use them, there are bikes to ride around. The big window in the lounge area overlooked the property and surrounds and there is a gazebo to have a cup of tea, read a book and watch the wild life. Would totally recommend this place without hesitation."

The cottage offers a serene environment where you can wind down and enjoy stunning views of the Barossa. It’s also conveniently located, easy to find and access.
Jenny offered thoughtful amenities including homemade sauce and jams, and locally sourced breakfast foods.
The modern cottage offers a unique accommodation experience which for us, was flawless.

Jo was very accommodating who thoughtfully provided lots of local knowledge in the pamphlets/maps in the common areas. It was only a bit of a challenge for us when we wanted to cook up a feast as the kitchen was basically equipped. Nevertheless, we managed it with a big team effort and served up one of the meals of our trip!"

There are two bedrooms, two bathrooms and two living rooms, so it was like huge for 3 of us. Plenty of places for eating out and look around in the town. Will definitely stay again if ever going that way again."

14269050,206754442,2017-10-27,101876836,Jason,"Great little b&b attached to a working winery just out of Angaston. The spacious, private, self contained rooms are part of a beautiful old period country house. Especially liked the outdoor eating area where we could enjoy the lovely country breakfast with farm fresh ingredients provided by Jo and gaze out over the rolling hills.  

Hosts were very friendly and welcoming. 

Would definitely recommend."

A very secluded location (we only spotted a few vehicles along the road during our stay) and a stunning sunset over the rolling hills. A great location to explore the Barossa and Eden Valleys, and plenty of cute towns to explore. 

A clean and warm place to stay, with adorable homely touches throughout. A delicious breakfast and kitchen facilities as well - would definitely return!"

14377105,421177422,2019-03-08,79448304,Michelle,"A spotlessly clean house that is on a busy road just on the outskirts of Angaston. We were only given access to two bedrooms but I think there are three. Two very large and modern bathrooms, one with a bath, the other with a spa bath. An outside sitting area that feels a bit like sitting in a car park. 
We had some check in difficulties, it wasn’t clear that we had to go to a nearby winery to get the key. The host kindly let us check in early but then we ran late getting to our function because of time trying to contact the host and getting the key. 
No breakfast provisions, but a large kitchen."
14697430,329446165,2018-09-29,63000467,Alan,Great location to the wineries and for anyone looking for a photography holiday day and astro night.  So nice to stoke the fire.

14828790,102303674,2016-09-17,12127546,Matt,"Seriously brilliant stay. Anthony (filling in for Alicia whilst she was away) did a top job with recommendations and the 'room' was actually an apartment. Extremely comfy bed, fantastic shower and a zero degrees plunge pool to get rid of the hangover :) 

Couldn't recommend highly enough. 

Vintner's is a 4 minute drive away for the farmer's market and a fantastic dinner, if you're over Barossa wines there's a great little authentic Italian place across the bridge from the White House and you can walk to the bike rental place which is directly opposite the bike trail. You can cycle to a number of wineries from there. 

Top trip. Thanks again. 

Matt and Bryony "

Their place is absolutely stunning, very comfortable, spacious and very clean. It is quite central to all of the top rated restaurants and winery's, and the neighbourhood overall is also gorgeous.

The place was big and comfortable, lovely clean bathroom and facilities, great tv and wifi.
The bottle of wine to welcome us was a lovely touch.
There's also a wealth of information and recommendations for what to see and do in the area.

The linen reminded me of a Hospital linen in the 1930's. I just thought that if the bedding was up to scratch, it is worth the price. But i didn't get any sleep at all, my wife and i slept in separate beds because of the beds being way under what you would expect.!! Budget sleeping accommodation.!"

We picked it because it had plenty of rooms. We did not realise it also splits into separate rents if required.

Old / antique décor - an interesting place to stay.

Would recommend booking the wine tour through the house too."

Walking distance to shops for a little bit of retail therapy or relaxing in a cute little cafe for a coffee.. but far enough out of the Main Street to have a lots of privacy! 

We also made use of their bus transfer services to get to and from Hentley Farm restaurant and the bus drive Bob was an absolute delight!

We choose to do the hop on hop off bus around the valley and the house was the perfect place to come back to after a busy day!  We enjoyed the lovely back yard (when the weather cooled off!) and our only complaint is that we couldn't stay any longer.

We started our stay with a lovely personalised note wishing our baby a happy birthday and her detailed notes made us feel right at home. her chemical free living and her bookshelf is admirable!
The best part was her offer to use any fruit from her backyard so we had 3 days of the best ever tree to table orange juice

The fruit trees were in full swing and we enjoyed many apricots and peaches (thanks Bridget). A great location to begin our exploration of the Barossa Valley - our favourite winery must have been Rockford but there are so many great ones.

Tanunda is a great location to explore the Barossa from and walking distance to some yummy restaurants for dinner (1918 and Musque and the pub was pretty decent too for another option). We unfortunately weren't able to go to FermentAsian as it was closed while we were there, but everyone in the valley speaks of it as their #1!  The beds were super comfy and thoughtful heating options throughout. Thank you for sharing your home with us!"

Would not hesitate to stay here again
15132613,309837574,2018-08-19,59848223,Ben,"'Home' is a word we never take for granted. It's a place that simply can't be manufactured; shaped by your life story, and what makes it your private escape. You walk through the door, and you feel at home. 

At Bridget's place, we felt like we'd come home to a different life for a few precious days. It's a parallel dimension – like a dream so vivid you swear it could be real, only better; you really can go back and relive it all again.

No other place has made us smile quite as much as Bridget's place. It's chock full of character, from the 'help yourself' board for the edible garden to the artwork, books, vintage magazines and curious memorabilia.

We hope to return someday!

15485305,144446734,2017-04-15,25249005,Tommy,"Very charming period property with a host to match! Perched on a hilltop with great district views, we stayed at Marble Lodge over the Easter long weekend. Centrally located with just a 5 minute stroll into the Main Street of Angaston, this property is conveniently located yet very peaceful and serene. Our host Shirley is warm, friendly and a real character. Our suite was impeccably furnished, clean and warm with period charm and everything was thought of. Comfortable bed with pillow menu was icing on the cake. Breakfast was delicious with variety and made all the more interesting as Shirley is a great conversationalist with plenty of interesting stories to tell. Would thoroughly recommend to couples and families alike! We would definitely stay here again on a future return trip."
15485305,248650160,2018-04-01,1915948,Katie,"WOW! Outstanding accommodation. Shirley’s hospitality was incredible, the location and suite was stunning. We’ll be back! Katie"

15485550,155825449,2017-05-29,73888881,Avikar,"I loved staying in Melanie's house, it's very tastefully decorated, and one of the most well organised AirBnBs I have stayed in. There was no need to look for things,  everything was where you expect it to be...space in the fridge with a marked guest section and on the table, a continental breakfast.  A great place to stay for a Barossa visit."
15485550,205326210,2017-10-22,94164087,Tanya,"Fantastic location, great communication, we had a wonderful time in the Barossa at Melanie’s "
15485550,211457859,2017-11-12,734827,Carine,"Melanie was a fantastic host, very friendly and welcoming. The place is super clean and central if you are planning on visiting the wineries around the region. You can even walk to a few nearby ones, and walk to the main street for cafes and restaurants. A car is needed to see the rest. Good value overall. Good for couples or solo travellers."

15485550,230284174,2018-01-27,165683007,Malcolm,Melanie was a amiable host of a well presented cosy and Retro themed house. Very welcoming and close to shops and travel targets. Wonderful airconditioning a delight during the hot periods of the unusually high temp Summer. I would highly recommend Melanie and her home to any travellers to Tanunda and the Barossa generally.

15485550,423701774,2019-03-15,40765902,Janey,"Melanie was a great host. She immediately made me feel welcome, and encouraged me to use the common spaces in her home. The room was very comfortable and everything was sparkling clean. I enjoyed travelling around the Barossa in the daytime, and coming back to Melanie's comfortable and welcoming house in the evening. The location 10 minutes from the main street of Tanunda is very convenient. All in all highly recommended."
15579249,135372971,2017-03-04,8250954,Min,"Maria's house is stunning.  A true holiday house - spacious, beautiful and homely.  The bottle of wine and breakfast supplies were a generous supply.  Outdoor dining looking over some vines was stunning in the warm evenings.  We were there to cycle the Barossa trail and the house was well positioned for us to achieve that.  Many thoughtful touches to the house including magazines and kids toys.  Highly recommended."
15579249,137006171,2017-03-12,57183417,Brendan,"Great location, beautifully fitted out house with easy access to the whole Barossa area"

I recommend it!"
15579249,220773708,2017-12-23,3143360,Craig,"Casa Rossa is a great space. Definitely feels like a stylish, contemporary home rather than a cold holiday place top sleep. Great beds, movies and cd's, good provisions and all of the utensils to cook. Highly recommended."
15579249,221226721,2017-12-25,52992194,Jonny & Joanne,"Definitely a 5 star host! Communicative, clean, responsive while being incredibly friendly. Couldn't ask for a better host! I would be happy to recommend Maria's place to all my friends and family we can't wait to return. We had an awesome time."
15579249,235203115,2018-02-15,24060304,Andrew,A really wonderful country location with great bird life. Quiet but so close to so many great wineries and restaurants. The house has been modernised to a high standard and was spotlessly clean. The welcome pack was very comprehensive and saved us doing any food shopping. An unexpected bonus was a visit from a family of kangaroos on our second evening.
15579249,236925599,2018-02-20,168822819,David,"Great place, well located, fantastic outdoor eating area and vineyard gave a truly Tuscan feel to the place. Many interesting and novel touches and more food provided than we could eat. Well done, nothing could be faulted and highly recommended."
15579249,243402215,2018-03-15,22293108,Kate,"We stayed at Casa Rosa for three nights. It was wonderful. The location is close to the town, but private, with a lovely outdoor dining area, over looking a vineyard. The bird life was magnificent and kangaroos visited the garden. We found the house exceptionally well equipped with beautiful high quality crockery and cooking equipment. There was a very generous welcome pack. The bedrooms were very comfortable with good quality linen, the bathrooms had great walk in showers and nice toiletries. We watched films together in the evening on the comfy sofa.  We would love to return for a longer stay. Highly recommended, you could not fail to enjoy this lovely house."
15579249,251414022,2018-04-08,13727593,Diana,"Casa Rossa was a perfect weekend get away! Lots of thoughtful touches, great communication and perfect location!"
15579249,257629414,2018-04-27,179315206,Thomas,"Fabulous home in the Barossa. 

We loved everything about this Airbnb stay. Thoughtful provisions were left for our arrival, including bread and spreads, milk, OJ, snacks, and sparkling wine ready to chill. The house is tastefully renovated and well maintained, and appointed to a high standard throughout. We loved the many “extras” available including toys for the kids, board games, the vinyl record collection and turntable and the open log fire. We slept well in the comfy beds.  

The house is located in a secluded location with its own small vineyard. Our only disappointment was that we couldn’t stay for longer!"
15579249,266966040,2018-05-21,28658675,Rebecca,Beautiful place to base yourself while you explore the Barossa

15579249,288473960,2018-07-10,38311823,Shaun And Sarah,"An Absolute 10/10 
A very large well appointed home, beautifully furnished and great personal touches.  We greatly appreciated the trouble the hosts had gone to with a lovely bottle of wine waiting for us on the kithcen bench, if that wasnt enough there was also an ample carafe of port to enjoy whilst relaxing next to the fire place after a long day exploring the Barossa.  Fully ducted air con kept the place warm and cozy.  Wonderful rural position,secluded and peaceful yet close to shops at Lyndoch and easy access to wineries.  The outdoor area is amazing  youd swear you're  in Italy, surrounded by vineyards and great views over the Barossa  Plenty of stocks for brekkie and a little treat for those with a sweet tooth was much appreciated.  Maria is a wonderful host and has local managers to assist with anything you need, they were great to deal with and prompt with their replies.   Will definitely be back, thank you Maria we had an amazing stay."
15579249,298009724,2018-07-29,21140360,Will,"Staying at Maria's was an absolute pleasure, and if I ever return to the Barossa, I know where I'll stay."

15579249,350938514,2018-11-21,10292408,Steve,"A very memorable first trip to the Barossa Valley!!
We visited the Barossa Valley with another couple.  We were all first time travelers to the Barossa and did we ever luck out when we chose Maria's place.  It was the first time I've booked an Airbnb where the pictures and description did not do justice to what we experienced.  To create that perfect first impression, Maria had left us a beautiful ""welcome basket"".  The location was perfect.  We could drive to anywhere in the Barossa and Eden Valleys in 20-25 minutes or less.  We hiked in the mornings at nearby conservation areas, toured several top notch wineries in the afternoons, and BBQ'd and ate 'al fresco' on the terrace while watching the sunsets in the evenings.  Our wives had a very relaxing and enjoyable experience at a Spa in nearby Gawler as well.  One evening we even had some kangaroos visit us right in the backyard!  An enthusiastic two thumbs up from all four of us!"
15579249,354149633,2018-11-30,21713454,Amanda,"Casa Rossa was the perfect Barossa base for our party of 2 couples. 

Stylish, comfortable and really well equipped with more bacon, eggs, juice etc in the breakfast pack than we could possibly eat in 4 days! 

Lovely, quiet, cosy, elegant home that we would love to return to and 100% recommend to anyone looking for a perfect, central but private base for a wonderful Barossa experience."
15579249,422749857,2019-03-11,71604510,Susan,"Great house, very clean, lovely towels and linen, nice little touches like wine and breakfast provisions. You do need a car but shops and wineries all within a short drive. We loved the peace and quiet!"
15670050,141006345,2017-04-01,122165366,Linda,"We had such a wonderful stay in April. A beautiful home in a fantastic location. The attention to detail was shown throughout the house, from the decor and little luxuries scattered around the house to the Netflix and apple tv access. 

The kitchen is fully stocked, making the breakfast cook up a breeze. Oh, and the breakfast provisions, what a bounty! 

With fantastic restaurants and cafes at our doorstep it was everything we could have asked for and more from a weekend in the Barossa. 

We look forward to staying again, thanks from the Carraghers and the Nunans

I visited Tanunda with a group of girlfriends to celebrate my 30th birthday and Andy and Natalie went above and beyond to make our trip unforgettable. 
We arrived to welcome champagne, a birthday cake, balloons and a card. There was the most amazing breakfast spread on offer - some of Barossa's finest produce - as well as toiletries and other amenities.
The house itself was big and beautiful The decor was trendy and we felt so at home, immediately. It was a great space to spend a girls weekend away!
There were two big bathrooms which made getting ready quite easy. (Even for 8 females!)
I also should mention the beautiful outdoor area where we enjoyed our breakfast in the sunshine. 
Location wise it is 10/10. We walked to the supermarket and some wine bars. We hired bikes and cycled from the house to many wineries around Tanunda as well. 
I would definitely stay at Bilyara house again and I would 100% recommend it to other guests. 
Thank you so much for being outstanding hosts Andy and Natalie!!!"

We felt like we were staying with old friends due to the warm correspondence beforehand and how we were greeted upon arrival. The space was clean, well lit, and quite private, with the ability to interact with the hosts in the shared space if you wish or keep to yourselves. We chose to enjoy a wine and a chat in the evening when we arrived back from our winery visit. This location is great value for a person or couple enjoying the Barossa and surrounds."

Anthea and Stefan were very welcoming on arrival and their fur family were just gorgeous. Anthea also shared some great walks to do around Angaston of which I went on one after I checked out and loved every minute. It is a quiet, clean and cozy place to stay."
15811271,269730269,2018-05-27,141236902,Christopher,"Anthea and Stefan are a couple of natural hosts who make you feel welcome and at ease very quickly. Our bed was very comfy and even had electric blankets for those chilly autumn nights. Even without that, the fire was going 24/7 to keep the whole house warm. We enjoyed the company of Merry (small dog). The 2 cats kept their distance, sadly for us. The house has Anthea's art work everywhere, which is just lovely and certainly adds a special touch to the house. Both of our hosts were accommodating, helpful and natural. We would highly recommend. The house is close enough for a stroll down town for a meal out, although the driveway is quite steep. Not for the faint hearted, but great exercise. Special little touches included a packet of local dried fruit blend and a bottle of red wine, should you choose to indulge. "
15811271,273949038,2018-06-07,9323622,Barbara,"Good location, nice warm house.  Loved having our own bedroom, tv room and bathroom.  Privacy if you want it, or join Anthea and Stephan in the evening.  Great artwork on display throughout the house.  Thankyou"

15811271,421190595,2019-03-08,61336709,Stephen,I was happy to have stayed at Anthea and Stefan's place. Anthea is an outgoing and super friendly character that was welcoming and loved a chat. The guest area gives you plenty of room to relax and chill at the back of their house.
15811271,427514915,2019-03-23,242164096,Maureen,"Anthea's place, ""The Art Box"" is in Angaston, within the wine region of South Australia and in picturesque surroundings. Pets and a few steps are within the home. The driveway is steep, but manageable. We found Anthea to be very warm, friendly and helpful. Check in was no problem. The bed was comfortable. There was a separate sitting room,  bedroom,  toilet and bathroom for guest use only. Didn't have to share anything, which we were very pleased about. Everything was very clean and neat. Anthea is an artist and has many pieces of her work on show. Very interesting.
Thank you for a very   pleasant stay Anthea."

The spectacular 25 acre property not only boasts absolute privacy but is surrounded by beautiful rose gardens, a chicken coupe, sheep paddock and green lawns. 

Inside will make you feel right at home with warm and welcoming furnishings, comfy beds and well pressured showers. The home was immaculately clean and tidy, a well fitted kitchen with views outside made cooking a meal for my friends and family more than enjoyable. 

I highly recommend this property to anyone visiting the area, its close to all the wineries and good eating spots. It will surely make you want to return. 

Matilda, her partner and her and her parents will make your stay just perfect. So thanks again for their hospitality and making our stay so enjoyable. "

Close to all the facilities of Tanunda (even walking distance if desired) and easy access to the rest of the Barossa. Real bonuses of separate bathrooms for mixed group stays and plenty of comfortable space. Comfortable beds are always important and those here were great. Would definitely stay again....

Thanks to Matilda who is a great host with great and timely communication throughout booking and check in. "

16055904,184521852,2017-08-20,36569571,Nicholas,"We had a fantastic mini-break at Hoffman's Hill in the Barossa. My two young boys had a ball exploring the enourmous estate. Comfortable and beautifully turned down bedrooms were a real feature as was the bath in the master bedroom suite. So relaxing and unique. 
The Chicken coup was a bonus with the chickens laying 14 eggs in 3 days!!!
In summary very close to all the wineries, comfortable, modern with some luxurious touches. Great experience."

It was so peaceful and serene and the views and garden are even more special than the photos indicate. You could easily relax and unwind at the house all day, with a bottle of wine and some nibbles. The beds were super comfortable and the layout of the house is great for hosting 2 or 3 couples or group of friends/family.  Fresh eggs, brekky stuff and a lovely bottle of wine were a nice touch. We definitely would highly recommend Matilda’s place and would love to come back again in the future! "

16055904,336068445,2018-10-13,134830828,Miranda,"This is an absolutely idyllic location - you can sit out on the back verandah for hours and hours, on comfy sofas sipping the Barossa wine you’ve just bought, looking out over Matilda’s perfectly kept and just beautiful garden, over to Tanunda, its rooftops and church spires (and later, its twinkling lights) and to the hills beyond. Just magic. Our boys also loved exploring the extensive bush garden on the property. Plus there’s a very comfortable house to enjoy with everything you might need and lots of space for a family of 4 to find their own areas to retreat to when they need. It was the perfect base for this Barossa weekend away with children. I hope we’ll be back!"

Secluded enough to be peaceful and private yet less than 50m from the main rd and coffee shops.

It has loads of character and is a really easy and convenient and value for money place to stay.
It was also wonderful having the completely flat access from the car to the house.
And we made us of the covered outdoor area and BBQ.
We would definitely stay in this wonderful character cottage again."

Only 1 minute walk from the Main Street of Tanunda and just around the corner from the best coffee shop in the Barossa.

The beds were comfortable and the cottage itself very cosy, this place is perfect for friends and families alike. Would definitely stay again. "
16147052,161928563,2017-06-19,31936841,Daniel,"We loved our stay here. It was very homey and cozy!
The cottage was right in the middle of town but very secluded. It was easy walking distance to cafes, shops, nice restaurants, etc. 
We were helped immediately when we locked ourselves out...and we hadn't even had any wine yet. 
The fireplace was great and there was firewood,  kindling, and firestarters provided. The fireplace was a major bonus to sit back and have a fire with a nice shiraz. 
Breakfast was provided. The bacon was fresh from the butcher and the eggs were delicious. We made our own brekkie easily with the ingredients and pots, panda, and utensils provided.
Thanks very much for a great stay.
Sarah and Daniel"

16147052,256854748,2018-04-24,185075990,Christine,We cannot speak highly enough about Elsie's Cottage.  It is central to Tanunda and the Barossa Valley.  We stayed in the cottage for three nights and wished we were staying longer.  It was very close to hotels and restaurants but situated in a quiet position.  The breakfast provisions were amazing as were some little extra treats left for us.  The kitchen and bathroom have been moderised while the sitting room and bedrooms retain an old worlds charm. Amanda was very prompt in answering text messages we sent to her.  If we are ever back in the Barossa we hope that Elsie's Cottage is available for our accommodation.

16147052,413676496,2019-02-17,235103612,Chris,"Finding the cottage was a bit of a problem but that was also a blessing as it is set back from the road and traffic noise was not a problem.  The location is ideal with the cottage being within walking distance of restaurants, coffee shops and a newly opened wine bar.  For those who don't mind a 1.3km walk, it's even within walking distance of a micro brewery!  The breakfast supplies were great but the special treats (home make biscuits, chocolates etc) were even better.  These certainly helped with the late night munchies and were really appreciated.  The cottage was very homely and comfortable.  I would certainly stay there again if I was visiting the Barossa."

16246918,205297813,2017-10-21,142082611,Jess,A nice place to stay in a beautiful location :)
16246918,222137221,2017-12-29,162743405,David,"A great spot. Private and secluded so you will need to drive to dinner etc. Very peaceful. Provide you with everything you need. There is no TV so bring a book. Lachy and his family are polite and friendly but at the same time leave you to you own devises. The goats, chicken and ducks are very happy!!!!! Would we spend the time and money to go back _YES"
16246918,242434886,2018-03-11,141603644,Dylan,"Very friendly! 
Nice and close to everything we wanted to see."
16246918,246150783,2018-03-25,42265616,Keith,"We loved everything about our weekend at Lachlan's Lavender Cabin.  It was so beautifully quiet and we loved the sound of the sheep and kookaburra's in the background, just behind the cabin.  The cabin was immaculately kept with fantastic provisions for breakfast.  We could not fault anything, so we will be returning. Lachlan was a great guy and his family were amazing - we felt very much at home with them, including Emmy the dog and their two beautiful cats. Thanks again Lachlan - your cabin is is a credit to you."

16246918,258314848,2018-04-29,72469609,Miroslav,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Lachlan's cabin. The place is immaculately clean with a heap of thoughtful touches. The area is also really charming, and seeing all types of animals around, ranging from kangaroos to goats and chickens adds a really nice touch.
I would certainly recommend Lachlan and this cabin to others."
16246918,263794091,2018-05-13,10947167,Kyle,Loved staying in Lavender Cottage. It was the perfect place for our weekend away.
16246918,274681106,2018-06-10,87889070,Sarah,Lachlan puts in errort to make your stay a little more luxurious. I notice the little things. The bed was so comfy due to the quality mattress and the beautiful Sheridan sheets. Loved the Sukin skincare  and the little jugs of orange juice and milk for breakfast. Would highly recommend to any Barossa adventuring couples.
16246918,277658634,2018-06-17,31058273,Allen,"If you want a rural retreat close to everything the Barossa has to offer, you can't go past Lavender Cottage. Friendly easy going host. Comfortable cabin with well appointed modern facilities."
16246918,307199261,2018-08-14,201400754,John,"Great little cabin with all we needed for a two night stay, close to everything we wanted to see in the Barossa. Quiet Bush location."
16246918,309872330,2018-08-19,148004696,Shelley,"We had a lovely time staying in the cottage. The hosts were super attentive - they saw us having a cheese platter out on the verandah early evening (it was quite chilly) and Nick (host) brought us up a patio heater so we could relax and enjoy the beautiful outdoors of the property. There was a lovely black lab & cute little goat bounding around, not to mention the beautiful natural wildlife & birds on our doorstep. Fresh bread juice & yoghurt were also there for us to enjoy. 5 x right turns on the local roads and you were at the Whispering Wall a must sightseeing destination. Thank you Lachlan & family "
16246918,313695875,2018-08-26,116192490,Tyson,Well appointed private cabin with fantastic amenities and a great location

16246918,333894032,2018-10-07,581495,Ruth,Lavender cabin is in a peaceful part of Barossa Valley.  The outlook is onto large gum trees. Although situated next to the main house there is privacy.  Inside the cabin is comfortable.
16246918,336103247,2018-10-14,195359643,Vikki,A wonderful beautiful cabin away from home. My partner and I loved the area and also being greeted by the hosts dog 'Emmy'...
16246918,347153157,2018-11-11,224443694,James,Great communication and the hosts greatly want to help ensure you have a great stay.

16246918,368456414,2019-01-07,230258917,Tom,"Private little Cabin on a family property.
Air conditioning was nice feature.
Lovely big bed with nice linen.
Pillows were also comfy.
Nice extras! Milk,Bread, Coffee, Tea, Juice, Yogurt, Cereal all provided :)
Location is 30 minutes drive from Nuriootpa the main town centre of the Barossa. And majority of Wineries are about that distance from here. So the place is a tad out of the way from the main happenings of the Barossa.

Overall would recommend as it was a comfortable , fresh and clean BNB"
16246918,406283999,2019-01-29,214543439,Mick,Should have each cabin with a name on them also address at front would have made it easy to find
16246918,412997394,2019-02-17,224085400,Michelle,Awesome accommodation. Lachlan goes all out to ensure you are comfortable.

16381489,169536981,2017-07-13,7812088,Jack,A wonderful stay on a wonderful property in a wonderful location. Sharon's place has everything for couples and families. We enjoyed saying hello to the farm animals every morning. The proximity to wineries all around made this place the perfect home base and launching pad - Seppletsfield winery is walking distance and is a must see. We enjoyed the peace and quiet and making fires in the fireplace was a nice way to keep warm. I'd recommend Sharon's place to any staying in the area. Thank you
16381489,204198060,2017-10-17,69716523,Nita,"The spot is beautiful and a great view of the palms and nature. I booked it because of the spa bath- which was very relaxing.  Amenities are basic but great if you just need a place to stay close to the wineries.  The breakfast included was adequate and we got a bottle of Jacobs Creek wine, with the extra cost.  A good basic cabin spot (family)  if this is what you are looking for close to wineries for a quick stay over."
16381489,224356751,2018-01-02,115976247,Leti,Very nice place to enjoy the Barossa
16381489,227075537,2018-01-13,2202732,Michelle & Alexandre,Nice family oriented place close to fabulous vineyards.
16381489,249296358,2018-04-02,27088420,Amy,"Due to some miscommunication we didn’t end up staying at Sharon’s property, but she was fantastic at organising us some alternate accommodation even though she was on holiday herself. Would definitely recommend booking with Sharon, she went above and beyond to sort out the situation. Thanks for the great hospitality."
16381489,250119240,2018-04-04,1155463,Maxwell,"Very nice and quiet place in a handy location, got everything we need indoor and outdoor, we would bring out kid back here for our future trips as well."
16381489,252750523,2018-04-12,155838527,Callum,Right in the heart of Barossa. Great place to stay for just a couple staying for a couple days.
16381489,259354446,2018-05-01,51415675,Robby,"Loved the wildlife, farm animals, and the fireplace!"
16381489,261739186,2018-05-07,186173972,Luke,This cabin is in the perfect location!  It's charm and the country side are magnificent. I highly recommend this cabin for your next visit to Barossa Valley.
16381489,267504701,2018-05-21,190532607,Stephen,Excellent cabin! Fireplace was a nice touch. Super quick responses!
16381489,267813657,2018-05-23,104868346,Jerry,Sharon was fantastic to deal with - simple and breezy
16381489,275419808,2018-06-11,53349708,Katie,Lovely place to stay in the Barossa. The listing didn’t really mention the cabins were a duplex - the walls were very thin and we could hear every noise from the people next door. Comfortable to stay in.
16381489,283972996,2018-07-01,3898667,Jasmine,"Great communication, easy check-in, cosy cabin and great location with easy access to wineries. Thanks for a lovely stay, hope to be back soon!"
16381489,345749627,2018-11-05,2897480,Adam,Great setup and a stones throw from some of the best wineries in Barossa
16381489,363975578,2018-12-29,5083108,Penny,Sharon and Ray’s cabins are well known in the area (including by taxis!) and are located in beautiful Seppeltsfield. Not fancy but perfect for a little getaway. Cleaners hadn’t arrived but Sharon was able to move us into a different unit so good solution after a long hot day.  Super quiet location but you share an adjacent wall with another cabin so that is to be considered.
16519738,129446218,2017-01-30,37008403,Nathan,"Old Mill Cottage in Kapunda is a beautiful place to stay. We were surprised how historic the cottage was, being built in 1864! It has since been beautifully renovated. It provided us with a great base for both Clare Valley and Barossa."

16519738,151733692,2017-05-14,83193385,Kathleen,"We really enjoyed our stay at Old Mill Cottage, the place itself is private and quiet and has a cosy feel. The cottage was well presented and clean, and the heating facilities are good as there is both a wall heater and a cast iron fire to light up for extra heat and ambience. Yvonne was helpful and quick to respond to all our needs. She was also able to provide us with a portacot which was a bonus. The kitchen doesn't have an oven, but has everything else required to cook family meals. The master bed is very comfy, with lovely soft bedding! All in all this is a very nice little hideaway, only 20 mins drive from tons of big name wineries. "
16519738,153365674,2017-05-21,69949008,Josh,"The cottage was beautifully renovated with quirky themes. My partner needed more than 10 (Hidden by Airbnb) s to cover all the things she liked about the design. 
It was very comfortable and made for a lovely weekend away from Adelaide. "

The garden smells dreamy - with all the blossoming flowers we were just enjoying wonderful wine whilst sitting outside! I would recommend this place to anyone, we also booked a wine tour and they picked us up and dropped back at the cottage which was lovely. Thank you"

Kapunda is so close to everything, the garden is a gorgeous spot to sit in the sun and relax with a wine and enjoy a BBQ. It was still cool at nights so we sat by the wood fire inside and chatted. We had dinner one night at the Kapunda North Hotel which was also amazing. 
A coffee machine would be a great addition to the kitchen and some extra pillows would also be good."

16519738,216446820,2017-12-03,159800594,Luke,"We had a lovely stay at the Old Mill Cottage. With the way the Cottage was decorated, we felt like we stepped back in time, but the bathroom and kitchen renovation provided the comfort of the modern day. It was clean, comfortable and welcoming. It was such a pretty place to stay in, and the welcome of eggs, butter, bread, milk and juice was just so special after weeks of being on the road. The Old Mill Cottage was in a convenient location to check out Kapunda and the other towns in the Barossa Valley. We would highly recommend a stay here :)"
16519738,224945489,2018-01-04,69455935,Sarah,"Great place, tucked away on a quiet street, next to what looks like a reserve. We came on a very hot day and the air-con was super efficient. Loved the old stone walls & polished floorboards combined with a modern kitchen and bathroom. If you're after a large claw-footed bath to soak in and dream away the day, this is the place!"

A 15 min drive to the Barossa and a scenic 50 min drive to the Clare - it's in a great location. The place itself was easy to find, clean and well designed. We were very happy with out stay here - the beautiful outdoor area was perfect to sit back and relax with a glass of wine after exploring all day. Would definitely recommend! Thanks, Yvonne :)"

The breakfast provisions were plenty for a hearty start to our day.
The decor is quirky and interesting "

16519738,336086643,2018-10-14,28903316,Palash,"Snuck into the Barossa for a friday wedding and booked this cottage without any hassle. The place was easy to find, easily accessible and very very clean inside. It had all that was needed (and more) including linen, towels, some breakfast supplies, toilet paper, wood for burning (if thats your thing), books, DVDs, a TV and a portacot. My wife was a huge fan of the supplied marmalade. The shower and bath is a cracker, and the hot water system is quick and excellent. 

The location was outstanding with a reserve next door (including a large pond with plenty of ducks to see) and a nearby park 3 min walk away with a full size steam locomotive to play on - these were appreciated by my 2 year old daughter. Overall the place was great and I'd highly recommend booking it if you wanted to base yourself in Kapunda for a barossa trip. We ended eating at the North Kapunda Pub and FermentAsian which I highly recommend.

The place itself is great - and I have given it 5 stars. However if there was anything negative to note about the place, then its the following:
- there is a tiny tiny amount of termite damage on one doorway - but this doesnt effect your stay
- there are not many fly screens on the windows - so if you're keen to open up the windows and doors and let the breeze through you may need to be aware that bugs may join you inside.

Overall a lovely cottage"
16519738,341831103,2018-10-28,57997969,Mads,would highly recommend the Old Mill cottage. Such a cosy and clean place with great amenities and space. GREAT VALUE!
16519738,405911341,2019-01-27,132154544,Jerome,Lovely old cottage with great charm in a good location with a beautiful lake literally at the backdoor where the ducks and geese can be fed. Good amenities. Aircon in kitchen couldn't really cool the bedroom sufficiently for us.
16595832,143020102,2017-04-09,9764230,Wennie,"Fantastic place! Annelise is an amazing host and nothing was ever too much trouble. The house was fully equip with anything you need. Great place, would love to come back and stay again. "

16595832,149985853,2017-05-06,52967313,Matthew,"Our stay here was absolutely amazing. We were in Adelaide for a wedding and we were a group of 9. The house easily accommodated us with plenty of beds and space. There were plenty of amenities to keep us all entertained and help to get us ready for our wedding. 

On top of the beautiful, clean and modern home. Annelise and Lee provided us with the best service, comparable to that you would find at a 5-star hotel. Some lovely and thoughtful surprises on arrival. I'll keep them a surprise so when others come and visit they can experience what we did. Lee and Annelise also provided transport from the home to our venue which greatly helped as it made our stay even smoother without the stress of having to organise transport. 

Overall the house was already amazing on it's own but the service provided made our stay that much more memorable and allowed us to relax, we really felt that we were taken care of.  Several of our team commented that it was ""the best air bnb that they've been in"" 

100% recommend this for bigger groups looking for a relaxing getaway in a beautiful part of the world or for families. We will all return in our own time definitely!"
16595832,159907720,2017-06-12,85210674,Lauren,Annelise's house is beautiful. So many added extras such as the spa and games cupboard. The surprise treats upon arrival were a lovely added touch. Highly recommend!
16595832,161406966,2017-06-18,111053415,Alana,"Annelise was a gracious and highly attentive hosts. Any issues (not that there was any), or information we needed, we were able to contact her with almost instant replies. The house was beautiful and accommodated a family of 5 (with three young adults) excellently. The complimentary wines, gourmet food platter and even an extra night made this trip the perfect getaway for our otherwise always  busy family. Would definitely return and recommend to all others. Well worth it! So thank you Annelise "
16595832,166618102,2017-07-04,133092463,Chris,"The house is in a great location in the Barossa valley and has access to a wide range of entertainment in the house, no matter how old or young, for the times when you decide to stay indoors.

16595832,179180122,2017-08-07,4661143,Alison,"Thanks so much Annelise.
The most amazing house for 9 adults and 2 children to stay. The family's from
Overseas said they had never seen a house that big and beautiful before. Everything we needed and was there waiting for us. The kids loved their little gift and us adults loved our wine and cheese platter. We will definitely return, hopefully when it's not raining and don't chicken out using the jacuzzi.
Thanks again 10/10"
16595832,183671026,2017-08-18,4863855,Hiro,"It was just a great decision to stay at Annelise's beautiful home with my two other colleagues instead of staying at a hotel. Everything about it was great, from her prompt communication to handing us the key where we were for a business meeting to finding a nice cheese plate and local goodies like bacon and eggs and artisanal butter, etc. for us to enjoy! It was a most stunning Airbnb experience, obviously the best ever for me so far! I would love to come back and definitely with more friends for more than one night."
16595832,184488697,2017-08-19,21302286,Elizabeth,"Perfect house for a great weekend away - we had eight girls and a baby and had all the space and amenities we needed and then some. Annelise went above and beyond to provide us with welcome treats, tips on the local area, baby gear, and checked in during our stay to make sure everything was OK. Highly recommend this house for a cosy getaway with all the perks of home in the heart of the Barossa. Thanks again Annelise, we already can't wait to come back!"

Everything about the house is well thought and so confortable, it make you feel you are in a five star hotel honestly! 
And the jacuzzi.... we could not find a better place, and we recommend this place to all travelers, big or smaller groups it can fit any one !
Thanks a lot to both of you and congratulation for making such a place!
We will definitely come back !!!"
16595832,189189925,2017-09-01,23959019,Jon,"I stayed at Annelise's place with a couple of mates so that we could spend the day enjoying all the fine things the Barossa has to offer. The house was a perfect base, tucked away in a new development in Lyndoch. Lee met us when we checked in and gave us a tour around the house. The fridge was stocked with local produce for breakfast as as well a having a continental selection on the breakfast bar. After a busy day, we all enjoyed a soak in the hot tub.
This place would be ideal for families with kids as their are plenty of fun games to play in the backyard, such as table tennis and air hockey.
Thanks Annelise, we'd definitely stay again!"

16595832,195572442,2017-09-20,124139347,Mathew,"Annelise proved to be an excellent host who communicated clearly, yet also left us in peace once we arrived. We arrived in the evening and the house was well lit with the heater on so it was warm and inviting. Some excellent local wines and produce was provided which again made us feel welcome. This home has plenty of room and we shared with family for a special occasion. We will happily stay here again and we highly recommend this accommodation to anyone looking for a home to stay in the Barossa. Mathew"
16595832,198263563,2017-09-29,6834547,Adam,"Large and comfortable house which was a perfect base for exploring the Barossa Valley and nearby areas in addition to the Adelaide Hills.  The 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom house is spacious and would suit groups of all sizes.

Easy to find and although it is in the quiet town of Lyndoch, it is a short drive from nearby cafes and wineries and other areas like Tanunda and Gawler.

Annelise was a great host, continually offering value adds and lots of information which helped make our stay easy and enjoyable.

Annelise was prompt in responding to any questions we had and we highly recommend this house for anyone wanting to explore the Barossa Valley."

Any questions or information we needed were promptly responded to and we had no worries throughout our stay."

Absolutely perfect - great location, facilities and outstanding hospitality with those thoughtful touches of wine and food!

Definitely recommended for anyone staying in the area."

She was only a message or phone call away with any questions that I had and amenable to requests re check in. It was lovely after a day out to return to a spa ready to go and wine and nibbles. Overall, a very relaxing and comfortable experience. If we could've only checked out a little later it would have been absolutely perfect! "
16595832,261762289,2018-05-07,9134436,Tom,"Annelise’s House is a beautiful home, the welcome touches are really well though get out and helped make our stay an absolute pleasure. We were two ping families, and Annelise was only too happy to accommodate us by providing two travel cots and two high chairs.  There were lots of toys for the kids, and we even found time for a little dip in the spa!

I’d highly recommend staying here, and we really hope to return one day, thanks for helping us have a great weekend in the barossa "

16595832,274687024,2018-06-10,25834586,Rochelle,Absolutely beautiful home with all the amenities you need and more! The smallest details were thought of and for a group travelling with young ones this helped create a home away from home for our boys while the spa gave us mum’s and dad’s a “day spa at home” experience once the kids were asleep! Perfect!

Something for everyone here and in particular, something for kids of all ages. My son enjoyed playing with some new toys! The added touch of food for breakfast and a couple of bottles of wine on arrival were awesome. Annelise was an attentive host, quick to respond, and was able to provide everything we needed to make our stay with our little one stress free (including ensuring a baby monitor was made available for us!). The spa: perfect! The location: great for exploring the different areas of Barossa. Will definitely recommend to others and if we come back, will stay here!"

It is an extremely family friendly house with great extras like playroom with books, games and toys.

We enjoyed the spa and extra touches like breakfast basket with milk and spreads in the fridge, plus a bottle of bubbly. I would recommend staying here."

It is a great location for exploring the Barossa. The house itself is very spacious and so well equipped, it had everything we needed and more. We really appreciated the lovely little touches from Annelise such as the bottle of bubbly and the delicious breakfast provided. The outdoor space is great for meals/drinks and we enjoyed relaxing in the hot tub after a day of wine tasting. Thanks so much Annelise, we would highly recommend your home and equally would love to come and stay again."
16595832,420177886,2019-03-05,3891508,Georgie,"The best Airbnb experience! Travelled as two couples and enjoyed the table tennis, plenty of board games and indulgent breakfasts. We loved staying in this beautiful, family home."

16693931,128997716,2017-01-28,5631849,Cameron & Angie,"Go-go's was perfect for our stay in Eden Valley. It was much more spacious than we expected, and lovely evenings were spent in the cool breezes on the front verandah after long days exploring and wine tasting. It had everything we needed and the general store and pub were just down the road. It was super quiet, perfect for star gazing at night, and was wonderful to wake up to the sunrise and birds in the morning. Karine and Michael were great hosts and we'll definitely be back again. Thank you!"
16693931,136031269,2017-03-07,61327287,Ian,"Fantastic, comfortable and homely place to stay in Eden Valley, close to Barossa region. Clean, tidy and spacious. Lovely to sit on front verandah and listen to the birds. Especially loved how well equipped it was, even with supplies in the fridge and pantry, which was great as interstate travellers. Recommended"
16693931,136995201,2017-03-12,113435339,Susan,"My husband and our two friends just spent 4 nights in this fantastic accomodation. Everything was perfect from the spacious clean house to the host ""Karines' most knowledgable and local tips. Thank you. We can't wait to come back again as soon as possible. "
16693931,144896767,2017-04-16,121452039,Linna,"The property is set on a reasonably quiet road, located near some nice wineries a short (5 - 30 minute) drive away. The rooms are clean and spacious and looked better than they did in the photos. The kitchen was well equipped, including a stocked pantry with all the basics. The single bathroom and separate toilet worked out alright for four adults. The host was very friendly and helpful (and also environmentally conscious, which was a bonus).  Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay and would consider staying there again. A few things that did not really bother us but may be worth noting for some guests are (i) there is no internet access and we had Optus network on our mobiles. The mobile connection dropped in and out a fair bit during our stay. Not sure if other networks would be better in the area. We had a GPS and did most of our research before the trip so it did not bother us; (ii) the house was very clean but perhaps given the season (autumn) we found a number of caterpillar-looking worms inside the house. We were not bothered but just had to watch where we put our steps when walking around the house; (iii) the TV signal was very weak on two of the three nights, with only one channel working. Again we were not bothered as we did not go to Eden Valley to watch TV but if you would like to stay in one night and put a show on for the kids then it would be tricky as there is no internet or DVD player. Overall it was a lovely stay at Go Go. Thank you Karine."
16693931,147456050,2017-04-26,116329651,Rob,A great retreat.  We loved the space for kids to play and a sense of being away from the business of life.
16693931,161424912,2017-06-18,3852768,Wilmie,"Go Go's was great, we had absolutely everything we needed and more. Excellent location - we were so happy we picked Eden Valley to stay and even happier with Go Go's. It was right in the middle of so many great wineries and other places to visit and really comfortable and well set up for relaxing after a busy day of sight seeing. "
16693931,162668004,2017-06-22,135424489,Amy,Thanks for having us!

16693931,205308587,2017-10-22,54288921,James,"Set in the picturesque Eden Valley, Go's Go's is a great base to explore the Barossa Valley. The house is extremely spacious and has all the amenities, including a fully stocked pantry, for a no hassle stay. Host Karine is extremely helpful and prompt with responses to questions/requests. Overall, very good value."
16693931,209248895,2017-11-05,37354186,Justin,The house was excellent and very clean. Karine was very friendly and hospitable. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Karine!

16693931,212699346,2017-11-19,135338006,Ron,"Although we only spent two night's at Go Go's we were very impressed with the location and amenities, The rooms were spacious and tidy. The surrounds were well kept and it was pleasing to wake up to the sounds of country wildlife. The atmosphere was typical of Peace and Tranquility and very relaxing. The location  is within close reach of many wineries and the larger towns of the Barossa Valley. The hosts are a young couple who were very keen to please and ensure and ensure our stay was an enjoyable one. Thanks to Michael and Karine."
16693931,221241503,2017-12-26,158506485,Chris,"A fantastic place to stay. The house is clean and spacious with plenty of natural light through large windows. The rooms are large which is an added bonus when 2 toddlers are in tow and is well stocked from a pantry/amenities perspective. Set on a sizeable piece of land, there is plenty of space for outside play. The birdlife in the early morning and late of an evening was just wonderful to hear. While Eden Valley doesn't have a general store, this is easily countered by some forward planning. All in all, thoroughly recommended - a wonderful few days were spent here."
16693931,221817578,2017-12-27,103252146,Divya,Karine was an amazing host. The house was beautifully presented with a lovely backyard and all amenities also extremely clean. Could not ask for more.
16693931,224346517,2018-01-02,1123245,Dasha,"The place was great, very well equipped, we had everything we needed and more ( we were traveling with two young boys and grandma). It was clean, communication was great, we were welcomed with all basic groceries like bread, eggs and great wine :-) as we arrived late. Great location - lot to see around or in Adelaide and Glenelg village. Stay at least 3 nights to experience it all and visit some vineyards too :-)."
16693931,240486513,2018-03-04,138805060,Bernadette,"It was exactly what we were looking for. The friendly touch like a fresh loaf of bread, flowers and a well stocked pantry were certainly very much appreciated.

16693931,257916041,2018-04-28,16224405,Mark,"We had a lovely couple of nights at Karine's place with my parents and our two kids. It was easy to check in and the communications prior with Karine were quick and accurate. 

The place itself is located well, short drive to Fernfield Winery and easy reach to Henschke and the heart of the Barossa only a scenic drive of 15/20min away.

The house was clean and surprisingly well stocked pantry. We cooked at home for a night and whilst the place is of a certain age, everything works well including the heating and hot water in the shower.

Karine has done a great job putting some nice personal touches throughout the house and the real party piece is the garden, which is fantastic to just look out over and have the kids run around to chase the morning rabbits.

Thank you for letting us stay."
16693931,360001560,2018-12-19,40926607,Lester,"This home is a very stylish and well-organised. Karine did a wonderful job as the host and made sure our stay was as comfortable as possible.

16795559,135395249,2017-03-04,113341642,Leah,"The cottage at Buckbury End farm is situated on a picturesque property. Beautiful country breezes, an outlook of peppercorn trees and gums and a gorgeously appointed cottage await.

The cottage is lovely - has everything you need and really sets the scene for some excellent R&R! A perfect getaway for those wanting to be surrounded by nature and not too far from wineries and attractions! 
16795559,137859785,2017-03-17,11668133,Julie,"John's place had absolutely everything you could want. We even saw a kangaroo close by while we had our breakfast - a must for overseas visitors. The attention to detail in the cottage was well appreciated, as was the peace and quiet. A special place. Highly recommended."
16795559,138075399,2017-03-18,115721708,Carmel,"Located on a farm, but still very handy to all the scenic and tourist attractions of the Barossa. A lot of love and care has gone into restoring an authentic slice of Barossa architecture. Gives you the opportunity to experience a stone cottage but with all the mod-cons. Fabulous!"
16795559,138851878,2017-03-21,28088758,Julie,"Wow if you want country - you have it here!  Location just a little out of town but very easy to find when you follow the instructions given by John.  Ample food for breakfast, bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, bread, yogurt, fruit, juice and all the condiments necessary.  The very new and modern kitchen is equipped with all the mod cons.  Top quality cookware, crockery etc...  This farm cottage has been decked out with exceptional detail...lovely linen too.

We arrived and I was reading when husband went out to explore, next thing I recive a phone call from my husband to come and join him. I find him with John (our Host) and there they were beers in hand having a right old talk, I was then handed a drink myself.  Now that is what I call a host and country hospitality.  John is in the process of renovating the main farmhouse - an enormous job - we look forward to coming back in 5 years ? 10 perhaps? :) Great stay...thank you"

My husband and I stayed there for 3 days for our anniversary and we would definitely stay there again. The bed is very comfortable, the shower is nice, the kitchen has everything you could need. There is a TV, however there is no Wi-Fi. John has left little treats everywhere - breakfast, chocolates, magazines, toiletries, BBQ, etc. The location is great - close to all the wineries but far enough for peace and quiet. There's even a stream you can walk to on the property."

16795559,153851291,2017-05-22,632928,Chuck,"This place is extremely close to everything in the Barossa, but very secluded. Charming home, very private, and more views and birds than we ever expected.

John's done a wonderful job of setting up this little getaway to feel like a home away from home. It's gorgeous on a nice day, and super cosy and comfy in bad weather. We were totally left to enjoy the space in peace, and appreciated the generous fridge contents and personal touches of the property. John was a great communicator and kept us apprised of a road closure that was to occur during our stay meaning we could plan around it and make the most of our time. We will be recommending it to others. Thanks again!"

The property itself was so lovely and peaceful. My husband and I enjoyed a walk down to the creek and wildlife spotting. We would have loved to go down there for a picnic with the provided bag, but it was 42 degrees so we stayed in! John’s communication was super efficient too. He was always so fast to respond to my questions, and was able to facilitate us arriving early, with the air conditioning on waiting for us!
The property feels very remote, but is actually only 15-20 minutes from major Barossa towns. We were able to have a winery tour pick us up from there and also a taxi driver drop us off with no problems at all. 
An amazing stay overall! Thanks so much John!"

We loved the location as it felt remote, but was only an hour to Adelaide and a couple of minutes from some great Barossa winery’s. I’d recommend booking a winery tour through Getaway tours as you can be collected from the gate. We’ll be back and I’d highly recommend the cottage to others looking for an awesome weekend away."

16795559,295112019,2018-07-23,40236354,Harriet,Cannot recommend this wonderful cottage enough. John was so accommodating with our stay and the thoughtful details made our stay very comfortable and memorable.
16795559,298070884,2018-07-29,48097451,Paul,Amazing country retreat.
16795559,305761304,2018-08-11,31187252,Scott,"Thanks to John (and his parents) for the stay on the farm. We had a ball, sans children, and all the amenities we could wish for. Cheers. Scott and Kathy"
16795559,309179980,2018-08-17,13376433,Tristan,"John's cottage is a spectacular spot for a getaway, stylishly kitted out with everything you could possibly need. Ideal for an escape, you'd never guess the nearest town is just 15 minutes away. Thanks John!"
16795559,315062394,2018-08-28,47429019,Jesse,Really enjoyed our stay. Was a little disappointed to have to provide our own firewood for the fireplace (and only found this out on the morning of check in) but aside from that we had a fantastic time and would highly recommend.
16795559,316246237,2018-08-31,94699866,Megan,"I really do not want to do this because I believe it is  a wonderful secret of the Barossa and I do not want to share...but to be fare this is one of the best Airbnb experiences I have had...and I have used Airbnb quite a lot in the past few years. 
The cottage is set back from Johns property and is very private with a lovely out look onto a garden and the farm its self. The attention to special details is amazing and the cottage has absolutely every thing you could possibly need to make your stay completely self sufficient. It is close to many wineries and Tanunda. 
I have no hesitation in recommending this property for couples who need a getaway from their busy lives. 
Thanks so much John for making us feel very welcome"
16795559,317217494,2018-09-02,113784576,Amber,Our stay at Johns was a very enjoyable one. Cosy little cottage about 15 minutes out from Tanunda on a beautiful farm. One of the best airbnbs I have stayed in. Will be recommending to friends and family!
16795559,320433763,2018-09-09,203852974,Gillian,Such a great little cottage with everything you need for a comfortable weekend away. We loved it!
16795559,324400382,2018-09-17,189425802,George,A great studio cottage for a couple looking for a quiet time off the beaten track and away from the hustle and bustle. Most enjoyable. Johns little extras are certain to please.
16795559,326730306,2018-09-23,33166631,Marnie,Perfect little getaway cottage on a beautiful farm! Johns hospitality was excellent too! We really enjoyed our stay and will defiantly be back.

16795559,331205664,2018-10-02,100323658,Laraine,"The farm cottage at Buckberry End Farm is delightful, very comfortable and well set up.
It's situated in beautiful and peaceful countryside. We enjoyed walking down to the river each afternoon.
This is a great venue to stay and explore all that the Barossa Valley has to offer.
We'll be recommending this venue to our friends."
16795559,333141798,2018-10-07,156015689,Kathryn,"We stayed at this beautiful little cottage for our anniversary weekend and it was perfect. John was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and even let us have a late check out as there was no one staying immediately after us. It was a great location, very quiet and secluded but still easy to get where we needed to go around the Barossa. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a couple of nights away!"
16795559,338937818,2018-10-20,102171559,Barbara,"This dear little cottage stole our hearts.  The pictures don't do it justice.  Rustic with all the mod cons, very comfy,  very clean  and the  most generous provisions  EVER!!  The flowers  were lovely and the  attention to detail was amazing,  everything was  thought of. The views outside are spectacular especially in the mornings and when the sun is setting. We enjoyed sitting on the porch and wandering down to the creek for  drinks and picnics. We loved seeing the animals and sharing our apples with the horse and pony. The roads around the property and in the area have gorgeous vineyards and olive groves to feast your eyes on as well.   John is very friendly and  available if you need anything but also very discreet, leaving you to  your privacy. Tips: Chateau Barossa's garden was really nice and their leek and chicken pie with mash was delish! Seven hills winery and tour in Clare Valley is really worth a visit on a sunny day as is the Lavender farm. The drive there from Lydoch is gorgeous and going to Parson's lookout on Trial rd as you turn right from the Lavender farm, not to be missed. Mintaro is very cute and charming  (and small) if you like old English type villages.  The ""Co Op: shop is amazing. We were drooling over all the cheese! We loved our time in the Barossa and the accommodation was an absolute delight and hightlight. We will come again! Thank you John :))"
16795559,341818967,2018-10-28,194772935,Claire,Nice clean cottage on the door step of the Barossa. It was lovely and quite with lots of birds. Loved our time there.

16795559,346003334,2018-11-07,14729834,Lincoln,"If you’re considering staying here then do not hesitate. We have no improvements to suggest! We stayed here with our five month old daughter for three nights and loved every minute. The cottage is lovely and warm, quiet and peaceful. It is kitted out really well with everything you need. It was spotlessly clean. We appreciated greatly that the fridge had been stocked with breakfast and loved that there was a dishwasher, who wants to wash the dishes on holiday!? The farm is lovely will lots of opportunities for walks and wildlife spotting. Thanks John for an excellent stay."
16795559,346788207,2018-11-09,63331085,Catherine,"Beautiful cottage set next to a river with easy walking access.  Very quiet and relaxing space with generous provisions.  Close to the Barossa wineries, wine tour recommended to make the most of the Barossa."

16795559,407693293,2019-02-03,17852842,Sarah,"Perfectly based in the Barossa, John's cottage is one of those dream Airbnbs where everything is considered and well-thought out - with even a pre-packed picnic bag to take down the river and breakfast provided. It was also spotless. I would absolutely recommend this beautiful spot and John's excellent hospitality."
16795559,410199077,2019-02-09,111479682,Victoria,"Wonderful cosy cottage to get away and explore the Barossa. All the small things have been thought about.

Highly recommend it."
16795559,415921909,2019-02-23,17481540,Michaela,"Everything was thoughtfully and generously appointed, with beautiful fixtures and fittings throughout. Very tastefully and thoughtfully appointed, small touches like kitchen and bathroom amenities reflect John’s organisation as a host and contribute to a very positive guest experience. The property is stunning, and the location offers a beautiful slice of farm life. It’s location in the Barossa is handy, as long as you have access to a car.
I recommend John’s place to anyone I know coming through the area and hope to visit myself again too!"
16795559,417953316,2019-02-28,404205,Anja,beautiful cottage and John has thought of everything to make our stay great. such a peaceful and quiet place.
16795559,418697900,2019-03-02,35749732,Judy,"If you are looking for a peaceful get-away in the Barossa Valley, this is the place for you! The cottage is beautifully kitted out and you are lacking for nothing. A lovely breakfast awaits you in the fridge. We arrived on a 40 degree day and John had kindly turned on the air conditioning which was very effective. The property leads down to the river an there is even a picnic set for you to use. Highly recommended."
16795559,420840409,2019-03-08,5396190,Alex,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in Buckberry Farm. The beautiful stone cottage is perfect for some peace and quiet after a long day exploring the Barossa Valley. We just wish we had more time to stay and relax around the property itself. Unfortunately we didn't find time to head down to the river and have a picnic. Overall the place was very homely, clean, comfortable and in close proximity to all the best cellar doors. The breakfast ingredients supplied in the fridge were especially a really nice touch! Would definitely look to stay here again if we return to the Barossa."
16795559,423074853,2019-03-13,207896022,Alexandra,"This is the perfect private retreat , away from traffic, noise....and people. John has thought of everything, from the lovely big towels and amenities to breakfast / nibbles in the fridge. This was a wonderful escape, it was peaceful taking a picnic down to the river and seeing the cows come in to the shed in the evening while having a barbeque, this is the place to be for a lot of serenity!! + Super fast communication and close to vineyards if that's what you are after, thank you John!"
16795559,423692468,2019-03-15,41936579,Susan,"We really enjoyed our stay at Buckbury End Farm. The cottage has the perfect combination of rustic charm and modern amenities. Beautiful location and, though on a working farm, felt quite secluded and private. Perfect to use as a base for wine-tasting in the region, or just enjoying a few days away from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. Would highly recommend."
16795559,426716811,2019-03-22,247122738,Trish,"Great place to stay thank you John for the lovely clean accomodation and the extra special touches of breakfast, flowers and in our case accomodating us with an early check in.  Woudl reccomend"
16795559,427525130,2019-03-23,240930776,Mike,John's place is the perfect spot for those looking for a getaway. It's out of town so make sure you have a car but that the beauty of it. Quite and beautifully appointed we could have spent much more than two nights there relaxing and exploring the Barossa.
16795559,429104205,2019-03-27,96255296,Sue,"This delightful cottage is truly a hidden gem, ideal for a couple to stay one or several nights. There were so many thoughtful touches, including the making of a yummy cooked breakfast or supper. Also, very convenient for all the attractions of the Barossa Valley."
16795559,431828190,2019-04-01,26398567,Katherine,"We have just had the best time staying at this Beautiful cottage. Nice touches like fresh flowers, plush towels, and happy anniversary sign made our holiday feel extra special. We loved the cows and sheep, and spotted some deers on the field across the river. Thank you John. 
Highly recommended."
16795559,434524424,2019-04-08,13122741,Alana,Beautiful cottage in the Barossa for a  secluded getaway. John has thought of all the little things you need for your stay. The cottage has so much character! Would definitely stay again. Loved it.
16795559,436845983,2019-04-14,8862423,Haylee,"John and Jess were awesome hosts, super quick on replies and really homely touches in the house. Coffee, tea, milk, breaky supplies. The farm was fantastic; felt remote but was only a 25 min to the town centre and wonderful wineries. We had a great time!"
16795559,438511904,2019-04-17,49671366,Jenni,What a way to complete your Barossa experience. It was so beautiful waking up surrounded by farm life and finishing the day with a picnic on the banks of the river. John went out of his way to make our sister holiday getaway extra special by including a happy birthday sign. We couldn’t recommend this little cottage more. Thank you
16999402,142625414,2017-04-09,19551048,Anne,"We had a lovely stay at Fiona's unique B and B. It's a wonderfully spacious room with a exceptional private bathroom. We really loved the breakfast goodies that Fiona had prepared and were very spoilt to have fresh coffee delivered to our doorstep by Fiona the next morning. We also enjoyed Fiona's friendliness and delightful tour of her amazing place (an historic former winery). This B and B is an absolute 'must stay' if you are in the Barossa region and Fiona is a superb host who was able to give us lots of information about wine, wineries and places to eat in the area. Our only disappointment was that we couldn't stay longer. We would certainly recommend this unique B and B to anyone visiting the Barossa region!"
16999402,146447691,2017-04-23,6958116,Monica,"Great place! More like a studio apartment than a private room. I'd definitely stay again; in fact I would live there if it had a stove :)!

Beautiful space, we spent a long time drinking wine in the lovely (private) sitting area. Super comfy bed and amazing shower. It's a beautiful building and home and the room is essentially as private as you want it to be. It's really a place to behold!

We enjoyed a flat white in the garden area in the morning. I wish we could have stayed longer! Fiona was incredibly nice and welcoming, and so were her dog and cat (which were not forced upon us in any way, in case you don't like animals).

Walking distance to the local pub/eatery so you can enjoy a pint without having to drive."
16999402,159384215,2017-06-11,106761265,David,"Wonderful room in a great old winery. Lovely breakfast provided in the morning: fresh bread, cereal, coffee and tea. Very accommodating and friendly host Fiona who has a great knowledge of the area and surrounding Barossa Valley. "
16999402,171841958,2017-07-19,20419222,David,"We had a very pleasant one-night stay in Fiona's lovely B&B, which is located in the back of an old winery building.  It is very comfortable and well equipped.
Fiona provided clear instructions for finding the location, and we were met by her neighbour Bevan, who briefed us on the B&B arrangements and showed us around the old winery building.
Fiona's B&B is an ideal base for anyone (single or couple) touring the South Australian wine regions."
16999402,177770070,2017-08-04,135600121,Michelle,"Very friendly and welcoming, quite an interesting architectural layout. Pub is close by, Yalumba up the road and we also went into Angaston (nice Thai food, Chris). Room is big and unusual. Highly recommended."
16999402,187903313,2017-08-28,5125387,Karita,The room was exactly as described. Very comfortable bed and had everything we needed. We spent 2 night's at Fiona's B&B whilst visiting the Barossa Valley Wineries. Fiona also gave us a few very good suggestions of where to visit whilst we were in town. We would definitely stay here again.
16999402,189797472,2017-09-03,4494806,Cristina,"We had a wonderful weekend. Fiona and her husband were warm and welcoming. The house is truly unique and has been done up to be quite cosy. A great place to explore Barossa, highly recommended! Thanks for having us! :)"
16999402,199422313,2017-10-01,64477953,Noel,"Fiona's place is ideal for absolute rest and recreation - do as much , or as little as you like and enjoy the unique setting. Located at the rear of a large heritage listed building the B&B offers as much privacy as needed ,however Fiona is always available with any assistance that may be required - she is the perfect hostess , always helpful but never intrusive. The huge accommodation space with its period furniture and modern bathroom addition has a much appreciated comfort factor - the same as the pleasant and colourful garden surrounds. 
A visit to the nearby ( easy walking distance ) hotel for dinner is a must - well priced, excellent food mixed with a great group of locals who made us more than welcome on Grand Final day."
16999402,205843036,2017-10-22,90499579,Julia,"A wonderful stay, better than we could've imagined. A fantastic welcoming host. It was lovely to share, time, wine, stories and recommendations, with you and Bevan.

A special unique suite within an old winery steeped in local history. We loved:
- the special tour of the property
- Bevan's mum's apricot jam
- locally sourced breakfast 
   bread & produce
- Eden Valley and it's pub
- Bugs, the wonder dog :-)

Can highly recommend Fiona's place to stay and base yourself whilst exploring the Barossa.

We look forward to a 'Catacombs Party' ;-) perhaps in the future."
16999402,210985616,2017-11-12,15850353,Lucienne,"Fiona's place is lovely. As described, it's in a heritage listed old Penfolds building with loads of history, which Fiona told us all about! Great stay and would certainly recommend."
16999402,214408646,2017-11-25,2459274,Ben,"Beautiful location. The room we stayed in is part of an intriguing building that we were lucky to get a tour of from our hosts, and to hear about the history of the place, including the underground brandy storage tanks and original engine room. Very private and quiet, comfy bed, nice antique furniture, tasty local fresh bread and breakfast supplies. Excellent shower and new bathroom facilities. Friendly approachable and promptly available hosts. Very clean. Very good hearing/cooling."
16999402,216043337,2017-12-03,119760843,Alex,Very charming location
16999402,217147523,2017-12-08,6479476,Nils,Very clean and spacious room located in a lovely refurbished mill. Fiona passionately restores antique furniture that she also uses for the rooms. Our booking was very last minute and yet she welcomed us with everything ready for our arrival. She even had artisan bread and homemade jam for our breakfast. This Airbnb experience was definitely special is highly recommended.
16999402,219194412,2017-12-17,159701224,Nadine,"We had a wonderful stay. Fiona is a superb host who offered exemplary hospitality, flexibility, attention to detail and a genuine willingness to accomodate our needs. The room and courtyard has a lovely old world French chateau feel about it. Loved the eclectic style! And that fresh bread on arrival!! Yum!! Quiet and unassuming, perfect for relaxing slightly off the beaten track. We would definitely go back."
16999402,222456662,2017-12-29,907777,Karyn,"A unique and comfortable space with all the comforts of home: comfortable bed, luxurious bathroom, amazing art, thoughtfully decorated with old world charm, comfortable seating and the added interest of staying in a converted area of the former Penfolds winery in the middle of the Barossa Valley.
Fiona is an amazing host providing thoughtful touches to enhance our stay: welcome chocolates, fruit, beautiful local bread and enough milk, coffee and tea for the duration of our stay, and a substantial breakfast.
 A special touch was leaving a bowl of freshly picked mulberries, with a little note attached, for us on our return from dining at the local pub.
The local pub is a short walk away and catered for our evening meal where we enjoyed a delightful fish soup served with lots of fresh bread. This was great value. The pub is a little step back in time, the owners and locals also being very welcoming.
The Winery is easy to find, the journey from Adelaide through the Barossa Valley to The Winery being both worthwhile and enjoyable. Our trip was between Christmas and New Year and we enjoyed the large red bows decorating the trees and verandah poasts throughout the villages on the way there. This journey affords all the delights that the Barossa may offer. We enjoyed an amazing duck, orange and cranberry pie from a bakery on the way, and purchased amazing affordable cherries from a roadside stall.
I thoroughly recommend Fiona as a host and The Winery as a great place to stay. We will definitely book again if passing this way and recommend The Winery to family and friends."
16999402,223876337,2018-01-02,12971371,Joice,"What a fantastic place to stay! Unique stylish accommodation in a great quiet spot within the Barossa and a very welcoming host. Fiona was kind, helpful and  thoughtful and the many extra nice things she did for us were very much appreciated (tour, bread, fruits etc). Our host and her impressive home made our stay very special indeed."
16999402,225258227,2018-01-05,164750041,Henry,"A generous space as part of a historic home. Fiona was a wonderful host, who not only fitted the room out with everything we needed, but also had great local tips for places to visit."
16999402,227089615,2018-01-13,48046328,Kelly,"We had a wonderful stay at Fionas B&B. The room and amenities were absolutely gorgeous and exactly the vibe we were after going to the Barossa. The hospitality of Fiona and her daughter, Trix, was amazing and Trix took us around to tastings so we could enjoy without worrying about driving. Also enjoyed multiple pats of her gorgeous and friendly pets. Would definitely recommend staying!"
16999402,230747748,2018-01-28,10677219,Emil,"If you are considering Fiona's AirBnB, book it! Seriously, do yourself a favour and book it. 

We had an amazing stay here--the place itself is like a country cottage plucked straight out of Tuscany. It is tastefully decorated with vintage furniture, adding to the look and feel of the space itself. The location is great for exploring the wine regions nearby. 

Fiona is also an amazing host--there were tons of amenities for us, lots of little touches and things that she had thought to leave for us, plus great local advice about wineries around Eden and Barossa."
16999402,238020659,2018-02-25,31714292,Suzi,A wonderful host and lovely place to relax. Thank you for sharing your peaceful & relaxing home with us. We'd happily return!
16999402,239233958,2018-02-28,35250583,Jessie,"Such a wonderful experience, everything we could've asked for and more. Such fabulous hospitality from the moment we arrived. You're not only getting the room but also the opportunity to immerse yourself in such a historical experience. We only stayed for one night but wished we could have stayed some more to exlpore the stunning property. The room itself was spacious with locally sourced food for breakfast. Would highly recommend to everyone."
16999402,239987517,2018-03-03,3262331,Ann,Great spot as a base to explore the Barossa. Everything was as stated and checking in was hassle free. Very well presented and comfortable.

16999402,251396077,2018-04-08,8034950,Annabel,We loved staying in Fiona's lovely roomy spacious accommodation in part of an old winery while we were touring the Barossa.  The room was very comfortable and stylishly quirky in its decoration.  We would highly recommend staying at Fiona's place.
16999402,255217746,2018-04-20,41031342,Lisa,"We stayed at Fiona’s Airbnb for four nights to use as a base to enjoy what the Barossa has to offer. While it was a little distance from the heart of the Barossa, it was an excellent location to drive to and from, with scenic views and cute places to stop. There was actually lots to do around Eden Valley, too, when we did our research. 

Fiona was very hospitable and friendly, and is clearly very knowledgeable about the region and it’s wines. She had included lots of thoughtful touches in the space which made for a very nice stay."

16999402,256535957,2018-04-23,58439750,Tim,A unique space in a lovely setting. The town is small but the people are friendly and the pub is only a few doors away. Fiona was also a gracious hostess.
16999402,257917901,2018-04-28,106326553,Sherridan,Gorgeous room.... high ceilings and great furniture. Shower had good pressure.... a nice continental breakfast. Fiona is a lovely host and respects your space. She has done some amazing furniture restoration and is happy to show you around the property. The Eden Valley Hotel is a 3 minute walk and you’re made feel like a local as soon as you walk in.
16999402,258308809,2018-04-29,99145967,Heather,This accommodation is just perfect for a short stay - ours was an overnight after attending a wedding in the area. We felt like we were in the French countryside - our room was beautifully appointed with lovely furnishings and  original paintings. Fiona allowed us early access to dress for the wedding which we really appreciated. Thank you again Fiona. We are telling our friends and hopefully they may also one day enjoy your hospitality.
16999402,260151764,2018-05-03,174330271,Beryl,Warm and inviting room in the small township of Eden Valley. Nice touch of fruit and good choices for Breakfast options. Internet worked well. Nice pub close by for dinner and local flavour. We would be happy to stay again should the opportunity arise. Very happy to recommend to others.

The accommodation was extremely well appointed with a gorgeous continental breakfast included and special touches like fresh fruit and chocolates.  Comfy bed and great water pressure in the shower.  Fiona was a great host too - efficient in her responses and there to check us in. Thanks for a lovely stay.
16999402,277634463,2018-06-17,72658947,Samantha,"Friendly and thoughtful host. The room was beautiful, private and relaxed place to stay. Cute garden. Short walk to a great local pub for a meal. We had a great night away!"
16999402,286728359,2018-07-07,987662,Susan,"Fiona is a warm and welcoming host. The room is beautifully appointed, comfortable and clean and we appreciated the special touches in the room, flowers and a fruit bowl and quality, delicious breakfast provisions. We stayed during a cold spell but the room was toasty warm. The garden and courtyard are lovely and Fiona gave us a tour of the unique building. Fiona gave us helpful information about the local area, places to eat, visit and good cellar doors. We highly recommend staying at Fiona's beautiful room in Eden Valley and we will definitely be back. "
16999402,289681954,2018-07-13,14218024,Alexi,"A lovely place and a great base to explore Eden Valley/the Barossa. While it isn't in the centre of the Barossa this makes it an even more special getaway away from tourists (and tourist pricing!) and it is still very convenient. 

Everything in the place was of a very high quality, loved the comfy bed and sheets.

The pub is only a few doors up and does lovely good value meals in a friendly atmosphere."
16999402,292372451,2018-07-18,9265212,Karina,"Fabulous space! And we loved being within walking distance to the local little pub for dinner and half an hour drive got us to the other side of the Barossa, so anybody looking to explore this region this is the place to stay. A special thank you to our host Fiona who was absolutely lovely. I highly recommend this place."
16999402,302670975,2018-08-06,50662325,Alwin,"Fiona is the most amazing host. This was our favorite Airbnb that we have ever stayed at. It’s in an old winery and flour mill. It’s an amazing group of buildings and the apartment we stayed in was spacious, clean, and decorated with antiques. There were some simple breakfast options in the room: bread, granola, milk and orange juice, and some tea and instant coffee. The shower is great and there is lots of parking space. Fiona showed us around the grounds and she has a wonderful dog and cat; neither of them come into the apartment, so it’s not a problem if you’re allergic. Fiona lives next door and is readily available for any questions or help. Both the bed and pull-out couch were great for sleeping in and the heating work really well in the winter. We will definitely be back and highly recommend this place!"
16999402,317246501,2018-09-02,155849288,Angela,"A unique and very comfortable BnB, perfect for exploring Eden Valley wineries and region an very close to the Barossa. Fiona was very prompt communicating and gave us a lot of local information."
16999402,320491567,2018-09-09,78242472,Caoimin,Beautiful little hidden gem in an old winery. The room was huge with really nice furniture and fittings. Such a nice feel about it.

The space is incredible, one of the most unique homes I have stayed in.  Beautiful high ceilings, lovely sunny courtyard to eat breakfast in, and a relaxed host. A lovely way to visit a beautiful area."

16999402,361897646,2018-12-24,14532058,Joanna,"Phenomenal stay with Fiona, cannot recommend this place highly enough. Beautiful room, thoughtful touches, cosy yet stylish Fiona thinks of everything. Super easy check-in, greeted on arrival, very flexible. If you are in the area, you HAVE to stay here. Stayed up chatting into the evening with Fiona and her friend on Christmas Eve after a great wine tour. She even very generously offered to have us for Christmas Lunch and spent time showing us her wonderful home. Thank you for a fantastic stay Fiona!❤"
16999402,365922760,2019-01-01,39299408,Caitlin,"This is such a great, quirky place!  My partner and I chose this place because it looked like a unique experience.  We weren't wrong.  The room is brilliantly furnished and the bed super comfy.  Lots of great decorative touches if you love antiques.  Fi spent a lot of time with us, showing us around the whole property and explaining its history.  We felt very much at home.  And the sourdough bread and spreads was a lovely touch for brekkie.  We will definitely be back next time we visit the area."

17123473,135369703,2017-03-04,65524735,Siddharth,Great hosts! Made us feel at home with her hospitality. I had an interesting conversation  with Juliane with just about everything from county living to world affairs. Her husband David is great with wines too :). 
17123473,140580264,2017-03-30,43212233,( Beeva ),"Julianne and David are fantastic host's and there home was amazing place to be in. I would definitely recommend this to everyone who wants that place just a little  out of the city, but close enough to everything. Not far from the Barrosa or city if you have a car. Take a drive up Green Valley RD or take the B10 from Tea Tree  Gully. If you need time out to chill and take in a bit of country life this is it. Pub, shops 10 min down road. Dave knows his wines and can teach you a thing or two but nothing goes past the   (Cook) Julianne. The house is immaculate   and I felt at home and had a wonderful time here. I would recommend this to all future guest's"
17123473,142199565,2017-04-07,123566939,Lena,"Julienne och David är det perfekta värdparet - väldigt omtänksamma och trevliga, glada och mycket hjälpsamma och tillmötesgående! Gården var en oas för den som föredrar lugn! "
17123473,142382660,2017-04-07,123566939,Lena,Julienne and David are the best hosts you can have! They showed great hospitality and made us feel at home as soon as we got there. Really the best you can get! I am sure that no one would be dissapointed staying with them. 
17123473,144952367,2017-04-16,10019744,Jennifer,"Julianne and David's hospitality was above anything we could have ever imagined. Still new to staying in people's homes whilst they are there, we were warmly welcomed with food, wine and lots of friendly conversation. We'd strongly recommend a stay here, beautiful and very relaxing. "
17123473,146177738,2017-04-21,26508708,Jacqui,"Julianne and David are very warm and generous hosts. I cannot recommend staying at their place highly enough, their hospitality and property are beautiful. "
17123473,149188469,2017-05-03,2228161,Dany,"Julianne and her husband are wonderful hosts. We stayed just for a night (and also were a bit unorganised being last minute as we were on the road passing through and needed somewhere to rest). Very quick to reply, accommodating, warm and welcoming. They make you feel instantly at home and have so many interesting stories! We had dinner and breakfast cooked for us and a showcase and mini tour of their batch of wine and vineyard -  truly we felt spoilt! Their place is cosy and lovely. A real country cottage feel with a fireplace. The room overlooks the front of their property, is warm even when it was cold outside. It has a comfortable bed and you are provided with everything you need. We definitely will be staying again if we pass through. Highly recommend staying!"
17123473,150060371,2017-05-07,28215659,Matt,Julianne and David were wonderful hosts. They welcomed us warmly and shared their stories. We loved seeing the vineyard!

17123473,154974787,2017-05-27,6340657,Susan,"Julianne and David's home is warm and much thought has gone into making their guests comfortable.  There are even fleecy bathrobes to cozy in on a chilly winter night!  It is obvious that they enjoy opening their home to guests and that part of the experience for them is to get to know their guests.  What wonderful and far-ranging conversations we had over breakfasts and dinners, which were a welcome surprise after our pondering of way too many restaurant menus.  If you want the experience of visiting a working vineyard and learning about the care that goes into it, if you are interested in the more scientific side to wine making, if you want to discuss the local flora and/or you just want to make instant friends, this is the place to stay!"
17123473,157890914,2017-06-05,78431754,Rebecca,We had a wonderful stay with Julianne and David. They were ever so welcoming and even wined and dined us. Their home is beautiful. I would highly recommend staying with them to anyone!
17123473,160635610,2017-06-15,4450549,Borislav,"Lovely place in the heart of South Australia's wine country minutes away from Barossa Valley, Eden Valley, Clare Valley and Adelaide Hills and equally lovely hosts who went out of their way to make us feel at home. Both Julianne and David were more than generous with their time giving us the grand tour of their farm and vineyard the grapes of which made Charles Melton's ""The Voice of Angels"" vintage a delectable and incontestable winner. They shared with us their home, company, and food as well as a treasure trove of knowledge about the region's history, wine-making, award-winning vintages, and Aussie indigenous flora and fauna. Spotting wildlife in the vineyard was one of the many delightful surprises we experienced. Kangaroos were grazing and romping around on the farm and did not mind being photographed and going on (Hidden by Airbnb) . Actually, our first up-close-and-personal encounter with a live roo happened on the first day of our visit in Mount Pleasant. Also, we loved being serenaded in the morning by a mellifluous chorus of flamboyantly colored and plumaged native birds. Our plan was to spend just one day, but we loved it so much here that we ended up staying 4 days. A day is merely not enough for a complete immersion in the spirit of this awesome place Down Under. We cannot wait to come back before long and savor the flavor of Barossa Valley and its warm and friendly people."
17123473,165102504,2017-06-30,137553959,Justin,Julianne & David were very hospitable and welcomed me into their home with open arms. It was a shame I didn't have much time to look around the rolling hills where they very fortunately call home.
17123473,193534452,2017-09-14,6680423,Hilary And Kevin,"Julianne's home was set in the most beautiful countryside and surrounded by a wonderful garden full of wildlife. We were greeted with a warm welcome and we shared a lovely meal over a glass of wine, (my first experience) thank you so very much for your hospitality, especially as it was booked at such short notice.
I wish you every success in your Airbnb venture."

Both were absolutely friendly, helpful and open-minded. The communication was easy and great, everything was clean and cozy. 

After showing us their whole vineyard (which is beautiful), they invited us for a delicious home made dinner. We were treated very well and enjoyed every minute. Furthermore, we got great recommendations for our trip.

Thank you for everything - we would definitely come back again!
Already missing your hospitality and the ""Traktor"" ;)

The level of comfort and their hospitality could not be faulted. They are keen to share their extensive knowledge on the region , the environment and the wine industry. A special Airbnb experience."
17123473,333898363,2018-10-08,19432905,Ulla,We had a great experience in Julianne’s and David’s place. They are very easygoing and interesting people to talk with. They work around the vineyard and still have time and interest to their community. Highly recommend.

17123473,338568736,2018-10-20,44748931,Caitlin,"Julianne and David have such a cute little house out in the wine country. Their home is warm, welcoming, and comfortable. Their land is beautiful, set just outside a tiny country town. It is a bit remote, but that wasn't a problem for us with our own car. Seriously, go walk through their vineyards and gardens, it's so peaceful and breathtaking. It really relaxes you! We even saw a kangaroo hop on through :) David gave us a taste of his wine, but we also explored the wineries nearby and had a few tastings. 

Julianne and David were super accommodating and so sweet. We loved staying up chatting with them until we were all too tired to continue. It was much too short of a stay, and we will definitely be back again to stay longer with them! If you're passing through and want an affordable, comfortable, clean, homey-stay in the Barossa Wine Region, definitely book with Julianne and David!"
17123473,348205139,2018-11-12,219058341,Christine,"Outstanding hosts, amazing value, you will not be disappointed. I can’t recommend them highly enough"

17123473,367012949,2019-01-03,231759231,Trevor,"Staying with Julianne and David is very much a 'sharing our home' experience. Their property is located in a beautiful area of the Adelaide Hills/Torrens Valley and you are made to feel like a visiting family member, rather than an air B&B client.

They have an extensive knowledge of their local area and are great tour guides/advisers.  Hearing the story of their property and its history, it's not hard to see why they have such a passion for what they do. 

Highly recommended and we'll certainly stay with Julianne and David again on our next SA trip."

Everything was so wonderful - from my fluffy down comforter and bathrobe, to the interesting conversations, to the views of the vineyards. I just wish I could have stayed longer. The location is awesome- in the Barossa Valley but a little bit off the beaten track. Overall, I can not recommend this place enough. Thank you so much for the incredible hospitality!"
17123473,422755509,2019-03-11,39874133,Tom,What a lovely couple. Julieanne and David were the most caring hosts we've come across. We haven't been in a use of bedroom in a shared house before and were a little unsure how it would be. We were made you feel at home and enjoyed our chats. It was lovely to be on a farm too. Very enjoyable.

From the moment we walked in till the moment we left, it was clear that an incredible amount of care had been taken to provide everything we could possibly need - from milk, coffee and herbal tea to a complementary bottle of wine, fresh figs and strawberries. Not to mention fresh homemade biscuits on departure! 

It's very well positioned as well - a tranquil setting and right in the midst of the best wine region.

I'm already looking forward to my next stag and would highly recommend to anyone exploring the beautiful Barossa. "

We were so well looked after, with some lovely little surprise extras. The breakfast was spot on with homemade granola, yummy bread, fresh strawberries and coffee. The place itself was simple and beautifully presented and it was so lovely to lie in bed with the papers listening to the church bells on Sunday morning. Would highly recommend the hike up the hill to the quarry to take in the views back over Light Pass and the vines... followed by a dip in the pool! We will be back."

Tracy left us delicious homemade cookies and granola and left milk, juice, fruit and wine. There was a coffee maker with coffee pods and tea with fresh lemon from their lemon tree. The property is surrounded by vineyards in the small town of Light  Pass in the northern part of the Barossa Valley. Perfect for exploring. Highly recommended."

When walking into the cottage, we found baked cookies and sour dough bread, freshly prepared granola, fresh strawberries and a bottle of complimentary Yalumba wine. It was a very generous offering, not to mention delicious. The cottage was clean and cosy. Tracy and Matt were friendly and always available for any questions. Tracey even provided us crackers on the last night when we missed our chance to buy them as the local Foodland was closed. Thank you once again for the amazing hospitality. It made our Barossa trip unforgettable!"

Great little kitchenette with bread, granola and coffee included which we had each morning in the yard which was lovely. The two dogs and other family that we met were friendly and we were made to feel welcome. The shed is secluded in a quiet town but is close to Barossa vineyards (cab ride away, which was easy enough). The bed was comfy but very squeaky. The pool was great."

17720616,196662753,2017-09-24,29424189,Joshua,"Cathy was on the ball from the start! Emailing with very easy and clear instructions to get set up with the keyless entry (very cool!). The house is well located, walking distance to shops, eateries and visitors centre. The two mountain bikes saved us lots of money as we did not have to hire from the visitor centre who charge $44 per day per bike. Short drive, or scenic bike ride to Nuriootpa and Angosta with great wineries along the way. Would recommend! Thanks again!"

The house  is very spacious with modern kitchen and generous amenities including bikes if you’d rather ride than walk. There were only two of us but the space could easily accommodate a second couple or family. It also has a lovely backyard space for outdoor meals. Cathy was very responsive to our questions and check in was really east’s We would definitely recommend this space to others.

17721773,235772436,2018-02-17,155081106,Leonie,"A girlfriend and I enjoyed a relaxing long weekend retreat at Somerton House this past weekend. Hosts Natalie and Virginia communicated exceptionally well and very promptly in every instance prior to and during our stay. Although we stayed on a self-contained basis so did not meet them, we found them welcoming, obliging and incredibly helpful - offering suggestions re things to do, places to eat, etc. All the information we might have needed was provided and at hand.  The renovated and extended bungalow has been tastefully furnished in keeping with the original building, but with all the modern comforts. It was impeccably clean and boasts a well-equipped modern kitchen with lots of bench space. Rooms are large, there is a huge double shower in the main bathroom, plus another in the second bathroom where the toilet is. The solar-heated pool and its surrounds were a highlight - I would agree with others that the online photos don’t do the home justice, especially the rear outdoor undercover area, which is spacious and beautifully outfitted. Highly recommended "

The kitchen set up is excellent for those self catering and the nice touches on arrival meant we didn't need to race out grocery shopping the minute we arrived.

You can stroll out for coffee, a wine at the wine bar or at a Taste of Eden or stay in an laze by the pool. Just lovely."
17721773,336064951,2018-10-13,6867097,Luke,"A spotless, lovely home in a nice location for your Barossa getaway. Spacious outdoor area is perfect for that late afternoon glass of red. Can't really fault anything about this lovely old home which is fitted with enough modern conveniences to make your stay completely comfortable. Wouldn't hesitate to book again."
17721773,338951213,2018-10-21,219010868,Tracy,Great stay very clean good location would return if back in area
17721773,359473172,2018-12-17,56786996,Brianne,"Our stay was amazing. Photos don’t do this place justice, it’s much nicer in real life!! There is a large outdoor area with a tv and pool! The two bedrooms are large and have good sized beds! They provided towels and linen! We had a lovely stay!!"
17721773,410914509,2019-02-11,7948978,Olivia,"We absolutely loved our stay at Somerton House. The cottage is impeccably clean, beautiful on the inside and out and the location fabulous. It had all the amenities you could possibly need, and felt very homely. The outdoor area and pool was fantastic! The hosts were great with communication and very responsive. Would highly recommend!"
17721773,413690100,2019-02-17,12243763,Holly,"Absolutely stunning property in Angaston. Both bedrooms are large and comfortable and the outside space is stunning. Beautiful pool and outdoor entertaining area, highly recommended to a small family/two couples. Will definitely be back!"
17721773,415921390,2019-02-23,39082966,Blair,"This property was immaculate in every way, and the welcome basket on arrival was a nice little touch to make you feel right at home. I would highly recommend a stay here"
17721773,418701233,2019-03-02,191272300,Simon,"Similar to other reviews, we felt the photos didn't do this place justice. There is everything you need - it's a home away from home, and the outdoor living area is wonderful. The arrival pack was well received, particularly the coffee - thanks! And check-in is a breeze. The pool is warm, and everything about the stay offers a private getaway. The house is in a quiet street, yet close enough to the main street where takeaways and a grocery store provide the essentials. We loved our stay and enjoyed exploring the Barossa. We'll be back."
17862552,159891629,2017-06-12,109908081,Mark,"Awesome!!!

Thanks you so much. We had the best weekend. We travelled as 8 adults sisters and cousins with their partners.Would recommend this house for either families or a group of couples wanting a Barossa experience , the home had everything you need. Great sound system, tv's all u want!!
Thank you Jason, for giving us the best of weekends!
Cheers
Mark "
17862552,187304924,2017-08-26,25170465,Kanako,"The house is beautiful, very clean. The only challenge we had was we ran out of hot water on the second night. No Wi-Fi, only at an extra cost which we weren't aware of, no Telstra Air connection on the tv and the dvd was a little bit temperamental.  The hotwater system we found out later, has a timer so would recommend not taking a shower early evening. Just first thing or late at night as the hotwater system doesn't fill up again. 
Jason and his wife seemed nice enough. 
However couldn't recommend this place for the price."
17862552,189798498,2017-09-03,130188520,Adam,"We stayed here over the Barossa Gourmet weekend and it was everything we expected and more. Lovely, clean rooms and great spaces to sit and chat with a large group. Will most certainly stay here again if we head back to the Barossa."
17862552,205331414,2017-10-22,15331749,Diana,Jason's home is lovely! It is well appointed and very well stocked so we had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay. The home is well located within Tanunda with everything in close proximity so ideal as a base for exploring the wonderful Barossa Valley. Jason was very prompt with communication which made booking effortless. It was a great Airbnb experience and definitely somewhere I'd recommend others enjoy when in the Barossa.
17862552,214440592,2017-11-26,21955171,Michelle,"Thank you so much to Jason for allowing us the opportunity to stay at LiebenGott.  Everything was thought of......even down to having lovely chilled water in the fridge waiting for us after a long walk! Every amenity was catered for and the communication was fantastic. Would certainly recommend it a will certainly be back again.
Thanks

17862552,336073595,2018-10-14,22834061,Emma,Great house for big groups in an excellent location to explore the Barossa. We had a group of 8 and had plenty of room in the living areas. Quite a big kitchen (although we didn't use it!). Jason was a fast communicator and we were able to check in early which was great so we could make the most of our time in the Barossa.

17862552,345365952,2018-11-04,201171976,David,"The accommodation is centrally located to the nearby wineries and just a short drive to the centre of Tanunda.  The house itself is very well maintained, clean and there is plenty of space.  Jason was a very responsive and thoughtful host - we had a minor problem with the A/C which was quickly fixed after speaking with Jason.  I would definitely come back to this location and would happily recommend this accommodation.  My family equally enjoyed the space."

Everything was clean and tidy.
We really enjoyed our stay and the pool table got plenty of use in the evenings after a long day of wine tastings.
The photos make the place look a bit dark, but this was not the case in real life."

17963507,142602383,2017-04-08,123976563,Keira,"Had an absolutely amazing stay at Lesley Ann's cottage. It's centrally located, spotleslly clean and Lesley Ann was an incredible host. She made us feel like we were at home and made our expierence extra special. We will definitely be coming back! I feel like 5 stars doesn't do this place justice."
17963507,143488382,2017-04-12,82385895,Cameron,"Lesley Ann's place was a welcome oasis after a long day touring the Barossa. She was a most hospitable and welcoming host, willing to guide us on our food and wine journey through the Barossa. Everything we needed was provided for and our stay was most enjoyable. "
17963507,144917703,2017-04-16,104879472,Emma,"Warm and knowledgeable hostess, fantastic location and a very luxurious and private studio, with all you could want for an indulgent stay in the Barossa - Thankyou Lesley Ann!"
17963507,146195104,2017-04-22,1487493,Luca,"Lesley Ann è persona molto di classe, disponibilissima e simpaticissima. La casa che mette a disposizione degli ospiti è meravigliosa, e solo la mancanza del bidet è un disagio che mi impedisce di dare il massimo punteggio. Il wifi funziona benone e non c'era traccia di insetti. La colazione fornita era gustosa e completa. Il giardino circostante è bello tranquillo e silenzioso e la zona è strategica per la Barossa Valley."
17963507,146883539,2017-04-24,17063249,Claire,"Lesley Ann is a fantastic host, her studio is beautiful and well appointed, very close to the centre of town. We thoroughly enjoyed our time here and will definitely be back!"
17963507,148112408,2017-04-30,19157770,Ian,"The writers cottage at Tununda offers the perfect getaway for soulful self time, a romantic escape or just to enjoy the many and varied offerings of the colourful Barossa region. Perfectly located right in the heart of Tununda, character and charm ooze from from this little slice of heaven in the Adelaide Hills. Adorned with original artworks and quirky charm, the warmth of this little love nest is matched only only by the hospitality of its host Lesley-Anne and the beauty of its surroundings. Highly recommended, we’ll be back, both for Lesley Anne, the writers cottage itself and the fabulous varietals on offer in this unsurpassed wine making region "
17963507,152099642,2017-05-15,23269740,Sarah,"You will not be disappointed. This studio is perfect for a couple - plenty of space and privacy and lots of little comforts. It's also clean and cosy. The photos do not do it justice. We were absolutely thrilled when we arrived. The location is also perfect, being centrally positioned to explore wineries and you can easily walk to Fermentasian or Zwines, etc. for dinner. Lesley Ann was a lovely host, and she has obviously put a lot of TLC into the accommodation. "
17963507,153354077,2017-05-21,59674031,Chris,"The studio is outstanding. Located 5mins walk from the Main Street but you feel like you're in your own little world. Lesley Ann was the perfect host with lots of good advice for places to visit. 
"
17963507,156957882,2017-06-02,73725293,Nancy,"Leslie Ann's place is the best place we've stayed on our journey (and that's saying something for a 7 month trip).  Her place is well situated (all of the services you'll need are very close - and yet, the area is very quiet), plenty of room, the cottage is wonderfully decorated - and - very close to all Barossa wineries.  You will need a car for any serious exploration of the vast number of outstanding wineries. This place is extremely well located to get to all cellar doors.  Leslie Ann is a perfect host; extremely interesting to talk with (knows gobs about Barossa and about wine) and just an all around great person.  If you are going to Barossa - you've got to book Leslie Ann's place.  Trust me folks, you won't be disappointed."
17963507,157424320,2017-06-04,130238980,Annie,"Close to shops and restaurants, but felt like our own little hideaway.  Lesley Ann shared local knowledge of the area and great places to eat and visit.  Awesome host.  Thank you for sharing your home with us."
17963507,158688850,2017-06-08,8679013,Bobby Anne,"The photos are accurate but can't capture the wonderfully calm and positive ambience of the space.   The moment I walked in I knew that this was a special place.  Loads of space, lots of light from the large windows on three sides with completely private views onto the garden. Clean, cosy and comfortable.   A quiet, tranquil space and yet less to than 10 minutes walk to Murray Street  and the shops and restaurants.  (However, car necessary to go further afield.) Lesley Ann is the perfect, thoughtful host.  I definitely plan to stay here again.  Highly recommended for either a business trip or a holiday escape.  "
17963507,159899368,2017-06-12,5407410,Melissa,"We loved our stay in the writers studio. It was very clean, quiet, bright and very comfortable!

The bed was incredibly comfortable, I slept like a baby! Great cooking facilities, lots of books to read in the comfy mezzanine nook area and a beautiful garden. A lovely area that's very close to the shops, cafes and wineries. I hired a bike and cycled round the Barossa and this was the perfect base. Thank you Lesley Ann for being so lovely and welcoming, I'll be telling all my friends and family :)"
17963507,164343354,2017-06-27,60828455,Lawrence,Lovely place and an absolutely amazing host! Lesley Ann was extremely friendly and accommodating during our stay. She supplied us with inside information about the region and things to do. The accomodation was even better than described as Lesley Ann had left some local food for us to make breakfast with. Location was also on point. 
17963507,165753437,2017-07-02,21027178,Ana,Had a lovely weekend: Leslie Ann was a generous & welcoming host and the home was warm & comfortable.  Would definitely come again another day!  Thank you so much!
17963507,167771613,2017-07-08,10180747,James,"What a great little getaway in the Barossa. A cozy studio, close to town, but nicely tucked away it’ll be like your own little retreat. If it’s raining, you definitely won’t feel guilty about staying in and keeping cosy in the studio for an afternoon. 
Lesley Ann is full of great recommendations and knows everything about the region. We really appreciated Lesley Ann’s  kind spirit and knowledgeable. 
We wouldn’t think twice about staying in the Writer’s Studio next time we visited the Barossa. Thanks Lesley Ann!


"
17963507,168693135,2017-07-10,133154642,Jessica,"We had a truly wonderful weekend at the Writer's Shed. Lesley provided a very warm welcome, and had decked out the fridge with all the necessities for a cup of a tea and a cooked breakfast. This was particularly appreciated after we left our bag of food back home in Adelaide! The place was so much more beautiful in real life than the photos could capture, we didn't want to leave. Lesley is a fantastic host, and was very willing to provide us with tips to maximise our weekend stay. Will spread the word and hopefully be back!"
17963507,169248026,2017-07-12,23252327,Jennifer,"Perfect place, in a great location. Very responsive and generous host. The place was cosy and filled with great jigsaw puzzles and books to keep us occupied. Would stay again!  "

Perfect secluded location close to restaurants, shops and wineries. Lesley Anne is the perfect host. And we wanted for nothing. . Pamela Adelaide. July 2017. "
17963507,170532543,2017-07-15,9566451,Simone,"The Barossa Valley is fantastic: great wines, tasty food and beautiful landscape. The writer's studio is a beautifully/tastefully decorated self-contained shed, with good facilities, very quiet, and centrally located, providing access (by car) to all villages nearby. Lesley Ann was a great host, offering her local knowledge of the region, but also providing us with privacy. The only problem we found was the inflatable bed, which was not very comfortable."
17963507,171562578,2017-07-18,32202732,Anna,"The Writer's Studio was a really fantastic place to get away for a few days. It was walkable to some wineries and restaurants and the studio itself was well decorated clean, and well stocked with kitchen gear and entertainment for rainy days (which we definitely used). We would absolutely stay again. "
17963507,172428317,2017-07-21,52727609,Emily,"We stayed at the Writer's studio as the last stop on a two week holiday - it was the highlight of our trip! Lesley Ann welcomed us warmly with a hand written note, fresh bread and milk, and supplies for bacon and eggs for breakfast.

The studio is comfortable, warm and clean and is decorated with so many interesting pieces of art. The blow up bed has a base and a pump to top it up and we found that it was as comfortable as a normal bed. Lesley Ann was also extremely attentive and immediately followed up an unavoidable maintenance issue. 

We really loved the selection of puzzles, books and games, the little mezzanine floor was the perfect spot to relax in the afternoon with a cup of tea and a book.

Our advice is for everyone to ask Lesley Ann where they should visit in the Barossa. Her recommendations made our holiday, we wish we could give an extra star. We would come back here in a heart beat - next time for a longer stay! "
17963507,173792641,2017-07-24,131966807,Loan,Beautiful and very cosy. Close to the shops and walkable distance to the main cafes and street of Tanunda. It is tucked away so no traffic noise. Such a beautiful stay with a gracious host. Extremely clean and we appreciated the breakfast ingredients and fresh bread! Lesley Ann is an amazing hostess and the Writer's Studio is a must for a couple looking for a quick getaway from city life! 
17963507,174747233,2017-07-27,132006164,Tyler,"Thank you so much Lesley Ann!! This was such a beautiful location, house and all round experience. The studio was so warm, homely and inviting. There were beautiful flowers outside and views from the attic. There is no doubt I'll be back to get some quiet study done or be in close vicinity to Barossas best wineries again. Thanks :)"
17963507,175426435,2017-07-29,129978482,Lisa,"This place is an absolute gem! It was my first time in the Barossa and the location couldn't have been better, nor could I have asked for anything more from Lesley Ann as a host and the studio - was so well stocked, and a little bit magical! Lesley Ann made it feel as though we were staying at the back of an old friend's place, with lots of local tips and hot spots of where to go for great food and wine. She was so lovely, I'll definitely be back!"
17963507,178593351,2017-08-06,131992500,Shana,"Very true to pictures, nice location to the main Street. Lesley leaves bacon and eggs and bread which is very generous of her.

It is within walking distance to some of the best restaurants in the area, but if you fancy an evening in, the apartment is so cosy; we especially loved the reading nook. Lesley Ann is the perfect host, giving great personalised recommendations for vineyards and restaurants that really added to our experience. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend a stay here, and would love to return - next time for longer!"

17963507,202126562,2017-10-10,141217699,Emily,Fantastic location and such a cozy and relaxing space. Leslie Ann was a lovely host and she had lots of great suggestions about places to eat/drink but at the same time she gave us lots of privacy during our stay. It didn’t feel like we were on someone else’s property. The tv had chrome cast which was awesome and Leslie Ann provided us with bacon and eggs for us to cook breakfast which was a lovely touch. We would definitely stay here again!

The studio space itself is quirky, comfortable and beautiful and had everything my partner and I needed. It is a short walk to the main street in Tanunda including the Foodland if you need to stock up. There is also an amazing Cellar Door on the corner of Lesley Ann's street and the main rd, Z Wines. 
Although the studio is at the back of Lesley Ann's place it is private and quiet. Lesley Ann was a fabulous host and was able to recommend a number of great spots for wine tasting and eating and we will most certainly be back to check out those we couldn't make it to all in the weekend. Cannot thank Lesley Ann enough!"

It’s a really large space, feels private and tucked away at the back of the house. It’s a cute converted shed with amazing decor and a nice outlook on the garden. The kitchen is completely stocked with everything you could need. We were treated to fresh bread/eggs and bacon on arrival which was such a nice touch. The bed was so comfortable, doesn’t feel like a blow up at all. Had the best sleeps in it! Did not want to leave. The location is perfect for exploring Barossa, right out the front of a winery.

We spent two days there during winter....the weather was pretty wet on one day and we had no hestiation staying indoors, cooking lunch and sharing a bottle or two of local wine.  Take your time to look at all the books that surround one of the walls. The location is just down the road from the local Foodland, near the Workers Club...(great for a meal) and also down the road from Z a winebar...what more do you need?"

17963507,403885419,2019-01-21,2976804,Sally,"We had a great 4 nights in the Tanunda for my birthday. The Studio is artsy, spacious, clean and well supplied. It was in a great location. It was quiet and private also close to town and right in the Barossa. (We booked a tour for one of the days so we could both have drinks and they picked us up and dropped us off at the front which was great). Lesley Ann was a great host, she provided us with delicious breakfast supplies. We had fresh (locally made) bread, bacon, eggs and coffee everyday which meant we could set off exploring easily without searching for breakfast first in town (fantastic!) Lesley Ann had some great recommendations, we went to a number of wineries and restaurants she suggested and loved them all! We highly recommend staying here. Thank you again for a great stay Lesley Ann."
17963507,404653302,2019-01-25,3853373,Mikaela,"An absolutely lovely stay. Lesley Ann is such a wonderful host & the studio is just gorgeous- even better than the listing pictures. I didn’t want for a thing during my stay. 

The location is perfect, a stones throw from everything in town. Only wish my stay was longer - will definitely return !"
17963507,405907072,2019-01-27,23491765,Caroline,"Lesley Ann is an amazing host with a breath of local knowledge and great recommendations. The place is unique and peaceful, beautifully decorated and located right in the middle of the action, a few hundred meters away from the centre of Tanunda. We only stayed for a weekend but I wish we could have stayed longer, we had a wonderful time."
17963507,407066513,2019-02-01,228690610,Marie,Wonderfully unique ... fabulous location ... very comfortable ... Lesley Ann rocks!
17963507,407656969,2019-02-02,1270502,Rayna,"Staying here was lovely - a charming room, full of personality, felt very private and had a lovely outlook onto the garden areas. The location was fantastic for hitting the wine bars and local eating in Tanunda, plus access to surrounding wineries and Barossa offerings. Lesley shared fantastic tips for eating, drinking and local experiences. We followed as many tips as we found the time for and they were spot on, plus we have some amazing ideas for our next trip. Thank you Lesley!"

17963507,412160721,2019-02-15,1011474,Spike,"Fabtastic stay. The place is like the pics. Alle elements in there: calm, rest, books, even set of dvd and chromecast, kitchen well equipped though only one heatpit, bathroom immaculate and a treat.
Location is also great: from here you just walk within 10 mins to the best winebar and restaurant in town, how great is that.
Lesley Ann is a perfect host. I work in wine and she provided me with the exact right directions. She more than knows her way around the wineries so her advice is gold. And she gives you all the space you need but is always available to help out. And she is just a very kind, good and smart & savvy person.
This place was just what I needed, travelling alone and with my roadbike, as a base for cycletraining through the Barossa and visiting the best wineries in the area, all in a short timeperiod."
17963507,412943619,2019-02-16,37647419,Trudi,"Delightful accommodation, central location but very quiet and private, fully self-contained. Lovely personal touches throughout makes for the perfect getaway in the Barossa."

17963507,420849427,2019-03-08,227565044,Vanessa,"Such a great space to relax in while planning our time in the Barossa. The extra touch of bacon, eggs and fresh bread waiting for us on arrival was a delightful addition and Lesley Ann's recommendations of where to eat and explore made our time there all the more perfect."
17963507,421582014,2019-03-09,85242696,Sam,"Accomodation, host and location were all great. Could not fault it, looking forward to coming back."

17980547,146468764,2017-04-23,126550255,Joseph,"The property is amazing and makes for a great getaway; its peaceful and plenty of space to go for a wonder around. Peter and Marijan were the best hosts we could ask for; they made sure we had everything we needed, were easy to get hold of, and offered us a late check out. Marijan even left us amazing pikelets and comquat marmalade!!! She's a gem!! The cottage is quaint and cosy. A woodfire in the living room hearkens to the cooler months ensconsed in the inviting warmth of the fire with a fabulous red and a book. The gardens are remarkable; we had the chance to observe the changeling colours of autumn in the trees. We imagine spring would be amazing too. There is a vineyard to meander through, and lamas and sheep share this wonderful retreat with you. We cannot wait to return and spend a few days retreating in these beautiful surrounds. "
17980547,152517190,2017-05-17,126715938,Tony,"We stayed here for work, it had a great location and large spaces for parking even enough room for the truck. more then that it offered the space need in the house for our crew. the gardens and surrounding land offer piece and quite after a hard days work. The host went the extra mile to make us welcome and feel like we were at home. The history was lost on the boys but it wasn't hard to see."
17980547,153142301,2017-05-20,128341494,Cat,"Marijan and Peter were very welcoming and very knowledgeable of the land they have taken on and let us explore their property, with a private tour while we stayed for a lovely two nights on their glorious estate. 
Will highly recommend and definitely return in the future to see their hard work and progress on the estate to relax in the peace and quiet of the mountains. "
17980547,153403759,2017-05-21,20734867,Selina,"The house is really nice and comfortable, there is everything you need. We had a very good time walking around in the hills, petting the alpacas on the property and everybody was really nice and caring and Marijan was happy explaining things and giving us tips about where to go in the Barossa, walking trails etc."
17980547,168115449,2017-07-09,26181840,Jacquie,"Marijan and Peter's cottage is a special place. You can pick your poison there: relax by the open fire, breathe deep as you wander the beautiful property, or jump in your car for a delicious visit to a local cellar door. The accommodation is just as it is described - very functional and comfortable. The open fire kept the cottage perfectly warm and added wonderful atmosphere. Marijan was a fantastic host. She had the cottage prepped for every eventuality, made us pikelets, and stayed up late to greet us as we arrived in the pouring rain. Make sure you take her up on her offer to have a tour around the property - it is wonderful. We will definitely be coming back to Martinsell. We loved it. "
17980547,169550283,2017-07-13,2777604,Michael,Awesome hosts - went out of their ways to accommodate us. Will definitely recommend and stay here again.
17980547,170589684,2017-07-16,136840888,Tim,"Lovely county property. Right at Mt Crawford for walking, bike/horse riding. Great view out across the paddock. Well equipped for family weekend away. Great hosts. "
17980547,172792273,2017-07-22,9670622,Antony,"Marijan greeted us at the gate and had the fire roaring for us on arrival. It's a quiet old property with sheep and alpacas roaming freely. The cottage is decorated in a simple style and is impeccably clean and comfortable. We brought our own cheese platter and a meal to pop in the oven so we were playing cards in front of the fire in no time. We opted to spend the next day on a short hike up Mt Crawford and then a drive through Angaston, Tanunda and Birdwood. Marijan's place was the ideal accommodation to feel like we'd really gotten away from it all and we'd love to return some day to see more of the area."
17980547,177811056,2017-08-04,25445354,Lisa,Gorgeous property in the barossa with plenty of wildlife!  The sheep and alpacas were lovely to watch and the indoor fire was cozy.   I would definitely recommend this roomy cottage!
17980547,178585826,2017-08-06,26973596,Malcolm & Lynn,"Peter and Marijan's property is in easy reach of Barossa Valley wineries and sites, numerous walking trails like the Heysen Trail and mountain bike routes. It is also perfect for relaxing. It is an interesting and historic property important for the history of the Barossa. Our accommodation was above the original barn, simple, functional, exceptionally clean and a little old fashioned. We loved Marijan's pikelets, the tour of the main house and the efficient combustion heater in the cold winter's weather. Thank you Marijan and Peter for minding our bags and the enjoyable stay."
17980547,184490394,2017-08-20,112872020,Varuni,"Peter and Marijan's place was lovely. It was on a road less traveled but the property was charming and old worldly. Because it has a history - the property is getting restored bit by bit and it's wonderful to step back in time and take in the atmosphere. We wanted a break and a breather from the city and the place was exceptional. Billy and Sterling (the Alpacas) were adorable and we loved the tour of the property. Our son got to experience what it is like to be a farmer. Overall it was a wonderful stay and because it's a short drive to Williamstown, Tanunda and Angoston, we enjoyed the local eateries and delicacies as well. Wonderful place to stay while on holiday."
17980547,186205246,2017-08-24,1741798,Kari,Oh my goodness if you want to experience a beautiful rustic retreat then this is the place to go. We were greeted with a warm cottage and some friendly alpacas. Our beds were so warm and cosy had the best sleep and that fresh country air just added to it all. Do your self a favour if you're going to the Barossa stay here.
17980547,187933918,2017-08-28,57346159,Adam,"Thank you for the very peaceful  and warm stay at your beautiful place. the whole place was perfect and the hosts are super friendly, i couldn't have hoped for anything more"
17980547,192171641,2017-09-10,60859337,Glenn,"Quiet, secluded, fresh air, very special farmhouse type ambience. 
Marijan is a very welcoming host. 
The home itself is simple yet comfortable, like walking back 40 years in time and some of the furnishings and implements match that era. 
Lovely to wake up and see ""Dorper"" sheep grazing outside your window. The legendary Roos did not make an appearance but we didn't miss it!
The surroundings are lovely for walking and exploring
and offer ruins, pine forests, streams and vistas of rolling hills. 
For a family used to life in inner Adelaide, this was quite magical."
17980547,195008377,2017-09-18,10687993,Tina,Lovely farm style stay in beautiful rural surroundings. Thank you for hosting

17980547,210347964,2017-11-09,100968803,Amy,"Don't miss the opportunity to stay at Martinsell and Pewsey Vale! Marijan and Peter have created the most beautiful place here -- the cottage is in such a glorious setting, and the sheep, alpacas and old gums make it really special.  Marijan has thought of everything, and their tips for outings and places to eat were spot on. Our son will never forget helping hand-feed the baby lamb and the alpaca gents. Thank you so much for a gorgeous couple of days -- we hope to be back!"
17980547,210941652,2017-11-11,138044246,Noel,"We would highly recommend this as a stay for groups both big and small. The property is incredibly picturesque and is ideal for relaxing outside or taking walks. 

The cottage was spacious and comfortable with everything we needed. The host Marijan was very hospitable in offering us a tour of the property; the stories behind the manor  and the gardens added a tremendous amount of enjoyment for us as a group.

The area is easily accessible with a car and the local wineries and town markets are a short drive away. Without a doubt we would love to go back."
17980547,212230360,2017-11-16,143062870,John,"We had a great time at Martinsell Cottage and would return there anytime. We loved the pleasant and unique rural location. Marijan met us at the gate (it was drizzling) and welcomed us in. We learned the history of the property, which we partly knew, enjoyed the convivial atmosphere and the guided tour of their property.  Mt Crawford and Martinsell is a great place to visit."
17980547,216449961,2017-12-03,75122823,Craig,"Wonderful greeting with freshly cut roses and plenty of helpful advice regarding the Barossa from Marijan.

17980547,225560081,2018-01-07,17665342,Brent,"Peter and Marijan made us feel so very at home in their beautiful cottage. Marijan even gave us a private tour of their stunning sprawling property! There are sheep and alpaca running around, all very friendly, and the cottage has everything you need. A quiet and cozy place, 20 minutes drive from the centre of the Barossa. I recommend staying here as the drive to town is beautiful, with a limit over the region as you drive in to town. I can't wait for them to finish the work on their château, as it is already looking amazing and luxurious, and a great alternative to the cottage."
17980547,226463417,2018-01-10,71060757,Paulo,"Very friendly, comfortable house, spotless clean and Marijan and Peter will be the best hosts of your trip!!"

17980547,291499752,2018-07-16,30513683,Lina,"I highly recommend Marijan and Pete's Martinsell Cottage. The place was big, clean and  had everything we you could possible need.
Marijan gave us great recommendations on places to eat, to visit, best scenic roads, and was very helpful every step of the way.
My favorite part of the holidays spent in the Barossa was the tour around this property, we fed the sheep and the alpacas, had a walk around the vineyard and heard the amazing history behind this beautiful property.  There is no money that could pay to make up and go for a walk around Martinsell Place, I completely love the property and would love to go back."
17980547,298044842,2018-07-29,22671174,Kalyna,An amazing weekend away in the most perfect place. I feel so rejuvenated and will definitely be returning.

17980547,329453332,2018-09-29,76734026,Crystal,"The Martinsell Cottage sits alongside Martinsell Manor. Both are listed on Airbnb although the cottage is where we stayed, due to our more modest budget! We found it to be of great value and the hosts were wonderful - Marijan even took us on a tour of the grounds and manor, which was very interesting. Marijan and her husband Peter are meticulously recovering and renovating the manor and other parts of the property.
The cottage is clean and pleasant. The kitchen is fully functional and comes with tea, coffee and basic breakfast supplies. The bathroom is clean and large, and the water is hot with reasonable water pressure. So lovely to have a fireplace in the lounge room also! While there are no facilities for babies, Marijan was more than happy for us to bring our 3 month old, and we just brought our own portacot.
The Martinsell Cottage is a convenient and comfortable base for exploring Barossa wineries by car, and we would definitely stay there again!"
17980547,335681581,2018-10-12,208125068,Carol,"Amazing place.  Quiet, slightly out of the way but close to every thing you need in the Barossa.  Lie in bed in the morning and only here the animals, birds and bees.  Huge place from two people to six, would be great place for large family with kids also.  Tour of the property is a total added bonus.  What has been achieved in two years is mind boggling.  Conserving all that history!  I will be back."
17980547,337610837,2018-10-17,1249619,Shirley,We had a lovely stay at the cottage. Great communication and hosting from Marijan and Peter. Would love to be back.

17980547,354476217,2018-12-01,34181114,Kiaran,"We stayed for two nights in Marijan and Peter's cottage on their very scenic property.  The cottage itself was extremely comfortable, clean, and well equipped.  Marijan was a perfect host, meeting us on arrival (and very flexible when we changed our arrival time late in the day) and giving us a very interesting tour of the property, including the manor house, fitting in with our schedule to do so.  We had some marvellous meals in the cottage, prepared in the well-equipped kitchen.  When a (rare and brief) power cut, caused by an intense electrical storm, threatened one of our dinners Marijan came over straight away and helped us with setting up a BBQ.  It was an excellent and restful stay in a beautiful part of the country."

17980547,368746803,2019-01-07,108297669,Carolyn,"This was the place we just couldn't get enough of, even after 5 days there. Peter and Marian are such good folks, very accommodating hosts, and full of helpful tips for what to do and see.  You basically will have your own country estate, complete with a spacious house, a small flock of sheep amongst the enormous red gum trees, the occasional kangaroo, and two friendly alpacas. The furnishings in the house are simple but quite adequate. The house itself and the other buildings on the property are lovingly restored from their early days, and are wonderful. It's out of town and up in the hills, but still an easy drive to shops, wineries, etc. The more rural setting added a lot to its appeal for us. We loved it!"
17980547,411551885,2019-02-12,1625715,Katherine,"The cottage is an amazing space that is just perfect as a base to explore the Barossa valley. The cottage has everything you need, and is consistently styled in the 1970’s theme. The kitchen is fully equipped, and there are plenty of blankets for cold nights. It was just the two of us staying, but the space can comfortably fit three generations with the three great bedrooms and multiple bathrooms. The views on the property are stunning. We were able to walk around the property, even to their vineyard which was so great. There’s lots of amazing animals on the property too, and you can spy sheep, alpaca, and kangaroos from the cottage. The location is totally private, and yet conveniently located to cellar door locations for making the most of the region. We also got a tour of the manor, which is suited for a very luxurious stay. I would highly recommend it, and would come back here again"
17980547,424508420,2019-03-17,113297799,Barry,"If you want to escape to a peaceful oasis at the end of busy winery and township touring, this is just the place to stay. This comfortable, spacious cottage, nestled among ancient gums and towering pines is a perfect, economical  refuge with wildlife, vineyards and livestock within metres of the door! A place of very interesting Australian history and a chance to witness great work-in-progress on the nearby stone buildings by the hosts. Don't miss this!"
17980547,425751767,2019-03-19,23578858,Julie,Martinsell Cottage is in a lovely setting which is peaceful and quiet. Marijan and Peter are friendly and helpful and the cottage has everything you need. It was a perfect base for our Heysen Trail walks not too far from Williamstown or Tanunda. It was lovely to look over Martinsell Manor and see all the work they have done there. We thoroughly enjoyed our two night stay.
18276899,159870529,2017-06-11,128665437,Krystal,"What a beautiful little cottage, close to town and local wineries, though their own wines were the best we had! Owners were very thoughtful and accommodating. Highly recommend to stay! "
18276899,161930403,2017-06-19,134909231,Tony,"From the get go Cynthia was a fantastic communicator. Fire place was lit prior to our arrival and a lovely breakfast hamper and some chocolates to settle us in. The location is absolutely spot on. Smack bang in the middle of some of the best wineries in Australia. 
We will definitely be back. 
Thanks again Rolf and Cynthia. "
18276899,166249614,2017-07-03,46810152,Daniel,"Where to start? The place was beautiful, cosy and had everything we need for a perfect long weekend. The fireplace was roaring by the time we got in, and the beds were super comfortable and warm. The kitchen was well stoked with some local produce and we loved our complimentary bottle of red.

The house itself is within walking distance of at least three fantastic wineries (Peter Lehman, Langmeil & Dave Franz) with Cynthia and Rolf's winery (Rolf Binder) only being a short drive up the road (be sure to also check them out!).

Rolf and Cynthia went above and beyond to show us a great time in the Borossa, with winery and dinner recommendations only ever being a text away.

Thanks again for an amazing long weekend, we are already planning our return."
18276899,189798955,2017-09-03,86856652,Jo,"A lovely weekend in the Barossa! Cynthia was so helpful and welcoming, providing lots of information & recommendations for the surrounding area.

18276899,197783065,2017-09-27,151222301,Barry,"An exemplary place to stay whilst in the Barossa, everything needed is in the house. Loved time on the verandah and in front of the fire. Cynthia kept in touch with us once booked and ensured a perfect stay from start to finish. Thoroughly enjoyed a wine tasting with her at the cellar door and we look forward to a return visit to Hanisch House and Rolf Binder wines. Thank you Cynthia and Rolf."
18276899,205848522,2017-10-23,39544636,Jo,"Rolf Binder accomodation was amazing. We stayed at Hanisch Haus & it was basically perfect. Very cute cottage with everything we needed, very close to wineries & quite close to town. The cottage was very clean, the breakfast provided were more than enough & thoughtful. Thoroughly recommend !!"
18276899,213746956,2017-11-22,120317174,Richa And Ritin,"The Cottage is beautiful and very cozy. Its centrally located at the same time secluded as its towards the end of road. The wine by the host was excellent , the food was well stocked and the kitchen has all amenities. The communication was great. You actually go back in time when you live there , would recommend for someone looking for that experience."
18276899,253556155,2018-04-15,52305035,Caro,Lovely house in the Barossa valley on the estate of wine makers (Rolf Binder) whose complimentary bottle and great breakfast material awaited us. A wonderful place with lots of charm and a working fire place. Well existed and likely cozy and warm in cold weather.
18276899,280757859,2018-06-24,124641721,Tara,Our stay at Rolf and Cynthia's house was superb!  We were welcomed by the fire already going and a great bottle of Rolf Binder wine which was enjoyed over our stay.  The breakfast supplies were plentiful and more than enough for our two night stay.   The house was beautiful and the bed was very comfortable.  The location was excellent and walking distance to some great wineries (including Rolf Binder of course)!   We had a great time and would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a great place to stay in the Barossa.  Thanks Rolf and Cynthia!

The four of us enjoyed the delicious breakfast provisions each morning and appreciated the nice little touches to the home. Thanks for a great weekend!"
18276899,422391701,2019-03-11,68139100,Bonnie,"What a wonderful home, oozing country charm, right in the heart of the Barossa Valley. Cynthia was AMAZING to deal with. We only ever needed to travel a maximum of 12 minutes to visit the many wineries, produce markets, farms etc. in the area! The breakfast provisions provided were both generous and delicious. And the Rolf Binder winery is a must visit - great pizza, Shiraz, Reisling...! We will certainly be back. Thank you Cynthia and Rolf."
18743623,201162954,2017-10-07,41305437,Simon,"Fantastic retreat next to a gorgeous lake, completely private sleeping up to 6.  Beautiful surrounds in great location to explore the Barossa.

18743623,202770482,2017-10-13,42870804,Belinda,"A gorgeous vintage farmhouse on the edge of a your own personal lake! Not only can the lake be toured via paddle boat, it can be enjoyed while sitting in the private outdoor spa! This is a very special property, nestled in amongst the vines of the Barossa Valley. Many memorable nights were spent in the spa with a glass of Barossa Shiraz! Annie is an exceptional host. We arrived with the fire ready to light, the spa warm, local breakfast provisions in abundance and chocolates by the bed. We certainly recommend this property to anyone who wants to relax in a beautiful setting with wine tasting at your fingertips!"
18743623,212664220,2017-11-18,43975968,Nicole,Had an amazing time!!! Location was lovely close enough to drive anywhere but remote enough to relax and unwind. Would definitely come back
18743623,218070075,2017-12-10,159545416,Michelle,"A nice relaxing place to stay. Everything you need has been supplied, plus a lovely glass of Port to sip each night from the small barrel. The views were lovely and the wildlife is awesome. The spa is perfectly placed. A good family retreat."

Annie has thought of everything with all her personal touches around this lovely cottage. Would stay here again and have passed on the details to friends. You will not regret booking this place.thank you for a special weekend, Annie."
18743623,298872937,2018-07-30,32699446,Julie,"We loved Annie's place, we spent the weekend bird watching and relaxing. We hardly saw our 10 year old as she divided her time between watching the echidna family, going on the paddleboat and exploring around the property. Having a spa in the evening was great for everyone. Thanks for having us."
18743623,313736916,2018-08-26,68327004,Eilis,annie place is just gorgeous wish we could of stayed longer. loved all of her personal touches. she really has thought of everything. thank you
18743623,336076130,2018-10-14,14348207,Liam,Jandas Lake View was exactly what we were looking for - a wonderful country getaway. Our group wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

18798879,196635552,2017-09-23,1404273,Sabine & Jason,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
18798879,249223142,2018-04-01,15615457,Cassandra,"This historic apartment is beautifully furnished and in an absolutely perfect location - a quiet street a few minutes walk from the main street of Angaston.  
The apartment was well equipped with everything we needed, including a Nespresso machine and thoughtful touches like Lindt chocolates. Mark replied to all messages quickly, check in was a breeze, and we loved the warm welcome from Mark's 3 small and friendly dogs each morning. We loved staying here and would definitely stay again next time we are in the Barossa. 
We were here for a wedding so didn't have a lot of time for exploring but would highly recommend the Barossa Farmers Market for breakfast on a Saturday."
18798879,330712327,2018-10-01,61475070,Denise,"1851 @ Hill House was such a wonderful experience.  From the minute we confirmed our booking, Mark was welcoming, attentive and so helpful.  From restaurant suggestions to offering to confirm bookings, nothing was too hard.  Check in was a breeze and we loved the attention we received from not only Mark, but his three gorgeous and friendly dogs.  1851 is a gorgeous and very cosy cottage, with so much history and character.  Mark has fitted out the cottage beautifully.  Tucked away in Angaston, we loved that it was only a short drive from the wine trail.  
When Mark discovered that Riesling is my go-to wine, he immediately offered to organise a wine-tasting with RieslingFreak (a MUST DO if you're in Tanunda) and even organised transport to the cellar door.  
Mark also recommended a meal at FermentAsian - another ""must do"".  As it was the long weekend, the degustation menu was on offer and wow - what an experience.  An extremely impressive wine list so Mark's advice to leave the car in Angaston was a good call!  
It's worth noting that Angaston is much quieter than other towns in the Barossa so a car is essential and take note of opening hours.  We were there during a long weekend and a lot of places were closed entirely or early.
A wonderful weekend... and we'll definitely be back!"

The place is a short walk from the town centre so it proved to be very convenient. Most wineries in the Barossa are a 15 minute drive away. I definitely recommend this place!!"

A great place in a central area for exploring the Barossa Valley "

18845618,207794718,2017-10-30,2149107,Chris,"Overall a comfortable, clean base to stay for exploring the Barossa Valley. Location was excellent and in a quiet area but also very close to town. Some small maintenance issues  regarding the blocked shower head and a temperamental fridge but well-maintained otherwise. Useability would be much improved by adding enough hooks/hangers and/or towel rails sufficient for the number of people that the place accommodates. We were not able to use Wi-fi although the property was supposedly connected. Suggest you check about the quality and connectivity of wi-fi if that is important to you."
18845618,208535623,2017-11-01,11229040,Tom,"Great place for exploring Barossa, lovely sunny patio outside to eat on and a quiet spot. Also in walking distance from shops/restaurants/wineries and tourist info where you can hire bikes. All the amenities necessary for a short break away :)"

18845618,227075013,2018-01-13,120322349,Lukasz,"This is one amazing place. Shannon is a great host and any questions were answered very quickly. Nice touches included leaving icy poles for the kids in anticipation of hot weather. How good is that?
The place is spacious and very clean with great amenities (coffee machine with capsules and milk frother included). Good for a hot day as well with AC and fans in bedrooms. Plenty of useful tips left in the folder. Sheltered place for a car as well. The front yard was great for kids, we played games there and they could run around. In the evening we enjoyed our wine there and stargazing. 
Location is prime. Short walk to shops and restaurants (took us less than 10 min to get to fermentAsian). And a great base to explore Barossa Valley wines, which we did extensively. Very short drives to wineries in all directions, some can be visited by foot from Shannon's place.
Highly recommended, so book with confidence if you are considering a stay in Tanunda."
18845618,227920974,2018-01-17,10165230,Paul,Shannon's place was central in Tanunda and a great place to stay for a Barossa valley trip.  Well appointed kitchen and very clean

The location was great, being a short drive to multiple wineries in the region, and walking distance to local pubs and the general store.

Thank you for letting us stay in your place. It was absolutely awesome and exactly what I was looking for. Everyone loved it, the house had so much character, it was perfect for our family reunion. Pool table, giant dining room table inside and outside, games area outside , the entire feel of the place just summed up the Barossa experience for us. Loved it. Not to mention the little welcome platter full of gooddies and the port."

The house was immaculately clean and was an adventure to explore with all of the different rooms! We loved having meals on the beautiful long table outside overlooking the garden. We had a group of 10 and were able to access wineries of our choice (ranging from 5 mins to 20 mins away) by using Barossa Taxis taxi (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) who were very reasonably priced for a large group. Overall highly recommended, we had an amazing time"
19056546,248653577,2018-04-01,110755982,Erika,"I hardly know where to start to convey what a fabulous house this is!! The photos don’t really do it justice, it’s amazing. 10 of us stayed over Easter for a wedding in the Barrosa and the space was perfect. There are so many parts to the home that we all had our own space and access to a bath room (there’s three). You honestly could not find a better house for a big group or extended family. 
We spent a lovely first afternoon having glasses of wine in the garden then a big Good Friday dinner around the huge dining table. Followed by a pool competition for some and Netflix for others using the thoughtfully provided Telstra TV and WIFI.
Breakfast every morning outside in the sun. I could not think of a better way to spend the weekend. 
Julie was a fantastic host, great communication and really flexible with check in and check out times. 
Very very highly recommended."

19056546,261146973,2018-05-06,46901909,Tracey,"What an absolutely outstanding home to spend a weekend in the Barossa Valley. Julie was wonderful and was very helpful prior to and during our stay. 

The place is beautiful and the perfect accommodation for a group getaway. The large dining table and the addition of the pool table made this stay an even better experience as we were all able to be together. 

We truly had the most amazing time and couldn’t have wished for a more perfect home to stay in. We could not recommend this enough."
19056546,266309837,2018-05-20,57361748,Julie,"The Coffee Palace was the perfect accommodation for our recent family celebrations. Right from the onset Julie was very quick to resepond to any of our queries and incredibly obliging with her time in clarifying  the sleeping arrangements etc.  Nestled in the town of Lyndoch this large home has a rich history and is beautifully maintained.  Julie provided a large platter, which we greatly appreciated upon arrival.  The large country kitchen is well equipped with modern appliances. The 3 lounge rooms are very comfortable and having the billiard table just adds to the entertainment space. There is a large television on both levels and wifi connection.  The bedroom downstairs with the ensuite is very large with plenty of storage area. The linen in each of the bedrooms were of good quality and the bedroom in the cellar became the ideal retreat for our youngest members (accessed by a metal spiral staircase). Having two modern and clean bathrooms upstairs proved ideal for the numerous  guests. The weather unfortunately did not allow us to take advantage of the fabulous outside areas and garden, we did however use the BBQ (under shelter).  Despite the coldness the upper level of this large home has ducted heating with split systems downstairs. Electric blankets are provided to the 2 bedrooms downstairs.  If staying for a lengthy time there is also a laundry.  This accommodation is best suited to guests with access to a car or an organised tour group.  There is a small supermarket and a cafe within walking distance.  The Coffee Palace is a great 'home' to base yourself and to tour the many wineries, vineyards, cafes and restaurants of the Barossa Valley With the eldest member of our group at 82 and our youngest at 19 all were in agreeance that this accommodation with its eclectic furnishings became our home within minutes of entering."
19056546,272709495,2018-06-04,31723600,Joel,"Perfect accommodation for a large group visiting the Barossa. Plenty of space, bedrooms, relaxing areas and a pool table to boot! Highly recommended"

19056546,290672104,2018-07-15,61477529,Vicki,We had the pleasure of staying at this HUGE house for two nights recently. You really can’t want for anything. Lots of bedrooms and three bathrooms with a separate toilet outside too. Large lounge and dining and enough glassware and plates for 16 adults to be kept happy. We took a two min stroll to the Main Street and had a lovely breakfast. Our host Julie was so accommodating and even organised some platters of food in time for our arrival. We paid for these but it was so kind of her to organise them and buy local produce. I would highly recommend this house for large groups as we were all very comfortable and happy with our stay. Thanks for having us!
19056546,293205718,2018-07-20,132869102,Bronwen,"Great place to stay We had 11 in our party and after a very long road trip it was just the place to unwind. Teenage kids loved all the extra space and of course the pool table.
Thanks"
19056546,299893749,2018-08-01,148749304,Dallas,"The Coffee Palace is an amazing home to stay.  The beds were all extremely comfortable and every room was well appointed.  We were a group of 8 and we all struggled to use all the space provided.  The location is perfect with local restaurants, foodland and pub within walking distance. Because the home was so welcoming, we chose to stay in and enjoy it instead of going out.  Absolutely would recommend this to anyone wanting a great travelling experience. "
19056546,301880409,2018-08-05,62579471,Constance,"Wonderful experience staying in a beautiful, historic building. Spotlessly clean and well provisioned and room to spare"

19056546,327475833,2018-09-23,5194622,Stephen,"Three families stayed at the Coffee Palace for 2 nights on our way from Melbourne to the Flinders Ranges. We had such a good time that there were a few suggestions to scrap the Flinders Ranges and stay at the Coffee Palace for the week! The property is fantastic, such a unique building. The hospitality and communication from Julie was first class. I'd recommend the Coffee Palace to anyone looking for a place to stay in the Barossa Valley."
19056546,330745431,2018-10-01,161749176,Danniella,We had such an amazing stay!! Such a perfect location and amazing house with such beautiful setting!!
19056546,333145047,2018-10-07,37470780,David,The property is a great way to share a holiday with a large group of people  under the one roof.  All bedrooms were spacious and between 8 people there was plenty of room.  There is an upstairs and downstairs living space making it feel very roomy.  The kitchen and outdoor BBQ area also felt very large so that you can enjoy cooking up some local produce and shares some wines whilst doing it.
19056546,339729819,2018-10-22,9277025,Graeme,Great group space with an old-time/rustic feel !

...if you're quick, grab the master bedroom like we did :D

Thanks Julie, we'll see you again soon!"
19056546,403452621,2019-01-20,3297320,Dave,Julie’s place suits a large group perfectly. There are lots of rooms and great spaces to do your own thing so you can all have your own space. The outdoor area feels like a slice of Tuscany. We will be back.
19056546,415960958,2019-02-24,84207308,Maree,"Although we didn’t meet Julie, she was a great and responsive host. The welcome platter was appreciated. 12 close friends met for our annual get together. We had 4 nights at the Coffee House.
There was plenty of room around the big dining table for our evening meal each day.
Breakfast and afternoon drinks and cheese platters were consumed at the huge table on the back verandah..
The perfect location to visit the abundance of wineries in the area.
A great time was had by all."

19056546,428355746,2019-03-25,28907898,Margaret,"A fabulous place for a large group. We were a group of 10 school friends on our annual weekend get together and we had plenty space to relax. The rooms were well appointed, comfortable and everything was spotless. 
The location was great for access to the Barossa and in walking distance of the main street and a cafe with great coffee.
Julie was a wonderful host, very responsive which made planning our weekend away easy and enjoyable."
19056546,438131107,2019-04-16,161239108,Liz,"From the moment we contacted Julie her friendliness and communication was great. When we arrived at the home we fell in love, and instantly knew we were going to enjoy our stay! We spent just 2 nights but wished we had time to stay even longer, and hope to maybe again one day! Lyndoch is such a great spot and the home is positioned right in the heart of town with everything you need within walking distance. We had great meals at the local pubs and café and you can find just about anything you need at the local grocer! The home was presented beautifully and had everything we needed during our stay with lovely little extra touches like a welcome platter, bottle of wine, and some extra amenities which made the visit seem that little bit more homely. Highly recommend."
19180673,163491019,2017-06-25,44090237,Lorenzo,"Really kind woman, greeting us with a smile despite our late time booking and she even invited us to join her in a bonfire. 
The room is worth more than an hotel room, all new and clean, all furnished with kettle, tea and coffee as well. 
I highly suggest this beautiful place but keep in mind outside the room the site is under ""construction"". "

19180673,199450822,2017-10-02,68219104,Brittany,Carolyn is lovely and the place is cosy and very clean. The surrounding area has some stunning views and very close to beautiful wineries and Angastan.

I was definitely at home and felt I left as friends I will certainly visit again. Look forward to seeing your progress in March. Best wishes Steve
19180673,204810127,2017-10-20,24395730,Elisabeth & Thomas,"Carolyn and her husband were warm and welcoming hosts and gave us a lot of advice what to explore in Barossa Valley. Carolyn also provided a lot of information for guests in a folder upon our room. We really enjoyed our stay at her lovely farm, so close to nature. The room was modern and well equipped with a private bathroom and a heater (air condition) for cold nights. There were also some kitchen facilities (toaster, water heater etc.) and a fridge, so you can prepare your own breakfast. The farm is a beautiful and peaceful place, still in progress, and Carolyn and her husband have a big project to turn it into a nice campsite and guest suites. We are really excited how it will look like when it’s finished. If we’ll ever visit the Barossa Valley again we would love to come back to Carolyn’s place. Thank you so much for being your guests and all the best for your big project (greetings to your lovely animal grannies :-)."
19180673,207277994,2017-10-29,56981819,Wolfgang,Perfect place to visit Barossa Valley with very friendly hosts. We enjoyed our stay and can recommend it.

"
19180673,216660727,2017-12-04,6616190,Christine,"Carolyn and family (including the cute 4 legged ones) were wonderful hosts. Very warm people who made you feel as though you were part of their extended family and very welcome.   The unit was small but very comfortable for me travelling alone, had everything I needed and was great value for money.  The bed was incredibly comfortable and I had the best sleep ever!  The blind was fantastic at blocking out the light when you needed to but it was also nice to be able to open up the window or have the door open on the sunny days and enjoy the surrounding views and fresh air. There was no TV connection when I stayed but it wasn't an issue for me as I had my own DVD player and a good book. TV installation I believe is relatively new and connection on the way.  Wifi was a little problematic but again I didn't really need it whilst I was there and was able to check emails or (Hidden by Airbnb) via my phone anyway or use my iPad with Wifi at Cafes whilst out exploring.  Not any fault of the owner of course as Telstra are working on upgrades in the area so this is expected to be resolved in the not too distant future. The ongoing renovations were not a problem and the other historic buildings on the property marked for renovation will make stunning accommodation once done.  There were a few steps up and down to/from the room which were not an issue for me but I did make the wise decision to leave my large suitcase in the car and just take what I needed in my carry on bag.  Again, not a great issue and easy enough to work around.  The bed was worth it!  Great hot shower too and the room was impeccably clean. It was the perfect location for what I needed which was some peace and quiet to recharge my batteries and casually explore the Barossa.  I would definitely stay again."
19180673,219175014,2017-12-17,161923331,Pina,Lovely place to stay and Carolyn was a fantastic host!

The room was immaculate and in a separate dwelling from the home which gave me easy access in/out. 
They gave me some helpful tips on where to eat based on what I was looking for. 
Overall - exactly what I needed for my stay."

19180673,256859103,2018-04-24,16940409,Grant,I absolutely loved my stay at Carolyn’s place in Penrice. The thing I enjoyed the most were Carolyn’s local tips - she gave me a few ideas for wineries that were not on my radar and one was amongst my favorites! I appreciated the privacy of the room being apart from the main house but also knowing that Carolyn and William were there if need be. They even offered me up pizza one night. Great stay - highly recommended!

19180673,283957273,2018-07-01,40857397,Emeline,"We had a fantastic weekend get away at Carolyn’s place in the Barossa! 
We were lucky enough to be the first stay in their newly renovated barn house which was perfect for us! It was modern but held a lot of beautiful character that we loved too. 
The land the home is on is absolutely stunning and we were lucky enough to enjoy some winter sun with uninterrupted views of rolling hills. It was so peaceful and quiet. 

We were only a 5-10 min drive from town and the nearest wineries which was ideal! The farmers markets were fantastic! We had dinner at Roaring 40s in our first night as recommended by Carolyn which was great too! 

Carolyn and William were lovely, welcoming and so hospitable we will be recommending them to all our family and friends that’s for sure!"

The property is beautiful and the room had special touches that made you feel at home.  I cannot recommend this place highly enough and if I ever return to the Barossa (I am too) I will definitely book here again.  Thanks Carolyn and Co.

19180673,364598995,2018-12-31,122601458,Carolyn,"The room is quite small but very well organised, equipped and clean.

The room itself is cosy but everything you need is provided and well thought out, We spent one night in enjoying the quiet setting and sunset swim in the property’s pool! After our days of wine tasting we would enjoy reading books by the pool before Dinner! We were lucky enough to experience a colourful sunset which was a highlight. 
Would highly recommend staying with this lovely couple!"

19817750,194415369,2017-09-17,20024295,Jordan,Maureen house is brand new to the AirBnb community and it is truly lovely.  Set in a lovely picturesque area of the Adelaide Hills close to the Barossa wine district.
19817750,199447178,2017-10-02,29535451,Amanda,"This home was even better than expected! Large dining and entertaining space, perfect for a family or small group. Maureen was so easy to communicate with. We had a great stay in Mt Pleasant. "

19817750,216446186,2017-12-03,157598258,Tamara,"Very calming, stylish and relaxing. A very very quiet town with a supermarket 10mins drive away, you will love the simple layout of the house allowing couples of families to relax. 

Perfect for a glass of wine on the patio watching the birds nestle in the trees. 

Bring your own food and drinks to cook up a storm in a kitchen that has everything you need. 


The house is in the main street but some trucks are the only noise you’ll hear. 25mins to Barossa - such an easy drive. We loved it - I’m sure you will too!"
19817750,222872854,2017-12-31,7825490,Barbara,"Maureen was an excellent host, quick and clear with communications. The house is very stylish  and spacious.

19817750,259419132,2018-05-01,82978973,Katherine,"My family and I had a wonderful stay at Maureen's place. The house was beautiful and well appointed with very comfortable bedding.  We particularly loved the extra special touches such as beautiful linen, great toiletries  and small pantry items to use such as oils and spices etc. My daughters loved the fact that there was a cupboard filled with puzzles, games and paper for drawing.  Mount Pleasant is nicely situated in the Barossa to explore many towns and enjoy the sanctuary of a quiet country town.  We would love to stay again sometime and make it to the farmers market held on a Saturday morning.  Thanks once again."

19817750,272043257,2018-06-03,83181251,Danielle,"Maureen’s home was absolutely stunning. We were blown away by how picturesque both the home and surrounding property were. Having family over from Sydney and being able to show off what South Australia has to offer was incredible and to be able to do that from this gorgeous house was just the icing on top! Hospitality was outstanding, with milk, eggs and bacon awaiting us in the fridge on arrival too!  Couldn’t have asked for better and would 10000% recommend Maureen’s home to anyone else looking for a lovely getaway. "
19817750,280749072,2018-06-24,186724858,Chantelle,"Maureen's place is a stunning open living cottage house. The property has some stunning surroundings and the house it's self has been decked out in the best of brands for appliances, towels etc. the pictures certainly don't do the house justice. It has been the best property we have ever stayed at."
19817750,290116076,2018-07-14,159904293,Gulcan,"What a beautiful property in the quiet town of Mt Pleasant. Great for exploring the SA countryside: 20 mins to the Adelaide Hills and 30 mins to the Barossa Valley. Maureen is a great host, including spices, olive oil and any other essentials you need to cook up a storm in her gorgeous kitchen. Our kids loved the toys, dollhouse, sheep and alpacas. It kept them entertained for hours! The SA countryside in general is very family friendly. We will definitely be back!"
19817750,293207079,2018-07-20,5885361,Casey,"Beautiful location, really enjoyed looking out into the paddocks and watching the sheep roam around. Big house with lots of space, good amenities. Very well stocked kitchen. "
19817750,298000976,2018-07-28,78369549,Di,"Thank you Maureen for your prompt responses. We loved the open family area of kitchen/dine/lounge but also appreciated the separate front loung for those who wanted quiet time for reading a book. Personally we prefer slightly firmer beds, but loved the quality linen. Thanks also for our breakfast provisions. Highly recommended. "

And we loved the little country touch with Alpaca and friends in the backyard!"
19817750,343212523,2018-10-30,5095952,Kara,"We had the most wonderful time staying in Maureen’s beautiful home.
We were so sad to leave!

We loved waking up every morning to the fabulous view of the hills. It was so spacious and relaxing. I hope we are able to come back and stay again. It was exactly what we needed after a busy few months.

We went on many long drives around the Barossa which was fabulous. It was also nice coming back to the charming cottage at the end of each day.

There is a brilliant local farmers market about a 5 minutes walk from the property every Saturday. We got there around 9am for an amazing cooked breakfast! We definitely recommend that.

Down the road there is a butchers, pharmacy, post office and a fabulous little Cafe with a general store attached. This is all walking distance from the cottage.

We came from abroad and didn’t have any data on our phones so we bought a pocket WiFi from the post office which worked really well.

Maureen’s place is completely charming and definitely a hidden gem."
19817750,347152460,2018-11-11,159392839,Julie,"Absolutely beautiful home & garden.  The presentation and cleanliness were outstanding As was Maureen’ s hospitality.

Its bloody fantastic, when they say luxury tent experience they certainly deliver, next level glamping. Kate our host was approachable, accomodating and puts on the best cheese platter and breakfast spread we've ever had in an airbnb. The tent in situated at the bottom of their property next to a little creek with views from your bed across the paddock. Cannot fault the experience. It was a memorable stay. Will be back!"
20002372,235816035,2018-02-18,167680962,Scott,Fantastic and unique getaway. Amazing attention to detail with all the little touches throughout the tent. Highly recommend!
20002372,248594030,2018-04-01,126498957,Phil,"If you could classify a tent as being the “four seasons” of tents, then you have it right there! It is beautifully stunning, even down to the small details. Perfect in every way. Sandy the family dog came and visited us which was nice there is also sheep and two horses. (So make sure you take some carrots & apples as they love them). Star gazing on an evening is a must so quiet and totally dark."
20002372,318945622,2018-09-05,63289718,Gemma,"We had the best 3 nights staying at Kate’s place! Words can’t express how beautiful the tent is, tranquil and serene! The inside is outstanding and the bath is sublime! The views and the fire and wine, what more do you need for a relaxing get away! It’s right on the door step of the Barossa Valley! We had absolutely everything we could need! Kate is an awesome host, so kind and attentive! We had a great last night with the hosts! Honestly couldn’t ask for anything more! Toasting marshmallows in the campfire, watching the stars! The Tent is 10 stars! Highly recommend to anyone who wants a truest memorable experience! We had a fantastic time!!!"

The tent is stylish in decor and amenities with breath taking views. Which only got better at night when we turned on the fairy lights and little lanterns lit the way to the fire pit area. A wonderfully romantic, very private  unique place to stay.  
Highly recommend it for a special occassion. Hard to beat!!"

The location is the perfect home base to explore all the Barossa has to offer, but you could just as happily spend all of your time at the property too. Kate couldn't have been more helpful or accomodating. We had the most magic time and would 100% love to come back and stay again!"

Clean and everything had been provided for. Glamping at it’s best! The food left for us in the fridge was delicious and more than enough for breakfast. We even snacked on it in the evening.

Kate had contacted me quite a number of days before arriving with local tips and recommendations to help us plan our trip, which was super helpful! Upon arrival, we were blown away how picturesque the location was and how beautiful the tent was! It was extremely clean, very spacious and well equipped with everything that we needed. Kate and Gary were also on hand if we needed anything extra. I would highly recommend this property-I definitely want to come back!!"

Alicia was fantastic to communicate with."
20057093,242741013,2018-03-13,26512644,Ned,"Miriam's cottage is a wonderful little house in a quiet street in Tanunda. It was clean and comfortable and there were nice touches such as a bottle of beautiful wine and generous breakfast supplies.
Our pleasant experience was somewhat reduced by the lack of contact re entry details before our arrival and an old electric stove which only had two small rear plates working. That somewhat spoiled our breakfast experiences until we found an electric frypan hidden back under the sink. A drawer full of a jumble of kitchen implements, many duplicated or useless, is more reminiscent of a family beach shack.
A manual re where things are located, garbage arrangements, etc would be really helpful. Wifi is really an essential these days.
It seems that no one has had a really critical look at the house contents, customer relations etc for a long time"
20057093,287993126,2018-07-08,86476827,Emma,"We had a lovely family long weekend at Miriam’s Cottage! The home was clean, warm, comfortable & inviting with a lovely breakfast spread offered! Alicia was very accommodating with an easy check-in/out process. We would definitely stay again!"

Large lounge room and an enclosed room at the rear to relax & read. The kitchen has everything you need and plentiful and varied breakfast provisions were provided, fruit on the table and a lovely touch which was much appreciated was a bottle of wine with a cheese platter to welcome us which we enjoyed outside on the rear deck.

It was perfectly situated, both for exploring the local wineries and also within Tanunda itself, which is a gorgeous town with lots of beautiful eateries and shops.

A beautiful old house with lots of character and special touches that cater to your every need. The air-conditioning surprisingly is ducted and worked exceptionally well in the hot weather. The lovely character garden has lots of wildlife , with birds splashing in the birdbath in the early morning. The kitchen has all the implements and appliances you need  for cooking.

20079805,189800423,2017-09-03,98386375,Tonya,"This house/cottage was absolutely perfect for our weekend away! We were three couples, but could have easily had a fourth couple and no-one would have been on top of each other. It is beautiful inside with every detail considered through to bathrobes in all rooms. It is cozy, elegant and homely all in one. Suzie was an absolute pleasure during the lead up to our visit, and her response times were excellent. We were a 10-minute walk away from the closest winery and a maximum of 25 minutes' drive away from the furthest (that we wanted to visit). Loved it!"
20079805,202771194,2017-10-13,151185714,Richard,"Though we have traveled extensively for over 30 years this was our first Airbnb. Since my wife and I are traveling with our 21 year old son and his friend we felt that a house would be our best option. Overall it was an excellent stay.
The location is a short walk into Lyndoch the first of several ""wine towns"" as one enters the Barossa Valley from Adelaide. There one finds a bakery and  several restaurants (we had good coffee and breakfast at The Table Cafe), a small grocery store (for serious grocery shopping much better off in Tanunda) and a gourmet meat market (great house smoked salmon). The first several of the valley wineries are within a kilometer or so.
The four bedrooms are each quite unique and except for the one off the eating area have individual climate controls off the main system and are each decorated quite differently. The house is quite old but that is much of it's charm. There are many nice touches and features throughout such as two robes with each bedroom, a working fireplace (with plenty of wood) in the living room, dozens of movies, plenty of nice dishes and glasses, a propane barbeque (we did steaks one night). The master bath shower and jacuzzi style tub have a great view of the backyard and surrounding vineyards (though can draw the shades if needed). The backyard is pretty with the smell of citrus trees.
There was a supply of Nespresso pods with milk and a frother so good coffee was at hand!
Really nothing to complain about; overall cozy, plenty of room and a large bright kitchen when we needed to cook.
Suzie supplied us with useful tips before we arranged. We had a minor issue and were able to reach Steve the manager and had it resolved in minutes!
Highly recommended!"
20079805,207266427,2017-10-29,71210558,Liz,Beautiful cottage with gorgeous views....such a warm & relaxing space...
20079805,208313945,2017-11-01,48983705,Pip,"Fantastic spacious house, ample parking. Suzie was so quick to respond to all enquiries and was flexible with check in/out times. Well set up house with lots of amenities like coffee pods, condiments, milk etc. highly recommend."
20079805,211457320,2017-11-12,64694228,David,"Beautiful character house, the nicest we've ever stayed in. Was walking distance to the towns cafes and pub. Is a short drive to other parts of the Barossa. Really didn't want to come home!"
20079805,214913835,2017-11-26,82417544,Prue,"I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It is absolutely gorgeous. The attention to detail and all the little extras are fantastic, but it is the house itself that is just amazing. Suzie clearly has a passion and flair for interior decorating. We were 5 women on a 'girls' weekend and we when we entered the house we just were blown away by how beautifully it was decorated. And spotlessly clean. The rooms are huge, the 5 of us each had a large comfortable space and the living areas are also big and really welcoming. Great vibe to the house. Having 2 bathrooms was also good! Fresh crisp sheets, thick fluffy towels and bathrobes. Sitting on the back deck gazing at the lovely garden with the vineyards stretching behind was just what you want from a Barossa escape. Yet you have the convenience of a bakery and IGA in walking distance up the road. I will be telling everyone I know this is THE place to stay in the Barossa.  Was really convenient for everything we wanted to do there. Made our weekend away really special staying here,"
20079805,216443546,2017-12-03,110198397,Anna-Lisa,"Such a beautiful home, loved it"
20079805,225258867,2018-01-05,131966807,Loan,Amazing stay for 2 days. Thank you
20079805,230317104,2018-01-28,1016912,Stanley,"This lovely cottage was exactly as described and as appeared in pictures.  Lovely garden out the back.  Suzie was very responsive and sent through a list of things to do and places to visit as soon as the booking was confirmed.  Suzie was also very accommodating with check-in and check-out time.  We were there during a very hot weekend.  The air-conditioning was very powerful and cooled down the house very fast.  The kitchen was also stocked with all the necessary amenities.

I must say there isn't all that much in the town of Lyndoch, although it served its purpose as a base to discover the wineries in the Barossa Valley."
20079805,246696685,2018-03-26,118619193,Wendy,We travelled from Brisbane to the Barossa for a 60th Birthday weekend.  Suzie's place was perfect for the four couples with lots of space.  The house was full of the most amazing knick knacks. The outside area and surrounding gardens were beautiful overlooking the vineyards.  Everything we needed for our celebratory weekend.
20079805,253551832,2018-04-14,57568886,Nikola,"Great location,comfortable well presented cottage with fire place that made our evening vine and cheese plate unforgettable experience .We loved our stay in  the cottage and Barossa Valley."

It's our second time visiting but was Mums first, she was blown away by the decor and really wanted to move in! Absolutely loved staying and we will definitely be back!"
20079805,309842240,2018-08-19,83246162,Ian,"Such an amazing property. Would be great for kids, young families or couples wanting to get away. Its perfectly situated and so close to the local pub, butcher, grocer and restaurants. There is nothing left for you to do apart from relax in front of the fireplace with your recent wine purchases. "
20079805,326706468,2018-09-23,42156761,Castiel,We had a fabulous stay at Azalea Cedar Rose. We stayed for two nights to celebrate my 30th birthday and the house accommodated 8 of us very comfortably. Hospitality was impeccable and made our vacation all the more special. Thank you so much and would highly recommend!
20079805,332253510,2018-10-05,209468462,Meleah,We stepped into a dreamy and relaxing place. I cannot recommend highly.
20079805,344526796,2018-11-03,43163580,Deanne,"Suzie is a great host with good communication and was very helpful and knowledgeable on the Barossa Region.

20079805,422351361,2019-03-10,95067285,Sarah,Azalea Cedar-Rose is a charming little cottage and a wonderful base for anyone visiting the Barossa Valley. The cottage is beautifully decorated and has a wonderful homely feel about it. Sparkling clean. Our trip was a girls weekend away - we all live in various parts of the country and rarely get the chance to spend time together without partners and children around! We spent our evenings lounging on beanbags in the gorgeous gardens and enjoying the spectacular scenery each cheese and drinking wine in the lovely quiet of Lyndoch. Suzie was a wonderful host - very accommodating to our needs and so prompt in replying to any questions I had before and during the weekend. The cottage includes lots of hot tips for travellers and Suzie was also kind enough to offer lots of additional suggestions throughout the weekend. We are all already planning another trip for next year!
20079805,433590331,2019-04-07,72818727,Martin,The cracksin the wall just add more character to this gorgeous place.
20144446,198906852,2017-10-01,11079424,Megan,"Charming little cottage with fabulous shabby chic decor.  Lovely views from the backyard and a cosy feel inside, complete with fire place in the living room and large spa bath in the bathroom.  The kitchen has everything you need and the bedrooms were super comfy.  Only a short walk down the main street to the shops/cafes/restaurants and easy drive to all the main wineries."
20144446,206998365,2017-10-28,12712074,Cindy,"Jasmine's Cottage is in a tiny sleepy part of the Barossa, however it is very close to Tanunda and Nurioopta and Gawler is not far either. Sensational restaurants to try are Bistro 1918 in Tanunda and St Hugos Vineyard for a degustation lunch. Appellation at The  Louise is another fantastic restaurant but possibly more for a special occasion. Would also recommend Fino at Seppeltsfield for a more casual share plate experience. The Barossa for us is all about the joy of eating great food and the beautiful wines of course and this time was no different. Jasmine's cottage enhanced the experience as it is a charming little oasis to return to each day. Would definately recommend."
20144446,210009287,2017-11-07,42885493,Angela,We loved staying in this cosy shabby chic cottage. It was perfect for our weekend away to the explore Barossa Valley. Great info available in the cottage and some nice little extra touches. Lovely back garden to enjoy a pre-dinner glass of wine in the sunshine and a nice wood fire to keep things warm in the evening. Would definitely come and stay again. Thanks Suzie

20524750,281507275,2018-06-25,27682125,Kylie,Wow! The Reserve is even better in real life than in the pictures. Superb location to visit the Barossa. Simone had great communication from day 1 and went over and above with the information provided as well as local hints of where to go and what to see. We didn’t want to leave
20524750,282987006,2018-06-29,3943946,Ellie,"The Reserve is the perfect accomodation for any group looking for a self-catered home with all the mod cons!

20524750,325500818,2018-09-20,34809863,Victoria,"We stayed with our family for two nights for our small wedding, which we held in the beautiful gardens. The Reserve was a warm and welcoming place and was so close to great wineries (literally on the same road as many of them) that we even had a chance to visit a few. The fire was going and keeping the place cozy for our arrival which was a really nice touch. The grounds were beautiful - nicer than the pictures and able to be fully enjoyed even in bad weather, through the glass windows at the back. We also really enjoyed making our own pizza and using the pizza oven the night before the wedding :) All necessary equipment was provided. We had hoped to have our wedding dinner outside and although the weather wasn’t kind to us, the glass conservatory/dining area made a beautiful alternative and was more than comfortable and big enough for us all. The host was happy to allow caterers to come in to prepare our meal, and helped us with various recommendations ahead of time. 
The host was extremely responsive to all queries leading up to our stay and promptly responded to an issue with the gas supply on the night of the wedding. Unfortunately the temporary fix for the gas meant that there wasn’t enough for hot water for all 11 guests to shower before leaving the next day, but my impression was that this was unusual and ultimately out of the hands of the hosts, who had arranged for the gas to be replaced early the next day, but the suppliers didn’t arrive. Other than this hiccup - which I’m guessing is very unusual - we had an amazing time at the Reserve and will actually be returning in December with friends which we are looking forward to. I would definitely recommend staying at the Reserve."
20524750,341801247,2018-10-27,64198680,Johnny,"Beautifully situated in the heart of the Barossa. Amazing house/property with an equally friendly host - this is an ideal spot to visit wineries and/or just sit-back and gauze out overlooking the vineyards in our private retreat.
The place is stylishly modern and accommodates up to 12 people comfortably (2 x on stowe-away beds) for a perfect escape. Facilities are ample and there’s even an option to hire a personal chef to utilise the outdoor wood fire oven. 

Would highly recommend staying for a week."
20524750,361135302,2018-12-22,43474783,Katie,"Such a beautiful property with incredible views, gardens, access to the best wineries around and gloriously renovated. Booking was easy and Jodi, the property manager, provided exceptional service throughout. The owners even allowed us a late check-out with no extra charge. The beds were incredibly comfy and the kitchen easily catered for 9 of us self-catering on the first night. The only slight criticism was that the spa did not work. I'd planned the late checkout to give my guests (8 of them) time to enjoy the property and its amenities, which we were paying luxury prices for. However, despite one of the main reasons for booking the property being that there was a spa, it did not work. That being said, Jodi responded quickly, came out to the property (with a bottle of sparkles to apologise for the inconvenience) and attempted to fix it. Whilst she thought she had, unfortunately the spa continued not to work and we all vacated early."

The pods have everything you need amenities wise - coffee and tea making facilities, hair dryers and ample towels, clean linen and extra bedding for colder weather. The cleanliness of the place is amazing and the pods have been so stylishly furnished. It’s in a great and accessible location to all the beautiful wineries and small local towns.

20738665,258239601,2018-04-28,37286188,Christopher,"Monica's home is what often makes AirBNB so much nicer than staying in a hotel! Monica was an incredible helpful and friendly host. She gave us some great recommendations for wineries to visit and suggested other great places to find food - such as the local farmers market. 

She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed to feel at home, such as providing soaps,shampoo's and deodorants for our use in the bathroom and tea, coffee and cereal for breakfast in the morning. 

Personally Monica is very friendly and was great for a chat! Our only disappointment was that we didn't stay longer than a couple of nights! If we ever find ourselves back in the Barossa, we will definitely be looking to stay with Monica Again! (I also forgot to mention she has two adorable cats, which was a bit of a highlight for me!)"

I would actually give Monica 10 stars!
I'll definitely be back!!"

Monica has nailed everything down to welcome notes and labels, which mean all questions are already answered! Light breakfast provided each day, easy to access to the house if Monica is not home, Netflix, nice and private rooms, etc. Location was A+ also, and the knowledge of all the locals meant we were not short of ideas to keep ourselves occupied. We would definitely come back to Monica’s if staying in the Barossa again! Thanks, Evelyn and Steve xx"

21636564,213754765,2017-11-23,3753624,Gen,"We've travelled the world, stayed in many Airbnb houses and even host our own and I have to say that this was one of the most spectacular places we have stayed. Pembury Cottage in the beautiful Barossa Valley was idyllic...a picturesque historic cottage on the main street of pretty Angaston, walking distance to lovely coffee shops, a yummy bakery, restaurants, lot's of wineries close by (I could go (Website hidden by Airbnb) in the hub of wine/food heaven!) and the home itself was perfection. Kate and Jonathan have really thought of everything, from the quality linen, exquisite (and abundant) breakfast provisions, thoughtful touches that gave you the sense of being in an upmarket, comfortable country home and the rooms were light and warm (we were there when it was cool, but I noticed there were air conditioners, too). Bathrooms sparkling and kitchen like something out of Vogue (we didn't cook in it...too busy drinking wine and eating Italian at Casa Carboni down the road). We went as a couple but would definitely come back with friends as it sleeps 6. Great value and highly recommended!"
21636564,216046711,2017-12-03,160501291,Michael,We very much enjoyed staying in Kate and Jonathan's spacious and tastefully decorated cottage and have no hestitations recommending it to others. The cottage is just a short walk from all the town's shops and eateries and Angaston itself is just a few minutes drive from many Barossa vineyards and the much busier and larger town of Tanunda.

Parking is easy and it’s ideal for families groups. Kate and Jonathan have obviously gone to a huge effort to make the place comfy & welcoming. They went the extra mile and left breakfast and all those things you need on arrival aka. Milk, coffee tea. All the beds are amazingly comfy and huge. 
Anyone looking for a place that is ideally located in the Barossa should should choose this place."

The peaceful location, the small touches like the breakfast, fresh milk and bread, the gorgeous shampoo & conditioner, magazines, candles, rugs, comfy beds with divine linen etc. it's all these touches that make a place special and stand out from the crowd. It was a great base to explore the region and we loved coming home to our quaint historic house to unwind from a busy day site seeing and wine tasting. Thanks again for a lovely stay!"

Sharon was an extremely thoughtful host who left us a bag of goodies for staying, food and nibbles in the fridge, freezer and pantry which was absolutely great. Her soaps were amazing and the towels and linen smelt clean and felt great. 
The beds were a delight to sleep on and were nothing like the generic hotel. 
I would stay here a million times if I had to and would recommend Sharon and her property to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in the Barossa."

22294732,238790703,2018-02-26,164355261,Christopher,"The Hutch Hilton was the perfect getaway for our family vacation in the Barossa.  John and Jan went out of their way in welcoming us and showing us around the farm.  The rooms are neat and clean each with an ensuite bathroom and shower.  The common living area is well equipped with the kitchen necessities to prepare your own meals and enjoy each others company al fresco.  The vintage cellar door is rustic and charming filled with local farm prepared jams, jellies, and chutneys, not to mention their incredible wines.  Guests are able to buy local farm products to enjoy like their incredible lamb that we enjoyed.  Our hosts went to the trouble of supplying us with wonderful farm fresh eggs, local bacon, bread and milk, which was a wonderful treat. This historic setting is a true gem and anyone visiting is fortunate enough that the Angas family shares it with the public.  We can't say enough about this wonderful property and delightful hosts."
22294732,242450100,2018-03-12,175923517,Karen,"A wonderful setting - beautiful views, wonderful trees, fresh air and unique decor. Jan and John's hospitality was outstanding - could not have asked for more. Each of the four couples had an amazing long weekend - we were sad to leave."
22294732,249243037,2018-04-02,6451100,Antony,"Honestly, we didn't know what to expect when we booked - but the location was suitable for three couples who wanted to explore the Barossa. But our serendipitous booking turned out to be so much more than that.

John and Jan were delightful hosts - warm, welcoming, highly knowledgeable and always looking to help you with advice. The working farm has been in their family for many generations, and John gave us a tour of the property (stunning by the way) before a wine tasting of what they make on-site (some of the best we tried all weekend!). We were even fortunate enough to partake in a grape pressing for the next seasons wine bottling!

The living space/kitchen is an outdoor/open plan arrangement, but really added something special to our stay. And the occasional visit of the two farm dogs was always very welcome!

Without a doubt, we will be returning here in the years to come.
Thanks for an amazing weekend Jan and John!"
22294732,261142432,2018-05-06,17131826,Julie And Dugald,"Hutton Vale is a wonderful Barossa experience. The farm is beautiful with views over vineyards and paddocks filled with grazing sheep. The farm is just like a setting out of Country Style ! Grape vines trailing over rough stone walls,rusty sculptures surprising visitors everywhere you look. The accommodation is very comfortable with lovely bed linen, heating, electric blankets, fresh flowers and clean adequate ensuite bathrooms. Every evening we enjoyed a roaring wood fire  while relaxing in our ""Glamping"" kitchen/lounge shed. The sun streamed in every morning to make this area a cheery place for the breakfast gathering.
Our hosts were so hospitable and welcoming and there were many thoughtful touches around the place to make us feel special and well looked after.  Our evening lamb roast came from Hutton Vale and we also enjoyed a magnificent wine tasting afternoon on the property.
If you have a group of friends that all get along and love red wine ,log fires and relaxed country living I can highly recommend Hutton Vale for a stay."

Even though the outdoor kitchen is not well sealed from the elements and we were there on a  very cold weekend the fire kept us warm. The lamb we purchased and cooked ourselves was amazing.
22294732,317216305,2018-09-02,200709880,Jackie,"Jan's place is a home away from home!

Beautiful views, majestic gums, a place to relax unwind, a place to share with friends or family.

22294732,333121204,2018-10-07,213292123,Andrew,"Guests are free to roam a country property, both old-style and diverse in nature. We really felt relaxed, and free to come and go as we pleased. Lazing in the rustic lounge space with the log fire and games with the kids, no devices, local produce and a bottle of Barossa wine was a wonderful taste of a life once lived. Thanks Jan and John"

The property is stunning, the rustic set up is cosy and well-equipped, and Jan and John made us feel like part of the family. Of course there is also some delicious wines to drink and lamb to eat, and a few dogs to keep us company while star-gazing, which all added to the experience. We all adored our stay and can’t wait to come back."

Having a house to ourselves and our friends allowed us to relax and refresh. We used the BBQ to cook breakfast and enjoyed eating outdoors. All the amenities are of high quality. We highly recommend Alicia's place."
22347080,237410477,2018-02-23,1759846,Paul,"The house is a lovely place to stay whilst exploring the Barossa and even further afield.

There are some nice thoughtful touches, and there's plenty of everything you need to make the most of the well-equipped kitchen - including pods for the nice coffee machine, things for breakfast (including fresh bread and milk). There are towels aplenty, and nice soaps left for us in the bathroom; there's a good iron and board if you need it in the laundry room with what appear to be new machines. And the bedrooms and lounge room were perfectly clean and comfortable.

Communication at the time of booking, prior to arrival and during our stay was spot on - there was a very slight problem on arrival and it was dealt with graciously and quickly.

We stayed during the high temperatures (mid-30s Centigrade) and the air conditioner which is situated in the living room was capable of cooling all of the living space, although the double bedroom at the end of the corridor wouldn't get the full effect.

Thanks for making our trip so comfortable and homely, we would gladly return!"
22347080,237995252,2018-02-25,172753349,Tracey,Alicia is a wonderful host and 'Beds on Bridge Street' is very welcoming from the moment you step in the front door.

Check in was easy and quick. House itself very cozy and has everything that you need. Breakfast items provided by Alicia was a great touch and saved us a trip to supermarket. Only thing we thought the place could have done- a wireless Bluetooth speaker or a docking station to play some music as we had forgotten to take our speaker with us. Would definitely stay again or recommend to our friends. 
Great little find in a middle of Barossa."

I was raised in the Valley and it's a truly fabulous place to visit, conveniently located in near the centre of town yet on a quiet street, and staying here will be the very icing on your trip away. Luxurious furnishings with plenty to keep you entertained for a night in, when you retire to the bedroom it's what you'd expect from a 5-star hotel. Come hungry to breakfast - it's delicious and fills you up for the day adventures.  "

22622694,237184910,2018-02-22,172778180,Joel,"I booked this room just expecting a simple room to set up for a proposal to my girlfriend. What i recieved was the most impressive and warm hearted hosts i could have ever imagined. They provided free of charge cheese platters and wine whilst also letting us know great places to travel. Lastly, whilst i was at dinner, they added flowers chocolates and love hearts to our room to suprise my girlfriend with my proposal. They played such an integral part in perfecting the most important day of my life and i thank them so much."

The house is gorgeous and the facilities are 1 st class. 
Greg and Chris are such lovey hosts and they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. 
The special little touches are what make this place so fantastic and it is very close to the middle of the gorgeous little town of Tanunda.
Thanks for lighting our bedroom fire so the room would be warm on our return from dinner... so thoughtful. 
I can not recommend this place highly enough! I practically felt like royalty staying here!"
22622694,280708617,2018-06-24,1128303,Gillian,"We loved our stay! The room is beautiful with a large 4 poster bed. Every night Greg built a fire for our room, and each morning we were offered a range of amazing hot breakfast choices. The location is fantastic for Tanunda's best restaurants after a day of checking out the Barossa. Highly recommend! "

22622694,285118264,2018-07-02,33166810,Stephen,"This place is magical. The langmeil room was amazing, the fire, the bed and the spa, this room had it all! The house has lovely finishes and furniture and Greg and Christine were excellent hosts. Provided good local tips but also lots of little touches and extra amenities made this stay 10/10. Will be recommending to all our friends and family and our only regret is not being able to stay another night!"
22622694,336065567,2018-10-13,214500840,Gregor,We had such a lovely time. Wonderful informative and helpful hosts. We hired their battery bikes for a ride to Lyndoch and back. It was quite hilly and the battery assist made it so pleasant. The breakfast food presentation and friendliness was a real high point. Their care in presenting the rooms was brilliant.
22622694,349636305,2018-11-18,74028503,Chris,"Greg and Chris’ place is extremely well located, clean and well appointed.

We had the most amazing week and look forward to coming back to stay again hopefully in the next few years. The property and grounds were just beautiful! Definitely recommend Martinsell Manor to anyone wanting to stay in the Barossa region.
22636387,408251704,2019-02-03,111689336,Emily,"AMAZING! Peter and Marijan were great hosts, so welcoming and helpful! the manor was so beautiful and we were honored to be able to stay here, it has been lovingly restored to a high quality. It really takes you back in time through a wonderful building with so much heritage. walking up the stairs from the pool made you feel like a princess.
Thank you again and we will be back"
22636387,422371030,2019-03-11,226795254,Andrew,"We stayed at the Martinsell Manor for our 10year Anniversary.

Marijan and Peter have worked hard to restore the lower level to its former glory. 
They've done a wonderful job keeping true to history - from the beautiful rugs to the beds to the decor. 
Amazing effort - it really shows.

Its a wonderful place to stay - quiet, relaxing and private. 
A pool all to yourself for the hot days, a garden and near by pathways to go for a stroll and lovely soft grass to have some fun on. 

We stayed in the Gold/White room. Restored and decorated beautifully - very large, with a large TV AND King size bed to match.
The bed and sheets were extremely comfortable.

Marijan and Peter were the perfect hosts - ensuring we had everything we needed. 
They supplied the little things that normal places don't such as toothbrushes and toothpaste - and as well as adequate toiletries.

One highlight to our stay was they provided us with fresh fruits from their garden and Marijan's delicious plum jam! (As well as other items to eat/drink)
Its these little things that make going somewhere enjoyable and it really did help aid in our relaxation.

Thanks again Marijan and Peter for making our 10 Year Anniversary memorable!"

The room was clean, bathroom was spotless & the breakfast the next day exceptional. Walking distance in to Tanunda township. Everything about the stay was great! 
We will back! 
Thank you again for a lovely Barossa trip."
22794701,275418425,2018-06-11,187045775,Alicia,Loved staying at this cottage! Everything was so comfortable and clean. It is obvious that Deb has put a lot of time and thought into making sure that the place is “just right”. From the supplies in the kitchen to the way each room was set up - you really felt like a valued house guest. We started each morning with a walk through the videyards and enjoyed spotting kangaroos and other local wildlife - stunning! Steve was great too and nothing was too much trouble. Definitely make sure you visit their cellar door if you are there on a weekend - the wine and cheese platter were fantastic.
22855141,244032146,2018-03-18,158637810,Kirsty,"Our family of four stayed at Sally’s place for 6 nights and had a really fantastic time there. Staying at a working vineyard, especially during harvest time, was a fascinating experience. Sally and Martin were wonderful hosts, they made us feel very welcome. We were able to walk around the vineyard, watch the harvest, feed the rescued kangaroos (and the geese and peacock), we borrowed bikes from them, enjoyed a complimentary bottle of wine from the vineyard, were given lots of tips on what to do in the area and very much enjoyed Sally’s homemade cookies and crisps and the chickens freshly laid eggs. 

The house overlooks rolling hills of the vineyard and has a lovely view framed by the garden and lots of native trees; we loved just sitting out on the deck and taking in the scenery and listening to the birds. The house has lots of character with artwork and thoughtful touches including fresh flowers. It was spotlessly clean; we had lots of space; the kitchen was suitably equipped for the several meals that we cooked there, the condiments were appreciated, plus the fridge was stocked with milk, butter and some local goodies on our arrival. Overall we really enjoyed our time there and would love to come back for another stay if we make it back to Australia some day. Thanks Sally and Martin for a wonderful time."
22855141,251390048,2018-04-08,174139890,Paul,"Whistler Vineyard Retreat is an absolutely fantastic accommodation in the heart of the Barossa Valley. We spent two days with Sally and Martin and cannot recommend their accommodation highly enough! 
From the minute Sally and Martin welcomed us to their retreat, the kind gesture  of a complimentary bottle of whistler wine and platter waiting for us on arrival and the perfect location to enjoy a glass of wine on the back verandah and watch the sun set over the vineyards we knew this was special and felt right at home. We loved every moment we spent at Whistler's Retreat, and hope to return again soon. Thank you Sally and Martin, just perfect."
22855141,260772870,2018-05-05,51856360,David,"We really enjoyed our stay with Sally and Martin.  The setting is beautiful facing out to vineyards, in a quiet winegrowing area that makes for a serene stay with quiet, dark evenings that highlight all the stars you haven’t seen since you were a child.  Their friendly menagerie wandered about the property; their gorgeous peacock would periodically check in on us, and their friendly dogs and cat would occasionally come by to greet us as well.  Of course there are geese, the orphaned kangaroos they care for near their cellar door, and the chickens that provide your breakfast eggs as well.   We appreciated the fresh flowers, snacks, breakfast goodies, local recommendations, and their sincere and friendly hospitality.  And when we reported a minor problem one evening, Sally and Martin immediately fixed it.    Internet worked perfectly well even while accessing some data-heavy spreadsheets for work.  Over a decade ago we stayed at another nearby property where we had sole use of a guesthouse, and we really preferred our stay here, as we had all the privacy we wanted while having access to the recommendations and company of 30+ year locals when desired.  Don’t wait,....book this guestwing now!"
22855141,269100410,2018-05-27,156099057,Ashish,"The experience was nothing short of extraordinary. A perfect getaway in the middle of the beautiful Barossa Valley. Starting with an amazing, very warm host [Sally] to the most scenic/beautiful property with deeply thought out amenities and, what deserves the most mention, a collection of adorable pets [incl baby kangaroos and peacocks!]. A true gem! "

22855141,308166995,2018-08-16,56788834,Patsy,"One word: Superb. From the welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine, recommendations on local spots to visit, to just sitting and gazing at the wind playing in the trees; this was  heaven!  Gorgeous accommodation with thoughtful and interesting touches.  We had three days and could easily have enjoyed more.  A fabulous property. "
22855141,309857947,2018-08-19,64007556,Meghan,"The Whistler is one of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed in! We spent the evening by a roaring fire and Sally's incredibly well stocked kitchen, complementary bottle of wine produced on site and heated floors kept us extremely warm and happy. The location couldn't have been better for wine tasting and in summer, taking a bike ride around the vineyards (bikes offered on site), would be lovely. Sally's hospitality could not be topped and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to explore the Barossa."
22855141,313691704,2018-08-26,46049706,Louise,"Very clean and cared for rooms and property in a private vineyard setting.
Sally was an excellent host that provided us with everything we could possibly need including a bottle of their own lable of premium Shiraz on arrival together with a local cheese board.
We particularly enjoyed sitting around the fire in their garden at night sharing stories and a glass or two of wine.

"
22855141,331170117,2018-10-02,213086351,Nicola,Fantastic place to stay. Bottle of wine and platter on arrival. Cosy guest house in a stunning location.  Sally was an amazing host providing lots of lovely touches including the best homemade anzac cookies I’ve ever had.
22855141,338548326,2018-10-19,47058579,Pia,"From the very first message to Sally I knew I had picked a great place to stay! On our arrival she was so welcoming and offered us so much great advice about where to go and what to see, not to mention the lovely welcome platter and bottle of Whistler wine. It was also all the other touches, home made cookies, crackers and fresh eggs from the chooks in the back garden. We enjoyed a glass of wine on the back balcony overlooking the vineyard as the sun set, magical!! The accommodation is spotlessly clean and the beds are super comfy! Location is perfect and we were central to so many amazing vineyards and restaurants as well as the new Gin Distillery just up the road. We also enjoyed a wine tasting at the Whistler cellar door, beautiful setting on the lawns. All in all this place is the only place anyone should stay at when visiting the Barossa. Sally makes you feel so welcome as soon as you meet her and is happy to share her knowledge and love for the Barossa. We will definitely come back and have already recommended it to our friends."
22855141,352148897,2018-11-24,51261670,Jane,"Sally was a wonderful host. The personal touches (like home baked cookies, farm fresh eggs,  fruit) make you feel at home from the first moment. The home is located in the vineyard and is very serene, with the resident farm animals wandering about creating a very relaxed and familiar atmosphere. I highly recommend Sally’s place!"
22855141,356645410,2018-12-09,8296391,Anthony,"Amazing location to venture across the Barossa Valley. The host knows the area well and recommendations been great! This range from where to eat, drink, grocery etc . And she always response fast.

The stay been great with a nice kitchen to wipe up meals after Barossa Farmers Market, and having it on the patio, facing the sunset over the vineyard. Mornings are a delight to have the resident peacock going by, chickens giving freshly laid eggs and geese going by. 

The wines from Whistler packs surprises. Do spend time at their cellar doors, while children could while their time at the playground.

Lovely host and place."
22855141,405893638,2019-01-27,232483896,Outsa,"It was absolutly amazing. I can't say enough about how beautiful the place was. Sally was such a lovely host and had everything we could have needed ready for us. If you love piece and quiet, animals, pizza and wine then this is the place for you."

22869313,246173997,2018-03-25,3267039,Shireen,Very clean and comfortable cottage in a quiet village. The provisions were excellent and the linens and bedrooms very comfortable. The owner is very helpful and accommodating. There is no garden so if you have kids this is something to bear in mind. The restaurants and cellar doors are around 15 minutes drive (some may be closer).
22869313,323624171,2018-09-16,29606552,Scott,Every fine detail is catered for and all add up to 5 star quality accommodation. Such a beautiful and romantic little get away spot!

With next door neighbours like Charles Melton Winery and Rockford just down the road this is wine heaven. 
Then there are the hosts Marty and Bruce who made our stay even more enjoyable.

This place is well worth checking out if you are looking for somewhere unique, welcoming and central in the Barossa."
23487867,248666684,2018-04-01,17381489,Du Hy,"Marty and Bruce (and Tom & Jerry, their dogs) were wonderful and such gracious hosts. Marty had a surprise giant Easter egg present for us on our arrival and sent really helpful tips and information in the days leading up to our arrival. Beautiful sunset amongst the vines and also a private entrance means you almost feel like you have a much bigger space to yourself. Would totally recommend the stay for couples and solo travellers alike or just 2 friends who don't mind sharing a big and super comfortable bed!"
23487867,249824057,2018-04-03,55847799,Jen,"Marty and Bruce were wonderful hosts, and their property is magnificent!! Their home is so beautiful, and there is so much space  as well as privacy (if you want it). Krondorf road has several delicious wineries - you can literally walk or bike to them easily!! Marty and Bruce are also very knowledgeable and are happy to share tips and recommendations with us.

We loved our time at Koromiko and have already recommended the space to several friends.

Thank you for everything!!"

They are super hosts and made us feel so welcome.  Fab base from where to explore the Barossa & Clare Valleys.  We are cat people but Tom & Jerry were such well behaved and friendly pooches we couldn't help enjoying their company as well.

23487867,288028469,2018-07-09,8073031,Lauren,"Our stay at Marty and Bruce's place exceeded our expectations. They were incredibly helpful with amentites,  joyful and happy to share their knowledge of the area with a glass or two of wine. We discovered that Marty and Bruce are known quite well by the locals and everyone was extremely fond of them. Staying on Krondorf Rd was perfect aswe strolled between wineries for tastings and didn't have to worry about transporation, it is also very close to the main town of Tanunda. Their place is beautiful as a converted cellar door and it was magical being amonst the vines. Their dogs Tom & Jerry are divine and absolutely love people. I highly recommend staying with Marty & Bruce whilst visiting the Barossa as it will be a unique and wonderful experience for you."
23487867,290644678,2018-07-15,152923386,Roxine,"The place has such a scenic view of the hills and vineyard. It is somehow isolated and at the same time very easy to drive to restaurants and wineries (very close to Rockford, Charles Melton, Jacobs Creek). Marty recommended a bar as well, called Z Wine Bar, which was a good place to relax and have some drinks, with lovely interior design. Good value and very relaxing place to stay!"

The self-contained space has all the basics for a weekend away, with the private bathroom, kitchenette, and upstairs living space all kitted out with little additions to make the stay even nicer. Marty and Bruce were very friendly, sharing recommendations for the local area and responding to our communication quickly. We were able to meet their whippets Tom and Jerry, who are two beautiful, friendly boys. We would recommend Kulkawirra for any couple looking to experience a slice of the Barossa."

Awesome location in one of the best roads in the Barossa! 

Marty and Bruce gave us some great tips on where to go and also let us use their bikes. They even came and picked us up when we road too far! 

Everything you need for a perfect weekend in the BV!"
23487867,342573802,2018-10-29,50084160,Brian,Great Barosso Valley wineries nearby. Numerous shops and food venues should you not be into wine.
23487867,345744663,2018-11-05,18439847,Josh,Marty and Bruce are fantastic hosts! Can't think of a better place to stay when we return to the Barossa
23487867,347142198,2018-11-11,9176789,Helen,"Marty was a lovely, outgoing host. As I think was noted in the listing this property is still being done up - so there are some hits and small misses. The location is fantastic, you can spend a day (and we did) trawling up and down the road checking out nearby wineries. Do note that the property is on the side of the house, there was no disturbance overnight but we did find it noisy during the day. Overall, especially for the price in this region, we’d likely return. Marty was full of local tips which were great!"
23487867,352896458,2018-11-26,43473025,Tom,"Marty was a great host with great local knowledge, a number of wineries all within a kilometre of the house."
23487867,354468706,2018-12-01,1945681,Courtney,"What a gem of an Air BnB! We had a fantastic stay with Marty, Bruce and their whippets, Tom and Jerry. We had a great private space consisting of a small kitchen (no stove/oven but fridge, sink and microwave included), bedroom, bathroom and an upstairs lounge room with views across the grape vines and hilly backdrop. Perfectly located for exploring the vineyards right on the same road (on the provided bikes if you wish), and an easy drive to Tanunda and surrounds."
23487867,362659311,2018-12-26,119086921,Harry,A gorgeous location and wonderfully cosy accommodation. Marty and Bruce are extremely kind and welcoming as well as happy to help with anything. Stunning house and stunning people!
23487867,364035042,2018-12-30,13104907,Sarah,"We had a fantastic time at your place, great kitchen, incredible location, and riding the bikes around was an amazing experience."
23487867,368444601,2019-01-06,5157179,Richard,so you know where you are you're almost opposite Rockford Wines and a hundred metres or so from Grant Burge.Literally surrounded by vines and a 5 min drive from Tanunda township.  What's to complain about
23487867,402914323,2019-01-20,25730431,Daniel,"What can I say?!?! 
Marty and Bruce are the consumate hosts. The studio (which is actually an apartment with a library) is sensational. Set in an amazing architecturally designed building which used to be a winery (with amazing views of Barossa sunsets - which have to be seen to be believed), the apartment is fully self contained with a separate entry. Marty and Bruce were on hand at all times to provide advice on what to do (ie. which wineries to go to and other things to do) - and their advice is ""spot on""! Located in Krondorf Rd there is great access to many wineries (big and small), including Rockford, but I also loved Charles Melton and two very small vineyards - Epinosa and Krondorf Creek Farm - all four of thee wineries were within a very short walk from Marty and Bruce's amazing home! Marty's communication was brilliant and very quick,  including the first text inviting me to cocktails on arrival - what more can you ask for? 
I had the most amazing weekend - thanks again Marty and Bruce!!"
23487867,405897306,2019-01-27,107617318,Miranda,Marty is a friendly and helpful host who gave us some great tips for local wineries. The accommodation is spacious and beautifully located in a vineyard. Located in Krondorf Rd it's close to lots of cellar doors which we were able to walk or cycle to. We definitely recommend this accommodation!  Thanks Marty!
23487867,413699720,2019-02-18,66420734,Anastasia,"We had an amazing stay at Marty and Bruce’s airbnb. The location was extraordinary, the place was lovely - located right on their own vineyard, but the true standouts were the hosts! They were so welcoming, helpful and friendly. They also provided the best local tips and tricks that really made our trip memorable, I cannot recommend their airbnb enough!"
23487867,416701037,2019-02-25,141067451,Lucas,"We had a fantastic time at Marty and Bruce's Airbnb. It's a beautiful building, in the perfect location next to some amazing winery's. Marty had great suggestions of places to go visit, so even though our stay at the Barossa was brief we left feeling like we had experienced a lot of it. We will definitely stay there again in the future."
23487867,419427937,2019-03-03,239451005,Lorenzo,"The property was beautiful and the room space, kitchenette and bathroom were perfect for our short stay! The location was so close to such great wineries within walking distance. We were welcomed by Marty on the day of our arrival who was very accomodating with the time we arrived. Marty recommended many local wineries and restaurants for us to check out while in the Barossa. We spent our last evening with Bruce and Marty who are both such friendly and down to earth people. We tasted some of their wines and enjoyed a cheese board and many laughs that night. To top it off, they have two beautiful dogs, Tom and Jerry, which made our stay even better. We highly recommend staying here and we will most definitely be visiting again!"
23487867,421599686,2019-03-09,43408930,Lars,A great place with nice views over the wine yard. Plenty of room for two and an exceptional hospitality. Close to wine cellars and not far from quaint little Tanunda. Highly recommended.
23487867,425285074,2019-03-17,8311883,Damien,Marty's studio was a gem. Delightful rural location  yet in the heart of the valley. Our hosts were very welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend Marty's  studio if you are visiting the beautiful  Barossa Valley. Thank you both for your welcome. D & J
23487867,428354674,2019-03-25,64969895,Thomas,"It was a pressure to stay in this place as it was easy to get to and close to town. I will definitely be heading back with my partner next time. I also had the opportunity to have a meal with Marty and Bruce, it's always awesome meeting kind warm hearted people in this world. They also had great knowledge of the area and wine."

She was excellent to communicate with and met us on our arrival to show us through the house and share some local tips. She even had baked us some homemade bread! A beautiful touch!
We loved the wood fires which made the house warm and cosy. The house was super clean and comfortable and was the perfect place for us to base ourselves for our weekend in the Barossa Valley. We loved visiting the chooks out the back and having a cuppa in the sunshine in the beautiful garden. A real country retreat!
Thank you Amanda for your amazing hospitality :)"
23794806,266294521,2018-05-19,47240333,Sal,"Amanda’s place is absolutely amazing! When we arrived, the fires were going and the house was toasty warm and welcoming. The house was pristine with the finest attention to detail. From the pressed metal ceilings, to the heated floors, there was a surprise element in every room. 

Amanda was so welcoming and she was genuinely excited for us for our weekend away as two busy mothers who were in desperate need of some time away to relax and recoup. 

The roaring fires kept us warm and comfortable as we were able to sit down and chat and enjoy the beautiful home and gardens. 

This will be an annual thing for us and can’t wait to come back to Amanda’s home every year! Will have to try the sauna out on our next visit!!! 

Thank you Amanda for everything! 

Sal and Angie"

Amanda is a wonderful host. We were greeted with a cosy fire and a lovely bottle of wine. We enjoyed the outdoor sauna (even had a quick cold shower outdoors afterwards!!). Seppeltsfield winery is literally across the road. I would not hesitate in recommending 701. Thanks Amanda."

Amanda was incredibly welcoming and made sure we knew everything we needed to know and had everything we needed! besides the beautiful back yard, the house was so comfortable and going to the extra effort to make sure the fires were going and the house was warm was such a lovely touch!

We arrived to the fires burning & fresh eggs from the hens. The fruit & vegetable garden was also amazing. Amanda also offered to drop us off & pick us up for a night out. The tips on places and things to go/do were very helpful. 
We would highly recommend staying here for a wonderful relaxing weekend with an amazing host.
Thank you Amanda"

The garden is just wonderful and the house is so spacious, modern bathrooms, super comfortable beds, a fully equiped kitchen and brand new bbq. Amanda dropped off fresh eggs every morning from her girls :) with some fresh lemons and blood oranges from the garden. The cottage is so conveniently located, only walking distance to Fino (highly recommend it for dinner). Amanda's hospitality, local tips and her wonderful home have far exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be back!! Thank you Amanda."

23794806,421587691,2019-03-09,17379153,Lisa,"From the moment we drove up to the beautiful cottage we were absolutely delighted. Amanda met us and she was the perfect host.  Amanda took us on a tour of her lovely property and gave us a detailed run down of everything we needed to know for our stay. There was milk in the fridge and a fully stocked tee cabinet and she'd even baked us a loaf of bread (very much appreciated the following morning, so delicious!) The house was spotless and decorated with a very stylish eye. The beds were a dream and the bathrooms divine. We are already planning the next visit. We strolled to the wonderful local restaurant, Fino where we enjoyed a long dinner and walked home guided by the avenue of palms with the stars twinkling above us. Perfect in every way."
23794806,424482083,2019-03-16,187065879,Laine,Our second visit to Amanda's lovely B&B. A fantastic place to stay for a relaxing trip to the Barossa.

23794806,436835247,2019-04-14,248791913,Carmel,"Amanda’s property was a real surprise. The immaculate interior was coupled with equally immaculate and impressive garden and orchard. We travelled as two couples and although our visit was brief there was plenty of space to sit around as a group or enjoy your own space. 
The beds were very comfortable and there was additional bedding offered in case we needed an extra layer.
The kitchen provisions were very generous - we loved the fresh bread, eggs from the “girls” out the back and the incredible array of herbs and fruit left for us to enjoy.
We had an easy stroll to dinner at Fino - the torches Amanda thoughtfully provided made for a safe trip there and back. 
We would love to return to spend more time at this special property."

Very well set up kitchen with masses of cutlery, plates etc. Washing machine, easy access to line. Added extras include wine fridge and pool table. Two wineries within walking distance and easy access to town  and the rest of the Borossa. Fills a much needed gap in the market as a lot of Barossa accommodation caters only to couples."

The breakfast provisions were plentiful and delicious, the outlook upon waking in the morning spectacular and the house itself was carefully looked after! For two families it was the perfect choice as it provided space, a beautiful wood fire in Winter and lots of outdoor space to roam too! Everything was comfortable and well presented.

When we arrived, Matthew kindly walked us through the house and explained everything to us. There was also a nice welcoming breakfast to compliment the stay which was beautiful. Their place was extremely clean and the beds felt like I was sleeping in a 5 star hotel. Sheets were super clean and bath towels were also. The location is also very central to all the wineries.

It provided ample room for a family group with lots of catching up to do. The property is everything as described, kitchen and rooms are stocked with everything required for a big cook-up and the booking process was smooth.
Lisa was excellent to introduce us to the property, provided great support and assistance during our stay. As well, the get started provisions were fresh and more than ample. Thank-you and we recommend this property to anyone."

24314297,434477378,2019-04-08,48983705,Pip,"Wow! 3 mins drive from the heart of Tanunda. Amazing amenities. We were met on arrival to be shown around the property. Beautiful views, a tennis court, breakfast, red wine, chocolate. Very comfy beds. Not sure what else you could ask for! Highly recommend :)"
24503563,266294994,2018-05-19,18019066,Serina,"It was a pleasure staying at Neils. 
He was flexible with my check in time which was very helpful.
They also gave me a little heater & offered extra blankets to keep warm when I told them I was concerned about the cold. 
I'd definitely stay again."
24503563,274679196,2018-06-10,15792962,Bijia,Neil was a fantastic host. The accommodation was neat and clean with close proximity to Barossa Valley.

24503563,284658663,2018-07-01,24332568,Bego,"Such a quiet and peaceful place. Neil and Torsten were wonderful hosts. Communication was perfect, they made a fire when we arrived to keep us warm, and since the room, toilet and bathroom are on one side of the house and they live on the other, you can have as much privacy as you want. Recommended."
24503563,294249033,2018-07-21,201899836,Steve,Highly recommend. Exceptional service in a beautiful quiet location. Fantastic hosts.

24503563,333894524,2018-10-07,1957791,Jean,"Idyllic rural retreat but only about 2kms from centre of country town where there are numerous hotels & places to eat. There is lots to see in Kapunda itself but both Clare Valley & Barossa wine regions are within 30- 60 mins drive. Obviously own transport is essential.A great place to chill out, away from the hustle & bustle of modern life & discover that some of the  trimmings of modern life are not essential."
24503563,338930169,2018-10-20,27303786,Nickolas,"What a great experience. At first glance, a little off the beaten track. The seclusion of this Airbnb means absolute serenity and calm. The hosts are genuine in their engagements and very approachable. Do yourself a favour and ask for the breakfast, Neil’s home made sourdough is reason enough to go to the Barossa. Only a short drive to wineries."
24503563,358274847,2018-12-13,10162034,Rachel,"It was lovely to receive such a warm welcome from Neil and Torsten following a long day's walk. The accommodation is as described, and it was great to have a bathroom to myself (with a fabulous hot shower). I chose the evening meal which was simple but nourishing. It was lovely to sip wine and chat with the hosts into the evening. A very relaxing setting and cosy place to stay - great value for money."
24503563,361128438,2018-12-22,44365147,Patrick,"Our stay was lovely. Everything was perfect, specially the quietness. Would stay there every time."

24583210,290653142,2018-07-15,126589256,Terence,Clean and spotless. And well stocked kitchen and bathroom

It was well equiped with everything we needed including fresh milk and some other treats.
The cottage was perfectly clean and all furnishings were in good condition. 
The bed in the main bedroom was really comfortable, towels were soft and fluffy.
Checking in /out was a breeze.
All up its a very pleasant place to stay and we will hopefully return."

24583210,354495906,2018-12-02,50095829,Megan,"You should stay here. So close to everything you want to see in Barossa, with all the amenities you need to feel at home (even pod coffee!). 
Keith was a great host, his bathroom has one of the best showers in the region. He even left us a bottle of local wine which was perfect with our homemade dinner. Would definitely stay here again."
24583210,361625067,2018-12-24,232008425,William,"Wow what an amazing little place. Clean, comfortable and private with modern touches and an awesome deck to enjoy the surrounds. Well located within a short drive to many wineries, I highly recommend you stay at Barossa Valley Escape.  And those home made German biscuits - yum yum! Thanks Keith - we'll definitely be returning when next up in the Barossa. Will and Bec."

24583210,424478662,2019-03-16,22443307,Lucy,Keith’s Place was perfect for exploring the Barossa Valley. It was super clean and much more spacious than the pictures show. The apartment had a really comfy bed and modern bathroom. We also enjoyed the terrace for breakfast and appreciated the chocolates and wine that was left for us to enjoy! Would recommend to anyone looking for somewhere to stay for a weekend in the Barossa.
24781608,275448453,2018-06-11,17551620,Rachael,"What can I say! This home is beautiful! 
House was spotless, kitchen  had everything you could need, spa was incredible, views were fantastic and showers were lovely.
 Beds were incredibly comfy, more towels than we would ever need, and sitting in front of the fire was an absolute dream.
The breakfast/tasty treat provisions left were incredible, more than we could get through. 
Location was great, close to everything you could want or need and plenty of outdoor space for cars and bikes etc. Perfect for a wintery weekend away! 
10/10 would definitely stay again. "
24781608,283948546,2018-07-01,27813284,Kieran,"Staying at Pine Vale Cottage was an absolute delight. The house is lovely and has everything you could need. The provision of extra towels and food (well above a continental breakfast by any standards) by the host Hazel was very much appreciated by our group.

The back of the house opens up onto a beautiful rolling green hill occupied by a friendly horse. There is plenty of space for dining and relaxing with friends, whether on the back deck by the hot tub, in the lounge by the fire, or on the front porch overlooking the pine trees.

The bedrooms and beds are cosy, and everywhere you can see Hazel's thoughtful extra touches. 

I don't see how any family or group staying here could be disappointed. Thanks again Hazel for a perfect weekend away."

24781608,400676206,2019-01-12,231530845,Emma,"Had such an amazing stay at this beautiful cottage. The hosts, Hazel and Steve were so welcoming from the moment we arrived. They went above and beyond even before our trip. Hazel gave us suggestions and menus of local places to eat for dinner as we were arriving later in the day and she took the time to think of us. The house is so warm and cozy and the decor is timeless and beautiful. The outside is even better than we imagined and looks incredible at sunset. It’s a great place to stay to see Australian wildlife up close and personal, especially kangaroos as they come close to the doorstep in the evening. Their horse was also friendly and they have a cute alpaca as well. The hot tub was our favourite feature and it was relaxing to sit in it and unwind while taking in the beautiful scenery around us. Overall we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone!"
24813904,281494801,2018-06-25,9785772,Kamillah,Spent our wedding night at this beautiful house. It is in a perfect location to access Tanunda town and the rest of the Barossa. This house is massive and is styled really well. Would recommend and would definitely stay again.

And the communication and assistance with booking wine tours whilst in Tanunda was exceptional. Highly recommend the Highlights tour, we had a fantastic time. 
The house was beautiful and clean, with just about everything we needed to create a home away from home. Shops, cafes and restaurants only minutes walk but the kitchen was also very well equipped to enable us to enjoy meals at home also. 
The outdoor area near the pool was perfect for us to gather and enjoy a few bubbles, board games and laughs. 
We would absolutely stay again."

It is absolutely tranquil and isolated from the hustle and bustle of the main tourist drags of the Barossa yet extremely conveniently located near the A20 highway to Nuriootpa. The home was immaculate, spacious and very well stocked with everything you could wish for. We appreciated the wine and chocolates and breakfast provisions were ample and delicious.

The Main Street is only 5 mins walk, where you’ll find cafes, restaurants, gift shops etc. Chateau Tanunda and mini brewery only 10 mins walk, however if venturing to other wineries this home is an easy 10 mins drive to a wide array of options. 

The house and gardens are beautiful - with very large rooms and big backyard. The pool was lovely and warm when we were there which was a pleasant surprise. 

The host was really helpful, providing ideas and prompt communication. 

Would definitely recommend this home for a lovely family holiday or even for a number of couples keen to visit the Barossa region."

25153888,425303215,2019-03-18,12846514,Diana,"Tempted not to express how amazing this house is so we can always have it to ourselves! The photos do not do this house justice! It is grand and breath taking. Everything has been thought of and there are little touches throughout the house that make it feel so luxurious.  The cleanliness is another Level! It is sparkling!!!! Opening the doors to a fresh smelling house with beautiful music playing was the most gorgeous welcome and start to our holiday.

The swimming pool, lounges and overall backyard is spectacular. The bedrooms are beautiful with the most comfortable beds dressed in Vera Wang linen!!!!!!  The location is perfect and a 2 minute walk to the main Street of Tanunda. All wineries are a 5-10 minutes drive. 

Cannot thank Wendy enough for having us and giving us a much needed rest. We hope to be back soon."
25153888,427572752,2019-03-24,45404449,Dorothy,"Wendy is an excellent host and offered us great suggestions for our touring of the Barossa Valley.  The house is very comfortable and we loved the kitchen/living area for relaxing at the end of our day.  As the house is very central in Tanunda, it was easy to walk into the centre of town for dinner.  I can recommend the Foodland Coop in Nuriotpa for a wide range of excellent cheeses, deli items and groceries."
25153888,432138127,2019-04-03,213256002,Dorothy,"If we could give Tudor House and Wendy it’s host 10 out of 5 stars we would. Beautiful home with four very large bedrooms, two bathrooms and large kitchen and living areas. Well appointed and very clean. The location couldn’t have been better. We would definitely stay again."
25153888,434912866,2019-04-08,40920505,Kim,"Fantastic house, fabulous location! Very spacious and beautifully furnished this house has everything you could want. 

It’s a short and level walk to the shops and restaurants in Tanunda. 

Plenty of room to relax indoor and outdoors. There’s a lovely big garden, pool and covered area with a table, chairs and BBQ. 

The kitchen is modern and well stocked with loads of condiments and goodies in the pantry.

Communication with Wendy was quick and easy. 

All in all - you’ll love this place."

25928338,290152164,2018-07-14,92069202,Desiree,"When you talk about location this little pice of luxury is spot on.  The newly refurbished 3 bedroom house was the perfect break from reality that we were after.  The couch was comfy the heating was perfect the beds were amazing and so was the TVs and Netflix.

The kitchen was a pleasure to cook in and I can only imagine sitting on the deck (in warmer weather) with a glass of local wine and platter of produce  (which Sarah will happily organize for you) would be heaven.

Perfect for a couple, group of friends or a family as the property was totally enclosed and there was area for the children to play.  I would like to return with a group of girls so that we could indulge in a weekend of fine food, wine and fun.

Thanks for having us we had a very relaxing time.

The house is super clean and the kitchen is fully stocked with all appliances and Utensils- we collected food from our day and then cooked dinner at night it was great!

We had everything we needed, the styling was stunning and what a view to wake up to in the morning! We both slept so well on the huge, extremely comfortable king bed and will be recommending all of our friends to make a trip to the Barossa to stay in Angaston ASAP. Thank you for being so friendly and kind!!!! A brilliant mini vacay! Xxxx"
26009146,326732081,2018-09-23,24607186,Jessica,We had a wonderful stay at Carolyn & William's farm. The Barn is a cosy and beautifully presented space with a huge comfy bed! It has everything you need for a short stay. The Barn is located near Angaston  and close to many of Barossa's  finest wineries and restaurants. Carolyn & William were excellent and accommodating hosts with great tips and recommendations.  We had a wonderful weekend and would definitely recommend the Barn to our friends and family!
26009146,329885665,2018-09-30,21033719,Lucy,"Carolyn was very helpful and lovely. The room is 10/10 as is the location. If you're staying a few days make sure you come prepared with small goods like milk, fruit and snacks. The room was lovely and warm and the bed comfy. Would definately go back."
26009146,331210278,2018-10-02,24955775,Monica,"The Barn is a beautiful stay in the Barossa that offers peace & quiet and a lovely view. The driveway is lined with blossoming trees, the hosts are lovely & will do anything to make your stay special. The Barn itself is fantastic - beautifully styled, huge comfortable bed & has everything you need. The toilet/bathroom is a 15m walk away on a boardwalk, so no big deal. I loved the historical aspect of it. Sunset drinks on the back deck were everything we imagined in the Barossa. You won't be disappointed if you stay here!"
26009146,333909381,2018-10-08,73654768,Amanda,"'The Barn' is a well appointed room, the host Carolyn anticipating most of your needs before you even know you have them.  Most things you'll find in your room and it's only a short well lit boardwalk across to the amenities. Would definitely stay here again!"
26009146,338993934,2018-10-21,141674557,Janelle,"The Barn is the most amazing little place to get away for the weekend. The Barn itself and facilities were so modern, new and fresh. The location is perfect and just outside Angaston where anything we needed was a small drive. Absolutely worth every penny for an adults weekend away, drink some wine, eat some cheese, visit some wineries and sights and veg out."
26009146,340418536,2018-10-23,58952949,Mark,"Carolyn is a good helpful host and is creating a charming Barossa country feel. The room is an old stone barn well renovated with beautiful linen, comfortable bed and large fun. There is a nice private outdoor sitting area with country views.
However we were disappointed on arrival to find that the barn had no running water and the new  toilet and shower were 30m away up a boardwalk in a separate building. This is rather inconvenient in the middle of a cold night! To be fair the place description did say amenities were separate but it was not clear to us that this meant no en suite and the photos did not make it clear either.This needs to be emphasised in the advert as for that price one would expect self-contained facilities. We are sure when the renovations are complete this will be a great place to stay."
26009146,341416107,2018-10-26,90911355,JoanneJasper,Absolutely beautiful location. Carolyn is incredibly helpful and quick to respond in communication and provided lovely accommodation.  The Barn is exactly as described and pictured.  Thank you for making my experience so fuss free.

26009146,345743728,2018-11-05,85258073,Izzy,"The Barn was truly magical and was just what we needed for a long weekend getaway. Carolyn had thought of everything in regards to amentities, from extra towels and blankets to netflix and an array of delicious teas. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the peace and quiet of the Barn. Would highly recommend if you're looking for a romantic weekend away to enjoy some wine and soak in the peace and quiet."
26009146,348705008,2018-11-15,210920152,Chloe,Our stay was amazing! I would strongly suggest anyone going to the Barossa to stay at The Barn in Penrice. Carolyn is so accomodating and the Barn is in a beautiful setting.
26009146,350660264,2018-11-19,188614999,Bradley,The Barn is a beautifully located villa type home where everything you need is catered for. A great mix of old structures but modern facilities gives this place an edge on everywhere else. Would recommend.

26009146,358874535,2018-12-16,118945315,Jeremy,"Carolyn and family very friendly and room was beautiful with fresh linen, lovely soft towels and beautiful view of countryside as well as great connection to Netflix. However take care when walking to amenities as very poor lighting on path to toilet and laundry at night causing a trip hazard and suggest much improved lighting. Solar lights provide insufficient lighting at night currently."

26009146,420180485,2019-03-05,173156006,Don,"Highly recommended for anyone wishing to ""escape"" and find serenity.  A well thought out space, comfortable ""large"" bed and gorgeous outlook.  The toilet and shower a short stroll away from the barn wasn't a problem.  We decided to stay in each night instead of eating out as we didn't want to miss the opportunity of enjoying the sunset and relaxing in such a lovely setting.  The property is situated within an easy drive to ""everywhere"" in the Barossa but you still feel like you are in the middle of ""nowhere""!!!"

The king bed is super comfy & Carolyn has the place set up so well with all of the furniture & amenities. It’s hard to beat having a glass of wine on the deck watching the sunset over the fields! The lovely & spacious toilet/bathroom/shower is only 20 steps away and wasn’t an issue at all. Can’t wait to come back & stay again.

The house is a short walk to the town centre of Tanunda which was perfect for our dinner at Tuoi’s restaurant, FermentAsian. Tuoi was an amazing host, both at the accomodation and restaurant.

The house is tastefully decorated and the bed and sofa is very comfortable. The pool and backyard area, with its lovely greenery, is serene and relaxing. The backyard and house is suitable for a family getaway with 3 bedrooms, a well equipped big kitchen, and swings and a sandpit area in the backyard. Tuoi is a warm and helpful host, and showed us around and explained things on check-in. Thank you, again, Tuoi! My husband and I have been huge fans of Tuoi's restaurant, FermentAsian, for several years now - the food is amazingly delicious, fresh, and just a wonderful balance of South East Asian flavours. FermentAsian is one of our all-time favourite restaurants. We highly recommend both this accommodation and the restaurant.

26498571,344145935,2018-11-03,35954080,Janette,We really appreciated the heritage significance of the Goat Square Cottages. Our suite was roomy and very comfortable with modern amenities while still maintaining quaintness of another time. Kim’s cottages were in a great location.

The cottage is spacious and tastefully furnished, with great heating/cooling and a lovely shower. There are extra touches that add to the sense of welcome - books to read, a lovely tea pot and cups, a bench beneath a spreading oak tree. Remnant bushland is a short walk from the cottage, and a delightful place to walk and soak up the beauty of the South Australian scrub - complete with kangaroos and lots of native birds. While the cottage is close to the owners’ house, they have gone out of their way to preserve my privacy. I have truly had the most relaxing, refreshing weekend. Thank you!"
27065195,309823381,2018-08-18,198248102,Tamara,"Francis and Anne gave us a warm welcome! We immediately felt relaxed in the lovely bush land surrounding us. The cottage is sparkling clean, beautifully done and full of thoughtful little touches to make our stay comfortable. While the cottage is near the main house our privacy was respected. Anne also offered to collect pizza for our dinner so we could relax  The walking track around the property was lovely, and we awoke to kangaroos, galahs and parrots outside our door.  The forest nearby is great for exploring and the drive up from Adelaide was very scenic. An idyllic weekend escape for us. Thank you both "
27065195,312636717,2018-08-24,209399624,Maryke,"A beautiful self-contained Cottage in the South Australian countryside. Lovely facilities and very thoughtful hosts. you might want to stay a few nights, as it is such a short distance to the Barossa Wine Region. We only got to one winery and realised there was so much more to explore. Excellent if you are looking for a tranquil retreat.Thank you Anne and Francis for a memorable and very enjoyable stay."

27065195,336104512,2018-10-14,17618178,Andrew,"The cottage is cute, cosy and clean. We had a fantastic stay! The place was beautiful. Francis and Anne were very hospitable and took us for a walk around the 20 acre property and showed us their family of dogs. The cottage is out the back of the house so if you want your own privacy you can have that. We chose to interact with the hosts a lot which was really enjoyable. The porch of the cottage was a highlight, sitting there with a tea/coffee watching the birds, dogs, and nature was very peaceful. 

Highly recommended!"
27065195,340135695,2018-10-23,48732774,Hilton,"Quaint cottage in the woods - spacious timber / kit imported from Czech and with 3 way triple glazed windows, lots of light, french doors, wildlife nearby, Sheridan Linen, brand new, great shower and fittings, amenities and nice touches - flowers, chocs, etc. Awesome stay!! Near to their home but you don't feel that at all."

Anne and Francis were very accommodating and helpful. We found this place to be very clean, stylish, comfortable with everything you needed and perfectly sized for two people. The bathroom and shower was excellent. Furthermore, they clearly explained the area, and offered a guided tour of the property. I honestly think this is a bargain. We would definitely stay here again and we highly recommend this beautiful cottage."
27065195,350924567,2018-11-20,66533370,Alex,A beautiful cabin with everything you need for a comfy escape. The bird life was delightful and the walks in nearby forests were relaxing and enjoyable. Thoroughly recommended
27065195,352211938,2018-11-25,137021432,Alina,"We stayed for just one night, but wish we could stay longer.  Francis and Anne were most welcoming and cordial.  The cottage is sparkling clean and fresh, well equipped for tea/coffee and a light breakfast or snack (microwave, toaster, kettle and a small fridge).  The hosts attend to it with great attention to detail.  The bed is comfortable with high quality linen and towels.  Some chocolates and the fresh flowers were a nice touch.  
In the middle of the bush and near Mt Crawford forest, the air is  clean and fragrant, pleasure in every breath.  Several options for a nice walk right around, and plenty more of really picturesque walks within a short drive.   
A nice added bonus is the joy of watching the amazingly playful puppies (though they are already much bigger than most dogs we ever met).  Thank you Francis and Anne!"
27065195,367894160,2019-01-05,200561384,Donna,"Thankyou Francis and Anne for allowing us to stay at your lovely cottage at such short notice.  For such a short holiday it served its purpose well.  So peaceful and calming amongst the native bush and wildlife.   We loved all the extra touches and your hospitality as hosts was exceptional.  Will definitely come back again at another time of year to see the changes in the flora and fauna.   Thankyou,   Donna and Michael."

We just loved all the thoughtful touches, the breakfast provisions were ample and decadent, the bathroom and kitchen were generously appointed, and the location was superb. The home is absolutely spotless and everything is to hand. Our daughter adored sleeping in a canopy bed and cried when it was time to leave. An absolutely wonderful stay; we'll be back.

The villa itself was beautiful, with lovely linen and a stunning bathroom with an excellent spa bath. 
The view was spectacular and sitting out on the little deck with the local wine and cheese we collected during the day was a perfect end to the day. 
Amazing photo opportunities and it is so private.
If you need help Nelly is happy to help but on the other hand if you like your privacy he is more than respectful of this. 
Would definitely recommend staying here. Perfect for a romantic couples get away and some quiet time."

Your stays were exactly what we need when visiting the Barossa for our friends wedding. 

Conveniently located at the start of the Barossa Valley trail, close to everything and the overall easy of getting to and from your place was so great.

The amenities and presentation of the accommodation was perfect, my partner and I can’t complain about a thing, you have certainly thought of everything; from superb linen to dual shower and a spa all overlooking the gorgeous vineyard.

We didn’t get to explore the farm but the views here are lovely."

The place was open and airy, very clean and had everything we could ask for. Steve was available if we needed him, but wasn’t in your way at all.

Highly recommended Steve’s house as a base for a tour of the Barossa / Eden Valley."
27819034,363049610,2018-12-27,11321944,Foo,Steve’s place is at the foothills of Menglers Hill and within proximity to Tanunda town. The place is spacious and full of surprises. We truely enjoyed our stay at Steve’s home.

Great base for Barossa adventures!"
27819034,403464043,2019-01-20,236634577,Steve,"Steve's place is clean, spacious, the bed is comfortable and there are some great mountain views. The distance from the town centre is perfect and the hosts are very welcoming but not in your face. My only criticism would be that, as this is a home based condiments production business, there is some early morning noise from vehicles etc. which may annoy those who are not early risers."

They were very welcoming and helpful with local information. I shared a wine with them in their living room as I was travelling alone, but they would have just as happily left me to my own devices with complete privacy if that’s what I was after. Wonderful considerate hosts. Loved all the little luxury touches, good sheets & pillows (I slept like a log!!) and a lovely breaky! Private entry access too. A really wonderful Barossa experience. Highly recommend this property."

This is my favourite town, with its friendly locals and its handful of restaurants, small bars, and shops. 
This stylish townhouse is perfectly located in a quiet side street, only three minutes walk from the town centre of Tanunda. Well appointed, convenient, comfortable, and full of Barossa Valley informational reading material. Some of which is even written and published by Noris himself, a charming host and accomplished historian. 
Thanks for everything, Noris."

It is also in a perfect location for tourist places to visit in and around the Barossa including lots of wineries etc.
The special touches such as chocolates, wine, cereal and breakfast spreads were greatly appreciated and we must not forget, even coffee pods were stocked in the cupboard.  Too many times we go to places where there is a coffee machine and no pods.  
The accommodation is within easy walking distance to many restaurants and cafe's so we could leave the car at home.
Everything was just perfect, definitely a 10/10"
28645066,413017245,2019-02-17,218710362,Michelle,Would recommend this place to anyone

29170994,403462133,2019-01-20,31189873,Amanda,"Darren’s place is really lovely - you get the downstairs section of a two storied house which is completely seperate and private from upstairs. The bed and couch overlook the nice big windows out to the front garden which was lovely. We had the windows open (screens on windows so no bug issues!) and heard lots of lovely bird calls as the sun set.
Nice and close to the township, we visited the Roaring 40s for dinner (excellent pizza!) and The Company Kitchen for breakfast (wonderful food - didn’t need lunch!). 
Very comfortable bed, lovely view, excellent location - definitely will come back next time we’re in the Barossa."

29915383,351182080,2018-11-21,179310375,Karen,"I was extremely grateful for Vicki's hospitality, especially when it was at such short notice. I was blown away by the size of the room and absolutely LOVE the feel of the entire house. Breakfast next door at the Wholesome Living store was delicious, and was so pleased to be eating it by the fire, after a very cold snap!! I will be back next time I'm out your way Vicki. Thank you so much!"

29915383,363991010,2018-12-29,30509604,Angela,"Very unique style, the room was a bit hot due to the heat wave and lack of air con.  The room was cosy, clean and in great conditions. Vicki came earlier to switch on the fan which helped a lot."
29915383,406752525,2019-01-30,165843735,Brooke,"Clean, stylish and fun spaces to unwind after a long day was perfect. The house stays cool throughout the day- even when it goes 40° (also an amazing a/c unit!)
Super close to amenities in Freeling (grocery store and bars just down the road!) and only about 10 or so minutes away from some of the most incredible wineries in the Barossa.
Vicki was an absolutely incredible host. If I problem did arise- it was quickly solved. Kept the house clean and always stocked full of the basics!Lots of information on the surrounding area can be found in the spacious common room. 
Without a doubt would stay again ❤️
She also has a SUPER cute store right next store. 
Thank you SO much Vicki (&family) for everything; the best host I could have asked for!"
29916072,354454333,2018-12-01,225349023,Krystyna,What a little gem this place is in the heart of Freeling- we stayed one night & wish we could of stayed longer. A wonderful little space right next door to the Wholesome Living Store - where we got great coffee & stocked up on environmentally friendly goodies. Thank you Vicki - a gorgeous stay in a gorgeous room at an exceptional price

Loved the vibe at the house with the three bedrooms named ""Peace"" ""love"" and ""Happiness"" 
Bedroom was spacious and homely, comfortable bed!
Breakfast at Vicki's store which is just next door was SO good! Enjoyed looking around in the store.
Would definitely stay here again and recommend to travellers.
Vicki was very helpful with tips on walking trails, she even printed the information for us."

29975093,365003570,2018-12-31,9240607,Paul,Fantastic little cottage full of period features and right in the Main Street. You won’t be disappointed if you stay her!

29975093,415968329,2019-02-24,16844836,Tracy-Lee,"Beautiful cottage with old world charm. Location was wonderful a short walk to restaurants and shops. The coffee machine was great in the mornings. Wine, chocolates, and bath bombs were an extra surprise.  Definitely, a lovely place to stay."
29975093,427099373,2019-03-23,121918627,Leeanne,Gorgeous and quaint cottage very well located walking distance to everything.
29975093,432414129,2019-04-03,129811770,Kate,"If you want something a little left of centre then this is the place for you. So well appointed with lots of thoughtful little extras. Comfortable, clean and quirky. The second bedroom is a thoroughfare to the lounge and the place is on the Main Street so at peak times there is vehicle noise. Neither of these points would hinder us staying again as the good definitely outweighed any negative."
30026334,366624620,2019-01-03,6477221,Daniel,Great stay in the Barossa. The cottage was exactly as stated and perfect for our stay so that we could explore the surrounding wineries! Thanks so much for having us
30094352,364997400,2018-12-31,225993015,Natalia,"As I walked in on a hot day, the air con was already on and music was playing on the retro radio. Loved everything about this place - could not have asked for more, from the yummy breakfast provisions, wine,cookies.... to the super comfortable bed and amazing shower. Even the outhouse toilet was luxurious. Everything was truly perfect - and I’m very fussy! I loved it so much I extended an extra 2 nights and lucky for me it was available - hope to be back one day"
30094352,400377451,2019-01-11,233231345,Dave,"Angaston is a beautiful town in the Barossa Valley. We thought the accommodation was amazing and the little touches made
it feel like a home away from home. All credit goes to Sue and Mike for making us feel very welcome...we cant recommend  
The Rusty Olive enough!"
30094352,417056840,2019-02-25,155719951,Jessica,"Sue and Mike’s place was absolutely beautiful. When I arrived the cottage was exactly like it is in the pictures, very cute and absolutely spotless.
I didn’t have any issues sleeping as the cottage very private and located on a quiet street, so there were no issues with noise. Also, the bed is absolutely huge and so comfortable! The bathroom is also very luxurious, especially the huge bathtub, and I really enjoyed using the rain shower.
The included gourmet breakfast was very extensive and delicious. The kitchen itself was very well equipped; with everything I needed to cook if I needed to.
I only stayed for one night, but I did notice the barbeque out the back which I would have loved to try if I had more time. The private outdoor area was really beautiful and would have been a nice place to sit and spend some time or eat a meal if I had stayed a few extra nights. The cottage also had an outhouse toilet that I thought was kind of quirky but also very cool. 
The cottage itself is just around the corner from the main street of Angaston, so access to restaurants, cafes and shops is super simple – just a few minutes walk from the cottage. The hosts also provided a heap of great information on other activities and dining options around the Barossa which really helped me plan activities for my trip.
Overall, I thought the cottage was incredibly beautiful and clean and definitely worth the price. I wouldn’t hesitate to book again if I was staying in the area."
30094352,420183386,2019-03-05,110995071,Claire,"The Rusty Olive has been lovingly restored and is beautifully presented. It is spotlessly clean and has everything you need for a very comfortable stay. 
We wish we had booked for longer and we would definitely stay again."

30094352,433580154,2019-04-06,164853079,Bridget,We cannot fault anything about Sue & Mike’s place. Everything was perfect! The little touches were amazing. It was in a fantastic location and was the most amazing cute little romantic airbnb. Seriously recommend!!!

31060522,422383618,2019-03-11,169937559,Helen,"A lovely retreat, quiet and peaceful, close to the Barossa, which is perfect for a long weekend. We enjoyed getting away from the city, taking walks, playing board games and pool, reading and sleeping. We woke in the mornings to bird calls and watched hares running around. A good selection of books and Barossa tourist information is provided. The kitchen was well-stocked (including home-baked bread), there is a BBQ on the verandah and the detached bathroom was near-new and sparkling clean. Sue and Andrew left clear instructions for using the quaint stove and the solar power. It would be good to return in winter to make use of the fireplace and potbelly stove, and see the creek running.  Kids would have fun on the trampoline, flying fox and kicking the footy."
31060522,424480957,2019-03-16,62855532,David,Although the countryside was very dry the cottage is like a little oasis. The dog enjoyed her stay very mu h and we were greatly relaxed. It was not the Ritz but has everything needed for a relaxing holiday. Thanks

31060522,437608201,2019-04-14,113167151,Tara,My husband and I absolutely loved staying at this little off grid cottage as a half way stop on out road trip. The bed is super comfy and the bathroom is beautiful. Such a cozy space to unwind from the chaos that life can bring. We lived sitting by the fire each night playing board games and our day trips into the Barossa Valley which is so close. We will deffinately be back in the warmer months to spend a bit of time on the great verandah.
